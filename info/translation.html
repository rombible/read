<h3><font ><b>Bible History</b></font> <b>FLOWCHART</b>
</h4>

<p>In 2004 I asked myself the question, <i>Where did the Bible we read today
come from? </i>There were many web pages on this subject, but they either treated
the subject at a superficial or in-depth level. I couldn't find a flowchart,
timeline or chronology,
that tied it all together rather than just being a inventory of
Bibles and when they were published.<br>
<br>
So I surfed the web, consulted a few reference books, and came up with the
following. I'm sure the scholars may cringe, but it helped me. I've tried to
steer a middle course through the myre of history, especially the reformation
that was pivotal to the Bible's history in the late Middle Ages.
</p>

<p>The rest of this page contains notes on the left, and the flowchart on the
right. With a high resolution monitor you will see both together, or you can use
the scroll bar to flick between them. Alternately use the following table, or the heading
links in the text to open a separate page with the flowcharts so you can read the notes and view the chart at the same time.<br>

<p>The roots of the Bible go back over 3000 years, and we must consider the
society and practices in that era.</p>
<ul>
  <li>An excellent oral tradition - something that we have lost. e.g. the
    ability to memorise all the Psalms as an on-line hymnary.</li>
  <li>The few scholars that had access to documents had poor documentation
    control. Old documents were not handed down to us because they were used, then copied just before they ended their useful life.
    The copiers were very accurate, but this does account for the difficulty in
    finding ancient manuscripts.</li>
  <li>Up to Jesus' time, writing something as a ghost writer was seen as
    veneration of that person not forgery, as is sometimes suspected with some
    NT writings.

<p><b>HEBREW</b> The original manuscripts for the OT. Written between 1450 <span style="font-variant: small-caps">BC</span> and 400 <span style="font-variant: small-caps">BC</span>. Written in archaic Hebrew, gradually changed to modern square script
Hebrew after 400 <span style="font-variant: small-caps">BC</span>, and still used to this day. Around 500
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">AD</span> the Masoretes developed a system of vowel and accents
to punctuate the text, they also standardised the text and content, preparing it for printing much later (Psalter 1477, Full OT 1488).
The oldest surviving  material was the Masoretic from the 9<b>C</b>, until the Dead Sea Scrolls
were discovered in 1947 from 2-1<b>C</b> <span style="font-variant: small-caps">BC</span></p>
<p>Certain portions of the OT (Daniel and Ezra mainly) are written&nbsp;in Aramaic. Aramaic was used from
900<span style="font-variant: small-caps">BC</span> onwards. Aramaic was used by the common people, while Hebrew
remained the language&nbsp;of religion and government and of the upper class.&nbsp;Jesus and the Apostles are believed to have spoken Aramaic, and&nbsp;Aramaic-language translations (Targums) of the Old Testament circulated.&nbsp;Aramaic continued in wide use until about
650<span style="font-variant: small-caps">AD</span>, when it was supplanted&nbsp;by Arabic.</p>
<p><b>SEPTUAGINT</b> or <span style="font-variant: small-caps"> LXX</span>, from the story that 72 scholars (6 from each of the 12 tribes)
working in 12 groups produced 12 identical Greek translations from Hebrew, although analysis shows widely differing
Greek styles. As Greek became the daily language of the Jews in Egypt the translation&nbsp;was made.
The Torah, or Pentateuch (first 5 books of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">OT</span>) in
3<b>C </b><span style="font-variant: small-caps">BC</span> and&nbsp;the rest in 2<b>C</b>
<span style="font-variant: small-caps"> BC</span>. The Septuagint contains 29
Old Testament and 14 Apocrypha books.</p>
<p>The language of much of the early Christian church was Greek, the Jews did&nbsp;not like this "highjacking" of their scripture, so
Rabbis met at the city of&nbsp;Jamnia or Javneh in 90
<span style="font-variant: small-caps"> AD</span> to determine which books were truly the Word of God.&nbsp;They pronounced many books, including the Gospels, to be unfit as scriptures.&nbsp;This canon also excluded seven books (Baruch, Sirach, 1 and 2 Maccabees, Tobit,&nbsp;Judith, and the Wisdom of Solomon, plus portions of Esther and Daniel) that&nbsp;Christians considered part of the Old Testament.
The Septuagint's subsequent history is in the Christian church.</p>
<p>
    In the 3 <b> C</b> <span style="font-variant: small-caps">AD</span> Origen attempted to clear up copyists' errors that had crept&nbsp;into the text of the Septuagint, which by then varied widely from copy to&nbsp;copy. Other scholars also consulted the Hebrew text in order to make the&nbsp;Septuagint text more accurate. But it was the Septuagint, not the original&nbsp;Hebrew, that was the main basis for the&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Old Latin,&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Coptic, peasant communities of Egypt (late 3 <b> C</b> <span style="font-variant: small-caps"> AD</span>)&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    Ethiopic, written after conversion to Christianity 4-5 <b> C</b> <span style="font-variant: small-caps"> AD</span>.&nbsp;Earliest surviving version 13
    <b>C </b><span style="font-variant: small-caps"> AD</span>.</li>
  <li>Armenian, result of nationalist upsurge and church split in 5 <b> C </b><span style="font-variant: small-caps"> AD</span>.&nbsp;Noted for its beauty &amp; accuracy.</li>
  <li>Georgian, 5 <b> C</b> <span style="font-variant: small-caps"> AD</span>, some parts may be based on the Armenian version.</li>
</ul>
<p>as well as the Slavonic (numerous translations over the centuries starting 1 <b> C</b> <span style="font-variant: small-caps"> AD</span>.)
and part of the Arabic translations of the Old Testament. The Septuagint has
always been the standard version of the OT in&nbsp;the Greek church, and from it Jerome began his translation of the&nbsp;Vulgate
OT.</p>
<p>Earliest surviving versions of the Septuagint (&amp; therefore the NT) are&nbsp;Codex Vaticanus (B) and the Codex Sinaiticus (S), both from the 4th
<b> C</b> <span style="font-variant: small-caps">AD</span>,&nbsp;and the Codex Alexandrinus (A) from the 5
<b>C</b> <span style="font-variant: small-caps">AD</span>. Fragments of Acts, Revelation,
John and Luke from as early as 3 <b>C</b> <span style="font-variant: small-caps">AD</span>
also exist in various documents.</p>
<p><b>VULGATE</b> This most famous Latin translation was by St Jerome, sponsored by Pope
Damasus,
with it's first edition in 383 <span style="font-variant: small-caps"> AD.</span>
 It was initially from the Septuagint Greek version of the Old Testament,&nbsp;but the revised version of 405
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">AD</span>  used Hebrew
(Jerome felt the Greek was inadequate so re-translated it) for the OT,&nbsp;New Latin translations of the Psalms (the so-called Gallican Psalter),
and thehe NT
was compiled mainly from already existing Latin versions.&nbsp;</p>
<p> The 80 book bible (39OT, 14A, 27NT)
was revised and corrected over the years, the first printed versions were&nbsp; the much respected University of Paris edition from the
13<b>C</b>.</p>
<p> 
    In 1546 the Council of Trent decreed that the Vulgate was the exclusive&nbsp;Latin authority for the Bible. It required its printing with as few errors
    as possible, resulting in the so-called (Pope) Clementine (VIII) Vulgate of&nbsp;1592, with 80 Books. It became the authoritative
text of the Roman Catholic Church. From it the Confraternity Version was translated in 1941 and in 1965 the
revised edition authorised by the 2nd Vatican Council.&nbsp;</p>

    - 1611<span style="font-variant: small-caps">AD</span>
</h4>

<p><b>TEXTUS RECEPTUS (Received Text)</b> Due to the original Greek having hundreds of custom symbols, even with the advent of printing around 1450
<span style="font-variant: small-caps"> AD</span> it took until 1516 <span style="font-variant: small-caps">AD
</span>for the Greek to be widely available, in a special reduced Greek character set. Printer John&nbsp;Froben of Basle (who stole a march on Cardinal
Ximenes) engaged Desiderius&nbsp;Erasmus who produced a dual Greek/Latin version.&nbsp;The edition was full of errors, and not traceable to particular&nbsp;Greek originals. It was an instant success, reprinted with corrections&nbsp;several times, and led to nearly 200 successors, all suffering from errors to&nbsp;a certain degree between 1516 and 1550. The damage was
done, the world was&nbsp;flooded with erroneous Greek text.
</p>

<p>1550 <span style="font-variant: small-caps"> AD </span>saw the publication of Robert Stephanus's TR, whose third edition became
    the standard text, as it started to introduce rigour sadly lacking in previous
    work. He is credited with devising the chapter and verse delineations used to
    this day. 1633 <span style="font-variant: small-caps"> AD </span>saw further refinement by Elzevir, and the "final" major edition
    is the 1873 Oxford edition.
</p>

<p>The Textus Receptus is thus very far from it's Latin name, received text,
    it is a vast range of the Greek, of variable quality. Whilst making the Greek
    available to a wide range of scholars through printing, it also introduced&nbsp;many errors to this audience.
</p>

<p><b>AND SO TO ENGLISH...</b> By 600 <span style="font-variant: small-caps">AD</span> <i>Latin</i> was the
only Language allowed for Scripture by the Rome authorities. However for the
next 700 years there were numerous limited translations, of which Caedmon's
rendering of Bible stories into Anglo Saxon in 680 <span style="font-variant: small-caps">AD,
</span>and  King Alfred had parts of bible translated into the vernacular in 995
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">AD</span> are worthy of a mention.
</p>

<p>In 1382 <span style="font-variant: small-caps">AD</span> (updated 1400 <span style="font-variant: small-caps">AD</span>)
Wycliffe produced the first true English Bible, containing all 80 books, each
copy was handwritten.
Some copies survived of his work which was based on the Vulgate, its major weakness.
<br>The die was set, there was no going back, with the Bible or the Reformation.
</p>

<p>The next major Bible, and world, event was 40 years later. In 1455 <span style="font-variant: small-caps">AD</span> Gutenberg
invented the Printing Press, and the first book was his 2 volume Latin Bible.
</p>

<p>In 1516 Erasmus produced a parallel Greek / Latin Bible which was one of the
first scholarly tools, and may have helped Martin Luther produce the first German
NT, from The Greek (&amp; Hebrew) in 1522. This was the basis of Danish &amp; Swedish translations.
</p>

<p>In 1525-35 Tyndale produced his English NT, the first printed English Bible,
based mainly on the Greek. It did not have the shortcomings of Wycliffe, and was
a landmark in method&nbsp;and style. Tyndale was hunted by the establishment,
and burned at the stake in 1537, although not before the Myles Coverdale's Bible;
the
first complete printed Bible - published in 1535.
</p>

<p>Now, within a very short time, because of the political circumstances in
England, and the reformation on the continent, we move towards acceptance. 1537
saw the Thomas Matthew, a revision of Tyndale by John Rogers (80 Books), and
1539 saw the Taverners, a revision of Matthew minus most of the notes. But 1539
is a landmark as it saw the publishing of the Great Bible, or First Authorised
Version. With all 80 books it is often called the Cranmer after that archbishops preface to the 2nd edition.
</p>

<p>Work now gathered pace, as did the heat generated by the reformation. The
Geneva Bible (1560) was a revision of The Great. It was the first Study Bible,
with hardly flattering comments about the Catholic Church. It was written by reformers in exile in
Geneva,
and was supported by Calvin &amp; Knox. It was a full 80 Book Bible, based on
the Tyndale Bible, and remained popular for 100 years after the King James
Version, especially with Puritans in the United States. It was also notable as
the first Bible to have printed verse numbers.

<p>In 1568 the Bishop's Bible became the 2<sup>nd</sup> Authorised Bible, intended to
supersede the Great &amp; Geneva. 80 Books, translated by scholarly bishops.
</p>

<p>In 1582 Rome surrendered&nbsp; it's "Latin only" edict, and the preamble to
the greatest Bible of them all draws to a close. In 1609-10 the Douay/Rheimes
Bible was published, the first Catholic English translation (80 Books),
translated from the Vulgate (a disadvantage) it became the seed bible for nearly all Catholic Bibles.
However this important event was overshadowed the following year.
</p>

<p>In 1611 the King put his name to the King James, the 3<sup>rd</sup>
Authorised Version. Used by many to this day, and loathed by some as clinging
onto the past. The work was a masterpiece, the culmination of the 16<sup>th</sup>
 century work.
It took the best of what had gone before in style, prose, chapter &amp; verse&nbsp;division, and translation accuracy.
Written to be read out-loud in public worship, a literary and spiritual <i>giant leap</i>, which for it's day was breathtaking.
It was based on the Great Bible and on various TRs with Vulgate influence. It
reigned supreme until 1881.
</p>

<p>Some early printings are famous for a typographical error in Ruth 3:15. They
became known as the <i>He</i> bibles, rather than the correct <i>She</i> bibles,
and command a very high price today.

<p>The King James Bible set a standard which was not surpassed during the 17<sup>th</sup>
century. The fact there was little new activity during the rest of the century,
surely speaks volumes for the quality of the work of the KJV.
</p>

<p>
    New Testament editions in the 18<sup>th</sup> century did not question the Textus&nbsp;Receptus
(TR), despite new manuscript evidence and study, but its&nbsp;limitations became apparent. E. Wells, a British mathematician and&nbsp;theological writer (1719), was the first to edit a complete New Testament&nbsp;that abandoned the
TR in favour of more ancient manuscripts; and English scholar Richard Bentley (1720) also tried to go back to early manuscripts&nbsp;to restore an ancient text, but their work was ignored. In 1734
J.A. Bengel,&nbsp;a German Lutheran biblical theologian, stressed the idea that not only&nbsp;manuscripts but also families of manuscript traditions must be&nbsp;differentiated, and he initiated the formulation of criteria for text&nbsp;criticism.
</p>

<p>
    In 1782 Robert Aitken's Bible became the First English Language Bible (KJV without Apocrypha) to be
    printed in America.
</p>

<p>
    In 1833 Joseph Smith received his "Inspired Version" from God. It was published
    in 1867 after his death in 1866, and is considered divine by the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter Day Saints.
</p>

<p>
    In 1841 the English Hexapla New Testament was published. An Early Textual Comparison showing&nbsp;the Greek and 6 Famous English Translations in Parallel
    Columns, it demonstrated the need for study material for bible translators
    and scholars.
</p>

<p>
    The next major works took place between 1881-5, the Revised Version. Based on
    the KJV, it was a&nbsp; literal translation of Hebrew &amp; Greek by 65 English scholars.
    Full 80 Book, based on Masoretic 500 AD material. This became the <i>modern</i>
    bible of the 19<sup>th</sup> century against the King James version from the
    17<sup>th</sup>. It was also notable for its modern approach to translation
    rigour, and the team approach to the work.
</p>

<p>
    The story of the Apocrypha (or inter-testament works) is not covered here,
    however it was officially removed in 1885 leaving the 66 books generally
    accepted as the Word of God today.
</p>

<p>In 1901 the American Standard was published, an American version on the Revised / KJV
line, and in 1952 the Revised Standard Version, authorised by the NCC in the USA.
Whilst it has many good points, based on strong&nbsp;Greek originals, it is weak in its translation of key OT messianic passages.
