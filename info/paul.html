<h3>Apostle Paul's First Missionary Journey Map</h3>

<img src="paul1.jpg" alt="Apostle Paul's First Missionary Journey Map">     


<br><h3>Late Spring 44 A.D. to Fall 46 A.D.</h3><p class="justfy">In the late Spring of 44 A.D. the brethren (Acts 13:1 - 3) ordain <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/trivia/apostle-paul.html">Paul</a> and <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/apostlepaul/barnabas-to-gallio.html">Barnabas</a> as apostles. From Antioch, the two apostles and <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/beginner/john-to-mary.html">John (surnamed Mark)</a> begin Paul's first missionary journey (Acts 13:4 - 52, 14:1 - 25). </p><p class="justfy">Apostle Paul and company travel to Seleucia then sail to Salamis, the principle city and seaport of the island of Cyprus. <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/maps/new-testament-churches/cyprus.html">Cyprus</a> is where Barnabas was born and raised (Acts 4:36). In Salamis, they preach the gospel in several synagogues. They then cross the island by foot and arrive at Paphos.</p>
<h3>Thrown out of Antioch</h3><p class="justfy">In Antioch, the evangelists visit a local synagogue where the apostle preaches a powerful message (Acts 13:16 - 41). After the Jews leave the synagogue, the Gentiles (proselytes) in the audience ask him to speak the next Sabbath day. Then, after the dismissal of the synagogue, many Jews and proselytes follow him and Barnabas in order to hear more about the gospel. <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/godsrest/what-does-it-mean-to-keep-the-sabbath.html">On the next Sabbath</a>, almost the entire city comes to hear the word of God (Acts 13:42 - 44).</p><p class="justfy"><a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/question/how-do-jews-get-to-heaven.html">Some Jews</a>, however, envious of the large crowd drawn by apostle Paul, begin to speak against the gospel. Their rejection of Jesus as the Messiah means that he and Barnabas will now primarily preach only to Gentiles (Acts 13:45 - 47). </p><p class="justfy">As the word of the Lord spreads through the entire region, some Jews begin a campaign to convince important men and women of the city to be against him and Barnabas. Persecution soon sets in and culminates with both men expelled from the area.</p><div class="googpermbl">

</div><p class="justfy">Arriving in Iconium Paul speaks at <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/godsrest/synagogue-miracles-of-jesus.html">a local synagogue</a>. His preaching convinces many Jews and Greeks to become believers. Jews who do not believe in what he teaches, however, stir others up against the gospel. Although Paul performs <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/bible-study-by-topic/new-testament-miracles.html">signs and wonders</a> to confirm what he says, the city still wonders whether he and Barnabas are true servants of God. </p><p class="justfy">In a short time, some Jewish leaders, along with other Jews and Gentiles, conspire to have the two apostles stoned to death. After discovering a threat against their lives, the evangelists flee the city to Lystra (Acts 14:1 - 6).</p><h3>Worshipped like Greek gods</h3><p class="justfy">In Lystra Paul meets a man born crippled and never able to walk. He perceives, after the man hears his message, that he has enough faith for God to heal him. When Paul commands the crippled man to stand, he miraculously leaps up and is able to walk (Acts 14:6 - 10)! </p><div class="googpermbl">

</div><p class="justfy">The response to Paul's amazing miracle was immediate and unexpected. The two evangelists tear their clothes in amazement! They are barely able to keep the crowd from sacrificing to them <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/apostlepaul/life-epistles-of-apostle-paul/paul-worshipped-stoned.html">as if they were Greek gods</a> (Acts 14:14 - 18)!</p><h3>Surviving a stoning</h3><p class="justfy">In a short time, Jews from Pisidian Antioch and Iconium arrive in Lystra and succeed in turning people against the two evangelists. After being stoned, some people drag Paul's dead body out of the city. Some believers find his body and as they stand around it, <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/question/who-has-been-resurrected-from-the-dead.html">he comes back to life!</a> Amazingly, He re-enters the city.</p><p class="justfy">The next day Paul and <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/beginner/list-of-important-people-in-new-testament.html">Barnabas</a> travel to Derbe (Acts 14:19 - 20). They preach the gospel in Derbe then retrace their steps through Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch in order to strengthen the brethren. From Pisidian Antioch they travel to Perga and then to Attalia, where they catch a ship to sail back to where their missionary journey started (Acts 14:21 - 26).</p><h3>Fall 46 A.D. to Late Summer 49 A.D.</h3><p class="justfy">Paul and Barnabas stay in Antioch for almost three years, from the Fall of 46 A.D. to the late summer of 49 A.D. (Acts 14:26 - 28).</p>

</div><br><h3>Late Autumn 49 to Late Summer 50</h3><p class="justfy">Paul takes Silas with him to <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/biblepic/tarsus-birthplace-of-apostle-paul.html">Tarsus</a>. From there they travel to Derbe and Lystra. It is in Lystra that he meets <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/bible-study-by-topic/people-in-the-bible/timothy.html">Timothy</a>, who would become his frequent traveling companion, fellow laborer in spreading the gospel and his best friend (Acts 16:1; 1Timothy 1:2, 4:14).</p><p class="justfy">The apostle has Timothy circumcised (Acts 16:3). He then takes him and Silas to churches in the regions of <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/roman-empire/roman-provinces-in-new-testament/asia-galatia-bithynia.html">Galatia</a> (Iconium) and <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/roman-empire/roman-provinces-in-new-testament/introduction.html">Phrygia</a> (Antioch) to deliver the decision rendered at the Jerusalem conference.</p><p class="justfy">Paul, as he journeys to the northwest of Antioch, desires to <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/apostlepaul/life-epistles-of-apostle-paul/paul-led-to-troas.html">preach the gospel in western Asia</a>. God's spirit, however, forbids him to do so (Acts 16:6). The apostle and his group continues to travel north toward the region of Mysia. He wants to travel East to the province of Bithynia but again is forbidden to do so (Acts 16:7). Him and his companions then decide to go to the port city of Troas on <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/maps/area-of-apostle-paul-greatest-missionary-work.html">the Aegean Sea</a>. </p><div class="googpermbl">

</div><p class="justfy">It is in Troas that <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/beginner/john-to-mary.html">Luke</a>, the writer of the book of Acts, joins Paul and company. God then gives him a vision of a man in Macedonia (Greece) begging him for help (Acts 16:8 - 9). The group then  immediately boards a ship, which sails near the island of Samothrace (Samothracia), then arrives at Neapolis (Acts 16:10 - 11).</p><p class="justfy">From Neapolis the group goes to <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/biblepic/philippi-apostle-paul-missionary-journeys.html">Philippi</a>, where a woman named Lydia hears Paul's preaching. On Pentecost in 50 A.D. Lydia is baptized along with her entire household (Acts 16:12 - 15).</p><p class="justfy">Paul, while in Philippi, casts a demon out of a female slave (Acts 16:16 - 18). Her masters, however, angry that they have lost the ability to make more money from the slave's demonic divination, stir up the city against him and Silas. The two evangelists are arrested, beaten and put in prison (Acts 16:19 - 24). </p><p class="justfy">Soon after the evangelists arrive in jail <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/bible-study-by-topic/new-testament-miracles.html">a miraculous earthquake</a> causes all the cell doors to open and the bonds of all prisoners to be loosed. This event leads to the conversion of the prison guard.</p><div class="googpermbl">

</div><p class="justfy">A freed Paul and Silas, along with Timothy and Luke, travel through the cities of Amphipolis and Apollonia and arrive in <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/apostlepaul/life-epistles-of-apostle-paul/journey-to-thessalonica.html">Thessalonica</a> (Acts 17:1). In Thessalonica Paul visits a Jewish synagogue and for three consecutive Sabbaths (Saturdays) explains why Jesus is the Old Testament prophesied Savior of Mankind (Acts 17:2 - 4).</p><p class="justfy">Although many believe what is said certain Jews, envious of the Gospel's success, form a mob and start a riot (Acts 17:4 - 5). The riotous crowd go to the house of Jason seeking him and Silas. When they are not found, the crowd drags <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/apostlepaul/gamaliel-to-lucius.html">Jason</a> and some brethren to the local civil magistrates and accuses them of wrongdoing (Acts 17:5 - 8). In a short time, however, Jason and the brethren are let go.</p><p class="justfy">Paul and Silas preach in a synagogue in Berea. <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/apostlepaul/life-epistles-of-apostle-paul/visiting-berea.html">The Bereans</a> are not only willing to listen to what they have to say they also verify what is preached against the Old Testament scriptures (Acts 17:11 - 12). Many Bereans come to believe the Gospel. Unfortunately, Jews from Thessalonica arrive in the city seeking to cause more trouble for him (Acts 17:13). </p><p class="justfy">Paul immediately leaves for the coast and sets sail for <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/apostlepaul/life-epistles-of-apostle-paul/visit-to-athens.html">Athens</a> while the rest of his party stay in Berea (Acts 17:14). In Athens he requests Timothy and Silas come to the city (Acts 17:15).</p>
<div class="googpermbl">
</div><p class="justfy">While waiting in Athens for his traveling companions Paul preaches the Gospel to any Athenian who would listen. Some who hear his message are Jews and devout people. Others are Epicureans (followers of Epicurus) who believe the highest aim of man is to seek a pleasant life while other are Stoics. The Stoics believe that man's happiness consists of bringing himself into harmony with the universe. </p><p class="justfy">After hearing some of Paul's message the Epicureans and Stoics take him to the Areopagus (or Mars Hill as the Romans call it) to further explain what he teaches (Acts 17:16 - 19).</p><p class="justfy">On Mars Hill Paul uses an altar he saw dedicated to &quot;an unknown god&quot; as a springboard for teaching the crowd about the real God that can be known (Acts 17:19, 22 - 23).</p><h3>Late Summer 50  to Autumn 52 A.D.</h3><p class="justfy">Paul leaves Athens and <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/apostlepaul/life-epistles-of-apostle-paul/corinth.html">travels to Corinth</a>. It is in Corinth that he first meets <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/apostlepaul/peter-to-sergius-paulus.html">Priscilla and Aquila</a>. Since both he and the couple make a living as tentmakers he stays at their house. He preaches the gospel every Sabbath in the synagogue. Silas and Timothy join him in Corinth. (Acts 18:1 - 5). The synagogue eventually splits and a new church is formed. After the split he stays and teaches in Corinth for a year and a half.</p><div class="googpermbl">

</div><p class="justfy">In the winter of 51 A.D. <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/apostlepaul/life-epistles-of-apostle-paul/jews-versus-paul.html">Paul is brought before the judgment seat of Gallio</a> (Acts 18:12 - 18) and is released. He remains in Corinth until the Spring of 52 A.D. when he then travels to the port city of Cenchrea. In the city he has his head shaved due to a vow he took (Acts 18:18). He soon boards a ship and travels to Ephesus with Priscilla and Aquila.</p><p class="justfy">In Ephesus Paul preaches in a synagogue but soon leaves the couple behind so that he can be in Jerusalem to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles (Acts 18:19 - 21). He sails from Ephesus to Caesarea, then travels to Jerusalem. After keeping the Feast he returns to Antioch (Acts 18:21 - 22).</p></div>

<h3>Apostle Paul's Third Missionary Journey Map</h3>
<img src="paul3.jpg" alt="Apostle Paul's Third Missionary Journey Map">     

<br><a href="apostle-paul-third-missionary-journey-large-map.html">View larger image</a></div><br><h3>Autumn 52 A.D. to Summer 53 A.D.</h3><p class="justfy"><a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/trivia/apostle-paul.html">Paul</a> stays in Antioch from the Autumn of 52 A.D. to the Summer of 53 A.D. (Acts 18:23). Peter visits Antioch during the Spring Holy Day season. While celebrating <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/bibleref/holy-days/passover-and-feast-of-unleavened-bread.html">the Feast of Unleavened Bread</a> Peter does not have a problem with eating or fellowshipping with uncircumcised Gentile converts. During the Feast some Jewish converts from Jerusalem arrive. These converts still believe all Christians (e.g. the Gentiles) <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/apostlepaul/life-epistles-of-apostle-paul/controversies-in-the-early-church.html">should also be circumcised</a> in order to receive salvation.</p><p class="justfy">As Apostle Paul relates in the book of Galatians, Peter (and <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/apostlepaul/barnabas-to-gallio.html">Barnabas</a>) treat the Gentile converts quite differently when the Jewish converts arrive. Their behavior, according to him,<a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/apostlepaul/life-epistles-of-apostle-paul/paul-confronts-peter.html"> deserved a public rebuke</a>.</p><h3>Summer 53 A.D.</h3><p class="justfy">Paul's third evangelistic tour begins by revisiting <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/roman-empire/roman-provinces-in-new-testament/asia-galatia-bithynia.html">the churches in Galatia</a> in order to follow-up on the epistle he wrote to them in late spring (book of Galatians). He then visits brethren in the Phrygia province to strengthen them in their walk as Christians (Acts 18:23).</p>

</div><br><h3>Autumn 54 A.D. to Early Winter 57</h3><p class="justfy">Paul, from the Phrygia region, journeys to <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/biblepic/ephesus-apostle-paul-missionary-journeys.html">Ephesus</a> and stays in the city for a little more than three years (Acts 19:1 - 20). In the late winter of 56 A.D., while at Ephesus, he writes the book of 1Corinthians. He writes his second epistle to <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/biblepic/corinth-apostle-paul-missionary-journeys.html">the Corinthians</a> in late summer of 57 A.D. </p><p class="justfy">While in Ephesus he discovers twelve believers who were baptized as a sign of repentance by <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/question/john-the-baptist-doubts-jesus.html">John the Baptist</a> but who DID NOT as yet have God's spirit. He tells the disciples about Jesus and baptizes them in His name. Upon baptism they immediately receive God's Holy Spirit (Acts 19:1 - 7).</p><p class="justfy">Paul preaches boldly about the Gospel for three months in a local synagogue. Some, however, who do not believe what he teaches begin to speak evil of God's way. Paul and those who believe the Gospel leave the synagogue (Acts 19:8 - 10).</p><p class="justfy">One day seven sons of a Jewish priest named Sceva arrive in Ephesus. The sons are Jewish exorcists who travel from place to place and <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/apostlepaul/life-epistles-of-apostle-paul/paul-at-ephesus.html">pretend to cast demons</a> out of people. They witness Paul casting out demons and decide to try his method for themselves. They run into someone possessed of an evil spirit and attempt to cast it out of the person. The response they receive is totally unexpected!</p><div class="googpermbl">

</div><p class="justfy">What happens next to the seven sons serves as a warning to anyone who assume to have the authority of God to command powerful evil spirits. As the sons learn, merely using the name of Jesus does not guarantee the ability to access His power (Acts 19:13 - 17).</p><p class="justfy">After what happened to the sons of Sceva many who practiced magic repented of their deeds and burned their books of spells and other evil-related practices (Acts 19:18 - 19).</p><h3>Early Winter 57</h3><p class="justfy">In the early winter of 57 A.D. an Ephesian silversmith named Demetrius, who makes a significant profit creating small replicas of <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/apostlepaul/life-epistles-of-apostle-paul/paul-versus-pagans.html">the pagan goddess Diana and her temple</a>, becomes concerned about a recent loss of business (Acts 19:24 - 27)</p><p class="justfy">The preaching of Paul in the area has persuaded many people to stop purchasing and using idols, and to abandon altogether the worship of false gods like Diana. The goddess Diana is zealously worshipped in Ephesus and in other places around the empire.</p><div class="googpermbl">

</div><p class="justfy">The city of Ephesus is famous for possessing the Temple of Diana (Artemis), which in modern times is considered <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/apostlepaul/life-epistles-of-apostle-paul/wonder-of-ancient-world.html">one of the seven wonders</a> of the ancient world. Demetrius <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/bible-study-by-topic/silver-in-the-bible.html">the silversmith</a> organizes a meeting of fellow tradesmen to discuss the drop in idol sales.</p><p class="justfy">During the meeting a riot breaks out. The crowd finds and seizes two of Paul's traveling companions. When Paul wants to talk to the mob some disciples stop him from doing so and jeopardizing his life (Acts 19:28 - 31). The riot is eventually quieted by a city clerk (Acts 19:32 - 40).</p><p class="justfy">The worship of Diana is so well-known and universally accepted that, according to the clerk, there was no danger of it being destroyed by the evangelist and what he taught. The clerk chides the crowd for their unreasonable fears and warns them there are consequences if they continue being disorderly! The riot soon disperses. </p><p class="justfy"><a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/apostlepaul/life-epistles-of-apostle-paul/revisiting-new-churches.html">Paul leaves Ephesus</a> and journeys to Macedonia. During his three month stay in the region he visits <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/apostlepaul/life-epistles-of-apostle-paul/second-visit-to-corinth.html">Corinth</a> (Acts 20:1 - 3) and writes his letter to the Romans.</p><div class="googpermbl">

</div><br><h3>58 A.D.</h3><p class="justfy">The apostle Paul and company travel back through Macedonia to <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/biblepic/troas-apostle-paul-missionary-journeys.html">Troas</a>, where they keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread (Acts 20:6). On his last day at Troas he preaches and teaches until late in the night. Listening to him is a young man sitting in a window. The man soon <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/apostlepaul/life-epistles-of-apostle-paul/paul-resurrects-dead.html">goes into a deep sleep and dies</a> when he falls from the window to the street below. The evangelist immediately goes to the young man, embraces him, and <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/question/who-has-been-resurrected-from-the-dead.html">he comes back to life</a> (Acts 20:7 - 11)!</p><p class="justfy">After the Feast Luke and a few others sail from Philippi and meet Paul in Troas. Although <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/apostlepaul/luke-to-persis.html">Luke</a> and several others decide to sail from Troas to <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/biblepic/assos-apostle-paul-missionary-journeys.html">Assos</a>, Paul chooses to walk to the city (Acts 20:13 - 14). </p><p class="justfy">In Assos the entire group takes a ship to Mitylene (Acts 20:14). From Mitylene they sail past the islands of Chios and Samos, dock for a night at Trogyllium, then eventually arrive at Miletus (Acts 20:15).</p><div class="googpermbl">

</div><p class="justfy">From Miletus the apostle requests that the elders in the Ephesian church visit him. When they arrive <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/apostlepaul/life-epistles-of-apostle-paul/warning-to-the-church.html">he warns them</a> about the coming apostasy in the church (Acts 20:26-31).</p><p class="justfy"><a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/apostlepaul/life-epistles-of-apostle-paul/paul-sails-to-jerusalem.html">Paul soon boards a ship</a> in Miletus. His vessel sails to the islands of Cos and Rhodes but only to dock briefly off their coasts. He eventually arrives at Patara, where he boards another boat bound for the city of Tyre in Phoenicia (Acts 21:1 - 4). Landing at <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/apostlepaul/life-epistles-of-apostle-paul/paul-arrives-in-tyre.html">Tyre</a> he stays will fellow believers in the area for one week (Acts 21:5 - 6). </p><p class="justfy">From Tyre Paul sails to Ptolemais where his visits some brethren for a day. He again boards a boat and arrives at Caesarea. <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/apostlepaul/peter-to-sergius-paulus.html">Philip the evangelist</a>, who lives in Caesarea, has him stay in his home for many days (Acts 21:8,10). While at Philip's house a prophet from Judea named Agabus comes to see him. He takes his belt, binds his own hands and feet, and gives a prophecy of Paul's capture (Acts 21:11).</p><p class="justfy">Although those with him plead with him not to go to Jerusalem he decides to go anyway (Acts 21:12 - 15).</p> <h3>Late Spring 58 A.D.</h3><p class="justfy">Paul arrives in Jerusalem around the late spring of 58 A.D., possibly near the time of <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/bibleref/holy-days/message-of-pentecost.html">the Feast of Pentecost</a> (Acts 21:17).</p></div>

<h3>Apostle Paul's Fourth Missionary Journey Map</h3>

<br><a href="apostle-paul-fourth-missionary-journey-large-map.html">View larger image</a></div><br><h3>Late Spring 58 A.D.</h3><p class="justfy"><a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/beginner/learn-basic-bible-timeline/life-of-apostle-paul.html">Paul</a>'s desire was to arrive in Jerusalem to celebrate the Feast of Pentecost on May 21 of 58 A.D. (Acts 20:16). He desired is fulfilled when he arrives in the city  (Acts 21:17). <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/apostlepaul/life-epistles-of-apostle-paul/final-visit-to-jerusalem.html">Arriving in Jerusalem</a> he visits James and soon afterwards goes to the temple with four Jewish converts. Jews from Asia, who hate Paul, see him at the temple and very loudly accuse him of wrongdoing (Acts 21:17 - 28).</p><p class="justfy">A riot soon erupts. The mob seizes Paul, drags him <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/apostlepaul/life-epistles-of-apostle-paul/description-of-temple.html">out of the temple</a>, and begins to beat him. The Romans quickly find out what is happening and dispatch troops to the temple area. Those beating him stop doing so when Roman soldiers arrive at the scene (Acts 21:30 - 32). </p><p class="justfy">The Romans bind Paul and begin to escort him to some nearby barracks. As he is led away he requests and is given permission to speak to the people (Acts 21:33 - 40).</p>


</div><p class="justfy">Paul's speech to the mob (Acts 22:1 - 21), through sincere, only fans the flames of resentment against him. The crowd begins to call for his death and the riot increases in intensity. He is led away to the Roman barracks where they want to scourge him to find out why the people rioted against him. Just before his scourging he tells a Roman centurion that he is <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/roman-empire/how-difficult-was-it-to-obtain-roman-citizenship.html">a Roman citizen</a>.</p><p class="justfy">When the commander finds out what Paul told the centurion he personally verifies his citizenship status as a Roman. After confirming that he is indeed a Roman citizen the commander immediately cancels the scourging (Acts 22:25 - 29).</p><p class="justfy">The next day the apostle is released from his bonds and brought before <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/beginner/new-testament-groups/sanhedrin.html">the Sanhedrin</a> to have them determine what caused the tumult in the temple (Acts 22:30). His defense before the <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/beginner/new-testament-groups/overview.html">Jewish religious leaders</a> accomplishes little (Acts 23:1 - 10). The night after his hearing he has a vision of Jesus, standing next to him, assuring him he will make it to Rome (Acts 23:11).</p><div class="googpermbl">

</div><p class="justfy">When daybreak arrives some forty zealous Jews band together and swear an oath that they will not eat or drink <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/apostlepaul/life-epistles-of-apostle-paul/death-threat-and-escape.html">until Paul is killed</a>. They conspire with the chief priests and elders to have him murdered as he travels to meet with them a second time. <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/apostlepaul/apostle-paul-relatives.html">Paul's sister's son</a> hears about the plot against his uncle and informs the Romans (Acts 23:12 - 22).</p><p class="justfy">Paul is soon escorted out of the city, at night, by two hundred (200) Roman soldiers (Acts 23:23 - 24) who will take him through Antipatris to <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/biblepic/caesarea-apostle-paul-missionary-journeys.html">Caesarea</a> where his case can be heard. When he arrives in Caesarea governor Felix decides to keep him in the Praetorium of Herod (Acts 23:35).</p><h3>Early Summer 58 to Early Autumn 60</h3><p class="justfy">Paul is <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/question/how-long-was-apostle-paul-in-prison.html">a Roman prisoner</a> in Caesarea from early Summer 58 A.D. to early Autumn 60 A.D. In Caesarea he defends himself several times while he is a prisoner (Acts 24). He is found to have done nothing worthy of bonds or death. <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/apostlepaul/barnabas-to-gallio.html">Governor Felix</a>, in spite of his innocence, keeps him a Roman prisoner in the hope that a bribe will be offered to secure his release (Acts 24:26 - 27). </p><div class="googpermbl">

</div><p class="justfy">Felix, to facilitate the possibility of a bribe for Paul's release,  gives him liberties such as not being bound and the right to have people visit and provide for his needs. In two years Felix, the Roman governor of Judea, is replaced by <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/apostlepaul/barnabas-to-gallio.html">Porcius Festus</a>.</p><p class="justfy">Governor Festus hears the accusations against the apostle made by several Jews from Jerusalem, none of which can be proved (Acts 25:6 - 8). Festus, wanting to garner favor from the Jews, asks him if he is willing to have his case officially tried by him in Jerusalem. Paul, as a Roman citizen, requests his case be heard by <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/biblepic/cleopatra.html">Caesar</a> in Rome.</p><p class="justfy">Festus agrees to send him to Rome. King Agrippa and his wife arrive in Caesarea and <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/apostlepaul/life-epistles-of-apostle-paul/paul-preaches-to-royalty.html">allow Paul to defend himself</a> against the charges laid against him (Acts 25:13 - 26:29). Not only does Agrippa find that he has done nothing worthy of imprisonment or death (Acts 26:30 - 31) but that Paul might have been freed if he had not appealed his case to Caesar (Acts 26:32).</p><div class="googpermbl">

</div><br><h3>Autumn 60 A.D. to Early Spring 61 A.D.</h3><p class="justfy">In the Autumn of 60 A.D. Paul, along with several other prisoners, boards a boat bound for Rome. His travel to <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/biblepic/origin-of-rome.html">Rome</a> is considered his fourth evangelistic journey.</p><p class="justfy">The prisoners are escorted to Rome by a Roman Centurion named <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/apostlepaul/gamaliel-to-lucius.html">Julius</a> (Acts 27:1 - 2). From Caesarea they set sail and soon arrive at <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/apostlepaul/sidon.html">Sidon</a>. From Sidon the ship hugs the coast near Antioch and the Roman provinces of Cilicia and Pamphylia before arriving at Myra. </p><p class="justfy">In Myra the people board a ship bound for Italy. Because of the wind, however, the ship is unable to sail directly to Italy. Instead, the ship hugs the coast until it arrives near Cnidus, where it turns south toward <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/maps/new-testament-churches/introduction.html">the island of Crete</a> (Acts 27:3 - 7).</p><p class="justfy">After a difficult journey the ship anchors at the Cretan city of Fair Havens. Although Paul warns Julius not to sail <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/maps/area-of-apostle-paul-greatest-missionary-work.html">the Mediterranean</a> during this dangerous time of the year (September to October), the Centurion disregards his advice and has the ship set sail for the western part of the island and the harbor of Phoenix (Acts 27:9 - 12).</p><div class="googpermbl">

</div><p class="justfy">The ship soon encounters a fierce storm <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/apostlepaul/life-epistles-of-apostle-paul/paul-is-lost-at-sea.html">which drives it out to sea</a>. Storms, strong winds and overcast skies which hide the sun and moon cause the ship to lose control and be aimlessly tossed at sea for about two weeks (Acts 27:13 - 27). Eventually the ship drifts near <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/apostlepaul/malta.html">the island of Malta</a> where it is run aground.</p><p class="justfy">All two hundred and seventy-six people on the boat abandon ship. They grab whatever parts of floating wreckage they can <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/apostlepaul/life-epistles-of-apostle-paul/paul-is-shipwrecked.html">from the shipwreck</a> and make their way to the island (Acts 27:37 - 44). All those on the ship arrive safely on Malta, fulfilling God's promise that no life would be lost (Acts 27:22 - 25).</p><p class="justfy">Paul stays three months on Malta where he is treated kindly by the natives. In his short stay on the island he miraculously survives a bite from a poisonous viper, <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/apostlepaul/life-epistles-of-apostle-paul/miracles-on-malta.html">heals the father of the island's governor</a>, then heals the diseases of those on the island (Acts 28:1 - 10). </p><p class="justfy">Paul soon, however,  boards a ship wintering at the island and set sail to Syracuse and Rhegium. They eventually arrives at the Italian port city of Puteoli, where he stays for one week with Christians in the area (Acts 28:11 - 14). He is then taken to Rome on the well-known <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/biblepic/the-appian-way.html">Appian Way road</a> (Acts 28:14 - 16).</p><div class="googpermbl">

</div><br><h3>Early Spring 61 to Early Spring 63</h3><p class="justfy">The apostle is a prisoner in Rome for two years (Acts 28:30). Although Paul is a prisoner, he is allowed  to live by himself guarded only by a Roman soldier (Acts 28:16). Shortly after his arrival in the city he speaks with <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/beginner/new-testament-groups/overview.html">Jewish religious leaders</a> regarding his arrest (Acts 28:17 - 29). During his imprisonment He is  given the privilage of being able to receive visitors and continue to preach the Gospel (Acts 28:17 - 31).</p></div>

<h3>Apostle Paul's Final Missionary Journey Map</h3>
<img src="paul5.jpg" alt="Apostle Paul's Final Missionary Journey Map">     

<h3>63 A.D.</h3><p class="justfy">In the Spring of the year, in Rome, <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/apostlepaul/when-were-books-by-apostle-paul-written.html">the apostle Paul</a> is acquitted of the charges against him and is set free. He sails from Rome to the island of Crete in order to meet with Titus (Titus 1:5). He then leaves <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/apostlepaul/silas-to-zenas.html">Titus</a> in Crete and sails to Nicopolis (Titus 1:5, 3:12). From Nicopolis he writes the New Testament books of 1Timothy and Titus.</p> <h3>63 A.D. to 67 A.D.</h3><p class="justfy">Paul continues his mission of spreading the gospel by traveling to Spain. In the winter of 57 A.D. He writes to the church at Rome regarding his planned travel to this western part of the empire.</p>

</div><blockquote><p class="justfy">For this reason also, I have been hindered many times from coming to you (the believers in Rome Paul had never visited). But now, there being no place in these regions that has not heard the gospel, and having a great desire to come to you for many years whenever I may go to Spain, I will come to you because I hope to see you while passing through Rome . . .</p><p class="justfy">Therefore, when I have finished this task (delivering aid to <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/basicart/what-does-bible-say-about-poor.html">poor saints in Jerusalem</a>), and have safely delivered into their hands the fruit that was collected, I will set off toward Spain and will come to you (Romans 15:22 - 24, 28, HBFV).</p></blockquote><p class="justfy">There is also evidence, though not conclusive, that Paul also preached the gospel in Britain (Britannia).</p><div class="googpermbl">

</div><br><h3>67 A.D.</h3><p class="justfy">Paul is back in a prison in Rome. While prisoner he writes his last book which is addressed to his best friend <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/bible-study-by-topic/people-in-the-bible/timothy.html">Timothy</a>.</p><h3>68 A.D.</h3><p class="justfy">Paul is beheaded, under Roman Emperor Nero, around May or June. <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/question/sauldie.html">His death</a> occurs just before Nero's suicide on June 9, 68 A.D. in Greece. He is about 66 years old.</p><p class="justfy">Nero is the first emperor of <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/maps/roman-empire.html">the Roman Empire</a> to actively persecute and kill Christians. Rome will carry out at least TEN major efforts to exterminate Christians and expunge Christianity from the empire. The persecutions first start under Nero in 67 A.D. and <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/maps/map-of-roman-empire-under-diocletian-constantine.html">continue until 313</a>.</p><p class="justfy">Paul's impact on Christianity will be enormous. During his ministry he wrote fourteen books of the Bible and carried out no less than five missionary journeys. He paid a price, however, for his strong devotion to God and the truth by spending a total of five of his ministry years in prison. He remained faithful to the very end of his life.</p></div>
