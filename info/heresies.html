<div class="mw-parser-output"><p><a href="/wiki/Heresy" title="Heresy">Heresy</a> is the rejection of one or more established beliefs of a religious body, or adherence to "other beliefs."  <b>Christian heresy</b> refers to unorthodox beliefs and practices that were deemed to be heretical by one or more of the Christian churches.  This list identifies beliefs and practices that have been categorized to one time or another as <a href="/wiki/Christian_heresy" title="Christian heresy">heretical</a> by one or more Christian groups.
</p><p>The term "heresy" most commonly refers to those beliefs which were declared to be <a href="/wiki/Anathema" title="Anathema">anathema</a> by the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church" class="mw-redirect" title="Roman Catholic Church">Catholic Church</a> prior to the <a href="/wiki/East-West_Schism" title="East-West Schism">schism of 1054</a>. After the schism, both the Catholic Church and the <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church" class="mw-redirect" title="Eastern Orthodox Church">Orthodox Church</a> continued to use the term to identify what it considered to be unorthodox beliefs and practices. While individual <a href="/wiki/Protestantism" title="Protestantism">Protestant</a> churches have also used the concept in proceedings against individuals and groups deemed to be heretical by those churches, the lack of a central doctrinal authority has meant that no belief or practice can be officially pronounced to be a heresy from the Protestant perspective.

<p>Traditionally, <a href="/wiki/Orthodoxy" title="Orthodoxy">orthodoxy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Heresy" title="Heresy">heresy</a> have been viewed in relation to the "orthodoxy" as an authentic lineage of tradition. Other forms of Christianity were viewed as deviant streams of thought and therefore "<a href="/wiki/Heterodox" class="mw-redirect" title="Heterodox">heterodox</a>", or heretical. This view was dominant until the publication of <a class="new" title="Walter Bauer (page does not exist)" data-uncrawlable-url="L3dpa2kvV2FsdGVyX0JhdWVyP2FjdGlvbj1lZGl0JnJlZGxpbms9MQ==" rel="nofollow">Walter Bauer</a>'s <i>Rechtgläubigkeit und Ketzerei im ältesten Christentum</i> ("Orthodoxy and heresy in ancient Christianity") in 1934. Bauer endeavored to rethink early Christianity historically, independent from the views of the church. He stated that the early church was very diverse and included many "heretical" groups that had an equal claim to apostolic tradition. Bauer interpreted the struggle between the orthodox and heterodox to be the "mainstream" Roman church struggling to attain dominance. He presented <a href="/wiki/Edessa,_Mesopotamia" title="Edessa, Mesopotamia">Edessa</a> and <a href="/wiki/Egypt" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> as places where the "orthodoxy" of Rome had little influence during the second century. As he saw it, the theological thought of the Orient at the time would later be labeled "heresy". The response by modern scholars has been mixed. Some scholars clearly support Bauer's conclusions and others express concerns about his possible bias. More moderate responses have become prominent and Bauer's theory is generally accepted. However, modern scholars have critiqued and updated Bauer's model.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>

<li>The state of perfection, freedom from the world and passion, is therefore attained solely by prayer, not through the church, baptism and or any of the sacraments, which have no effect on the passions or the influence of evil on the soul (hence the name, "Euchites", which means "Those who pray").</li></ol>

Although this study of the inter-relationship of these two natures is the foundation of Christology, some essential sub-topics within the field of Christology include:
</p>
<ul><li>the <a class="new" title="Incarnation (Christianity) (page does not exist)" data-uncrawlable-url="L3dpa2kvSW5jYXJuYXRpb25fKENocmlzdGlhbml0eSk/YWN0aW9uPWVkaXQmcmVkbGluaz0x" rel="nofollow">Incarnation</a>,</li>

<li>and the salvific work of Jesus (known as <a href="/wiki/Soteriology" title="Soteriology">soteriology</a>).</li></ul>
<p>Christology is related to questions concerning the nature of God like the <a href="/wiki/Trinity" title="Trinity">Trinity</a>, <a href="/wiki/Unitarianism" title="Unitarianism">Unitarianism</a> or <a class="new" title="Binitarianism (page does not exist)" data-uncrawlable-url="L3dpa2kvQmluaXRhcmlhbmlzbT9hY3Rpb249ZWRpdCZyZWRsaW5rPTE=" rel="nofollow">Binitarianism</a>. However, from a Christian perspective, these questions are concerned with how the divine persons relate to one another, whereas Christology is concerned with the meeting of the human (<a href="/wiki/Son_of_Man" title="Son of Man">Son of Man</a>) and divine (<a href="/wiki/God_the_Son" title="God the Son">God the Son</a>) in the person of <a href="/wiki/Jesus" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>.
</p><p>Throughout the <a href="/wiki/History_of_Christianity" title="History of Christianity">history of Christianity</a>, Christological questions have been very important in the life of the Church. Christology was a fundamental concern from the <a href="/wiki/First_Council_of_Nicaea" title="First Council of Nicaea">First Council of Nicaea</a> (325) until the <a href="/wiki/Third_Council_of_Constantinople" title="Third Council of Constantinople">Third Council of Constantinople</a> (680).  In this time period, the Christological views of various groups within the broader Christian community led to accusations of <a href="/wiki/Christian_heresy" title="Christian heresy">heresy</a>, and, infrequently, subsequent <a class="new" title="Religious persecution (page does not exist)" data-uncrawlable-url="L3dpa2kvUmVsaWdpb3VzX3BlcnNlY3V0aW9uP2FjdGlvbj1lZGl0JnJlZGxpbms9MQ==" rel="nofollow">religious persecution</a>. In some cases, a sect's unique Christology is its chief distinctive feature; in these cases it is common for the sect to be known by the name given to its Christology.
</p><p>The orthodox teaching, as it developed, is that Christ was fully divine and at the same time fully human, and that the three persons of the <a href="/wiki/Trinity" title="Trinity">Trinity</a> are co-equal and co-eternal.  This position was challenged in the fourth century by <a href="/wiki/Arius" title="Arius">Arius</a>.  <a href="/wiki/Arianism" title="Arianism">Arianism</a> held that Jesus, while not merely mortal, was not eternally divine and was, therefore, of lesser status than <a href="/wiki/God_the_Father" title="God the Father">God the Father</a> (<span class="plainlinks"><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://tools.wmflabs.org/bibleversefinder/?book=%20John&amp;verse=14:28&amp;src=!">John 14:28</a></span>). <a href="/wiki/Trinitarianism" class="mw-redirect" title="Trinitarianism">Trinitarianism</a> held that God the Father, <a href="/wiki/God_the_Son" title="God the Son">God the Son</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Holy_Spirit" title="Holy Spirit">Holy Spirit</a> were all strictly one being with three <a class="new" title="Hypostasis (Christianity) (page does not exist)" data-uncrawlable-url="L3dpa2kvSHlwb3N0YXNpc18oQ2hyaXN0aWFuaXR5KT9hY3Rpb249ZWRpdCZyZWRsaW5rPTE=" rel="nofollow">hypostases</a>. Many groups held <a href="/wiki/Dualism" title="Dualism">dualistic beliefs</a>, maintaining that reality was composed into two radically opposing parts: matter, usually seen as evil, and spirit, seen as good.  Others held that both the material and spiritual worlds were created by God and were therefore both good, and that this was represented in the unified divine and human natures of Christ.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup>

<td>The principle of nationalities applied in the ecclesiastical domain: in other words, the confusion between Church and nation. The term ethnophyletismos designates the idea that a local autocephalous Church should be based not on a local [ecclesial] criterion, but on an ethnophyletist, national or linguistic one.</td>
<td>Phyletism was condemned in 1872,  at the pan-Orthodox Synod in Constantinople as a modern ecclesial heresy: the Church should not be confused with the destiny of a single nation or a single race.<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup>
</td>
<td>Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew has declared that “nationalism remains one of the central problems of the Church."  Phyletism has been a threat to Orthodox unity since at least the rise of nationalism in the 19th century, and its impact on Orthodoxy in America – and in other areas of the so-called “diaspora” throughout the 20th century and to the present-day is well known.<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup>
<p>The conditions behind modern-day phyletism are different from those surrounding the 1872 decision of the Synod of Constantinople.  In the latter half of the 20th century, there has been a vigorous and sometimes contentious debate among the Orthodox concerning the problem of the Diaspora, specifically the organization of the Orthodox Church in countries to which Orthodox have emigrated, particularly since the Russian Revolution. The problem is that Orthodox dioceses (officially called "jurisdictions) in the Diaspora are superimposed on each other. The result is that there are usually several Orthodox bishops of different Orthodox churches in Diaspora cities. This situation violates the canonical principle of territoriality – that each city and province should have its own unique bishop.
