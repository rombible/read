<div class="chap"><p class="heading">A Life Pleasing to God</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Finally, then, brothers,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or brothers and sisters; also verses 10, 13">a</a></sup></span> we ask and urge you in the Lord Jesus, that as you received from us how you ought to walk and to please God, just as you are doing, that you do so more and more.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>For you know what instructions we gave you through the Lord Jesus.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For this is the will of God, your sanctification:<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or your holiness">b</a></sup></span> that you abstain from sexual immorality;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>that each one of you know how to control his own body<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or how to take a wife for himself; Greek how to possess his own vessel">c</a></sup></span> in holiness and honor,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>not in the passion of lust like the Gentiles who do not know God;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>that no one transgress and wrong his brother in this matter, because the Lord is an avenger in all these things, as we told you beforehand and solemnly warned you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For God has not called us for impurity, but in holiness.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Therefore whoever disregards this, disregards not man but God, who gives his Holy Spirit to you.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Now concerning brotherly love you have no need for anyone to write to you, for you yourselves have been taught by God to love one another,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>for that indeed is what you are doing to all the brothers throughout Macedonia. But we urge you, brothers, to do this more and more,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>and to aspire to live quietly, and to mind your own affairs, and to work with your hands, as we instructed you,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>so that you may walk properly before outsiders and be dependent on no one.</p>
<p class="heading">The Coming of the Lord</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>But we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about those who are asleep, that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, through Jesus, God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>For this we declare to you by a word from the Lord,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or by the word of the Lord">d</a></sup></span> that we who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command, with the voice of an archangel, and with the sound of the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord.
