<div class="chap"><p class="heading">The Day of the Lord</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Now concerning the times and the seasons, brothers,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or brothers and sisters; also verses 4, 12, 14, 25, 26, 27">a</a></sup></span> you have no need to have anything written to you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>For you yourselves are fully aware that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>While people are saying, &#8220;There is peace and security,&#8221; then sudden destruction will come upon them as labor pains come upon a pregnant woman, and they will not escape.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But you are not in darkness, brothers, for that day to surprise you like a thief.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For you are all children<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or sons; twice in this verse">b</a></sup></span> of light, children of the day. We are not of the night or of the darkness.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So then let us not sleep, as others do, but let us keep awake and be sober.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, are drunk at night.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, having put on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet the hope of salvation.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For God has not destined us for wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>who died for us so that whether we are awake or asleep we might live with him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Therefore encourage one another and build one another up, just as you are doing.</p>
<p class="heading">Final Instructions and Benediction</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>We ask you, brothers, to respect those who labor among you and are over you in the Lord and admonish you,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>and to esteem them very highly in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>See that no one repays anyone evil for evil, but always seek to do good to one another and to everyone.
