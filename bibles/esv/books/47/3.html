<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Ministers of the New Covenant</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, as some do, letters of recommendation to you, or from you?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>You yourselves are our letter of recommendation, written on our<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts your">a</a></sup></span> hearts, to be known and read by all.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And you show that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek fleshly hearts">b</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Such is the confidence that we have through Christ toward God.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Not that we are sufficient in ourselves to claim anything as coming from us, but our sufficiency is from God,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>who has made us sufficient to be ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now if the ministry of death, carved in letters on stone, came with such glory that the Israelites could not gaze at Moses&#8217; face because of its glory, which was being brought to an end,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>will not the ministry of the Spirit have even more glory?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For if there was glory in the ministry of condemnation, the ministry of righteousness must far exceed it in glory.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Indeed, in this case, what once had glory has come to have no glory at all, because of the glory that surpasses it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For if what was being brought to an end came with glory, much more will what is permanent have glory.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Since we have such a hope, we are very bold,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>not like Moses, who would put a veil over his face so that the Israelites might not gaze at the outcome of what was being brought to an end.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But their minds were hardened. For to this day, when they read the old covenant, that same veil remains unlifted, because only through Christ is it taken away.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Yes, to this day whenever Moses is read a veil lies over their hearts.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But when one<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek he">c</a></sup></span> turns to the Lord, the veil is removed.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Now the Lord<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or this Lord">d</a></sup></span> is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
