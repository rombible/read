<div class="chap"><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>For I made up my mind not to make another painful visit to you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>For if I cause you pain, who is there to make me glad but the one whom I have pained?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And I wrote as I did, so that when I came I might not suffer pain from those who should have made me rejoice, for I felt sure of all of you, that my joy would be the joy of you all.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For I wrote to you out of much affliction and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to cause you pain but to let you know the abundant love that I have for you.</p>
<p class="heading">Forgive the Sinner</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now if anyone has caused pain, he has caused it not to me, but in some measure&#8212;not to put it too severely&#8212;to all of you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>For such a one, this punishment by the majority is enough,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>so you should rather turn to forgive and comfort him, or he may be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So I beg you to reaffirm your love for him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For this is why I wrote, that I might test you and know whether you are obedient in everything.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Anyone whom you forgive, I also forgive. Indeed, what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, has been for your sake in the presence of Christ,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>so that we would not be outwitted by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his designs.</p>
<p class="heading">Triumph in Christ</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>When I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ, even though a door was opened for me in the Lord,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>my spirit was not at rest because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I took leave of them and went on to Macedonia.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But thanks be to God, who in Christ always leads us in triumphal procession, and through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of him everywhere.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>to one a fragrance from death to death, to the other a fragrance from life to life. Who is sufficient for these things?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>For we are not, like so many, peddlers of God&#8217;s word, but as men of sincerity, as commissioned by God, in the sight of God we speak in Christ.</p></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
