<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>for I know your readiness, of which I boast about you to the people of Macedonia, saying that Achaia has been ready since last year. And your zeal has stirred up most of them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But I am sending<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or I have sent">a</a></sup></span> the brothers so that our boasting about you may not prove empty in this matter, so that you may be ready, as I said you would be.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Otherwise, if some Macedonians come with me and find that you are not ready, we would be humiliated&#8212;to say nothing of you&#8212;for being so confident.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to go on ahead to you and arrange in advance for the gift<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek blessing; twice in this verse">b</a></sup></span> you have promised, so that it may be ready as a willing gift, not as an exaction.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or a gift expecting something in return; Greek greed">c</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="heading">The Cheerful Giver</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>The point is this: whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows bountifully<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek with blessings; twice in this verse">d</a></sup></span> will also reap bountifully.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that having all sufficiency<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or all contentment">e</a></sup></span> in all things at all times, you may abound in every good work.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>As it is written,</p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">&#8220;He has distributed freely, he has given to the poor;</span><br /><span class="indent">his righteousness endures forever.&#8221;</span></p>
