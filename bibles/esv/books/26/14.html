<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Idolatrous Elders Condemned</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Then certain of the elders of Israel came to me and sat before me.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> came to me:
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, these men have taken their idols into their hearts, and set the stumbling block of their iniquity before their faces. Should I indeed let myself be consulted by them?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Therefore speak to them and say to them, Thus says the Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span>: Any one of the house of Israel who takes his idols into his heart and sets the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and yet comes to the prophet, I the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> will answer him as he comes with the multitude of his idols,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>that I may lay hold of the hearts of the house of Israel, who are all estranged from me through their idols.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>&#8220;Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span>: Repent and turn away from your idols, and turn away your faces from all your abominations.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For any one of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who sojourn in Israel, who separates himself from me, taking his idols into his heart and putting the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and yet comes to a prophet to consult me through him, I the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> will answer him myself.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And I will set my face against that man; I will make him a sign and a byword and cut him off from the midst of my people, and you shall know that I am the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And if the prophet is deceived and speaks a word, I, the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand against him and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And they shall bear their punishment<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or iniquity; three times in this verse">a</a></sup></span>&#8212;the punishment of the prophet and the punishment of the inquirer shall be alike&#8212;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>that the house of Israel may no more go astray from me, nor defile themselves anymore with all their transgressions, but that they may be my people and I may be their God, declares the Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p class="heading">Jerusalem Will Not Be Spared</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> came to me:
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, when a land sins against me by acting faithlessly, and I stretch out my hand against it and break its supply<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew staff">b</a></sup></span> of bread and send famine upon it, and cut off from it man and beast,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>even if these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they would deliver but their own lives by their righteousness, declares the Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span>.</p>
