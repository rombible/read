<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>The length of the building whose door faced north was a hundred cubits,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="A cubit was about 18 inches or 45 centimeters">a</a></sup></span> and the breadth fifty cubits.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Facing the twenty cubits that belonged to the inner court, and facing the pavement that belonged to the outer court, was gallery<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="The meaning of the Hebrew word is unknown; also verse 5">b</a></sup></span> against gallery in three stories.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And before the chambers was a passage inward, ten cubits wide and a hundred cubits long,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Septuagint, Syriac; Hebrew and a way of one cubit">c</a></sup></span> and their doors were on the north.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now the upper chambers were narrower, for the galleries took more away from them than from the lower and middle chambers of the building.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>For they were in three stories, and they had no pillars like the pillars of the courts. Thus the upper chambers were set back from the ground more than the lower and the middle ones.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And there was a wall outside parallel to the chambers, toward the outer court, opposite the chambers, fifty cubits long.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For the chambers on the outer court were fifty cubits long, while those opposite the nave<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or temple">d</a></sup></span> were a hundred cubits long.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Below these chambers was an entrance on the east side, as one enters them from the outer court.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>In the thickness of the wall of the court, on the south<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Septuagint; Hebrew east">e</a></sup></span> also, opposite the yard and opposite the building, there were chambers
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>with a passage in front of them. They were similar to the chambers on the north, of the same length and breadth, with the same exits<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew and all their exits">f</a></sup></span> and arrangements and doors,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>as were the entrances of the chambers on the south. There was an entrance at the beginning of the passage, the passage before the corresponding wall on the east as one enters them.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="The meaning of the Hebrew verse is uncertain">g</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then he said to me, &#8220;The north chambers and the south chambers opposite the yard are the holy chambers, where the priests who approach the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> shall eat the most holy offerings. There they shall put the most holy offerings&#8212;the grain offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering&#8212;for the place is holy.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>When the priests enter the Holy Place, they shall not go out of it into the outer court without laying there the garments in which they minister, for these are holy. They shall put on other garments before they go near to that which is for the people.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Now when he had finished measuring the interior of the temple area, he led me out by the gate that faced east, and measured the temple area all around.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>He measured the east side with the measuring reed, 500 cubits by the measuring reed all around.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>He measured the north side, 500 cubits by the measuring reed all around.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>He measured the south side, 500 cubits by the measuring reed.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then he turned to the west side and measured, 500 cubits by the measuring reed.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>He measured it on the four sides. It had a wall around it, 500 cubits long and 500 cubits broad, to make a separation between the holy and the common.</p><A name="footnotes"></a><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">2</span> A <i class="catch-word">cubit</i> was about 18 inches or 45 centimeters<br /><span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">3</span> The meaning of the Hebrew word is unknown; also verse 5<br /><span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <span class="fnverse">4</span> Septuagint, Syriac; Hebrew <i><span class="catch-word">and a</span> way of one cubit</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">d</span> <span class="fnverse">8</span> Or <i>temple</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">e</span> <span class="fnverse">10</span> Septuagint; Hebrew <i>east</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">f</span> <span class="fnverse">11</span> Hebrew <i>and all their exits</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">g</span> <span class="fnverse">12</span> The meaning of the Hebrew verse is uncertain<br /></span></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
