<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;And you, son of man, will you judge, will you judge the bloody city? Then declare to her all her abominations.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>You shall say, Thus says the Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span>: A city that sheds blood in her midst, so that her time may come, and that makes idols to defile herself!
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>You have become guilty by the blood that you have shed, and defiled by the idols that you have made, and you have brought your days near, the appointed time of<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some Hebrew manuscripts, Septuagint, Syriac, Vulgate, Targum; most Hebrew manuscripts until">a</a></sup></span> your years has come.

<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>&#8220;Behold, the princes of Israel in you, every one according to his power, have been bent on shedding blood.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Father and mother are treated with contempt in you; the sojourner suffers extortion in your midst; the fatherless and the widow are wronged in you.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>There are men in you who slander to shed blood, and people in you who eat on the mountains; they commit lewdness in your midst.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Her priests have done violence to my law and have profaned my holy things.
