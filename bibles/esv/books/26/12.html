<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, you dwell in the midst of a rebellious house, who have eyes to see, but see not, who have ears to hear, but hear not, for they are a rebellious house.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>As for you, son of man, prepare for yourself an exile&#8217;s baggage, and go into exile by day in their sight. You shall go like an exile from your place to another place in their sight. Perhaps they will understand, though<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or will see that">a</a></sup></span> they are a rebellious house.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>You shall bring out your baggage by day in their sight, as baggage for exile, and you shall go out yourself at evening in their sight, as those do who must go into exile.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>In their sight dig through the wall, and bring your baggage out through it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>In their sight you shall lift the baggage upon your shoulder and carry it out at dusk. You shall cover your face that you may not see the land, for I have made you a sign for the house of Israel.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And I did as I was commanded. I brought out my baggage by day, as baggage for exile, and in the evening I dug through the wall with my own hands. I brought out my baggage at dusk, carrying it on my shoulder in their sight.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>In the morning the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> came to me:
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, has not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to you, &#8216;What are you doing?&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Say to them, &#8216;Thus says the Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span>: This oracle concerns<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or This burden is">b</a></sup></span> the prince in Jerusalem and all the house of Israel who are in it.&#8217;<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew in the midst of them">c</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Say, &#8216;I am a sign for you: as I have done, so shall it be done to them. They shall go into exile, into captivity.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And the prince who is among them shall lift his baggage upon his shoulder at dusk, and shall go out. They shall dig through the wall to bring him out through it. He shall cover his face, that he may not see the land with his eyes.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And I will spread my net over him, and he shall be taken in my snare. And I will bring him to Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans, yet he shall not see it, and he shall die there.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And I will scatter toward every wind all who are around him, his helpers and all his troops, and I will unsheathe the sword after them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And they shall know that I am the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, when I disperse them among the nations and scatter them among the countries.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But I will let a few of them escape from the sword, from famine and pestilence, that they may declare all their abominations among the nations where they go, and may know that I am the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221;</p>

In this way her land will be stripped of all it contains, on account of the violence of all those who dwell in it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And the inhabited cities shall be laid waste, and the land shall become a desolation; and you shall know that I am the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221;</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Tell them therefore, &#8216;Thus says the Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span>: I will put an end to this proverb, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel.&#8217; But say to them, The days are near, and the fulfillment<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew word">e</a></sup></span> of every vision.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>For there shall be no more any false vision or flattering divination within the house of Israel.
