<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he said to the man clothed in linen, &#8220;Go in among the whirling wheels underneath the cherubim.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Now the cherubim were standing on the south side of the house, when the man went in, and a cloud filled the inner court.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard as far as the outer court, like the voice of God Almighty when he speaks.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And when he commanded the man clothed in linen, &#8220;Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim,&#8221; he went in and stood beside a wheel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And a cherub stretched out his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim, and took some of it and put it into the hands of the man clothed in linen, who took it and went out.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>The cherubim appeared to have the form of a human hand under their wings.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And as for their appearance, the four had the same likeness, as if a wheel were within a wheel.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of the cherub, and the second face was a human face, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.</p>
