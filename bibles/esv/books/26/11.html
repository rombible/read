And behold, at the entrance of the gateway there were twenty-five men. And I saw among them Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he said to me, &#8220;Son of man, these are the men who devise iniquity and who give wicked counsel in this city;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>who say, &#8216;The time is not near<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or Is not the time near... ?">a</a></sup></span> to build houses. This city is the cauldron, and we are the meat.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Therefore prophesy against them; prophesy, O son of man.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And the Spirit of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> fell upon me, and he said to me, &#8220;Say, Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>: So you think, O house of Israel. For I know the things that come into your mind.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>You have multiplied your slain in this city and have filled its streets with the slain.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Therefore thus says the Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span>: Your slain whom you have laid in the midst of it, they are the meat, and this city is the cauldron, but you shall be brought out of the midst of it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>You have feared the sword, and I will bring the sword upon you, declares the Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span>.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And I will bring you out of the midst of it, and give you into the hands of foreigners, and execute judgments upon you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>You shall fall by the sword. I will judge you at the border of Israel, and you shall know that I am the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>This city shall not be your cauldron, nor shall you be the meat in the midst of it. I will judge you at the border of Israel,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>and you shall know that I am the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. For you have not walked in my statutes, nor obeyed my rules, but have acted according to the rules of the nations that are around you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And it came to pass, while I was prophesying, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then I fell down on my face and cried out with a loud voice and said, &#8220;Ah, Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span>! Will you make a full end of the remnant of Israel?&#8221;</p>
