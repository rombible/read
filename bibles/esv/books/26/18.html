<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;What do you<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="The Hebrew for you is plural">a</a></sup></span> mean by repeating this proverb concerning the land of Israel, &#8216;The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children&#8217;s teeth are set on edge&#8217;?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>As I live, declares the Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span>, this proverb shall no more be used by you in Israel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Behold, all souls are mine; the soul of the father as well as the soul of the son is mine: the soul who sins shall die.</p>

<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8220;If he fathers a son who is violent, a shedder of blood, who does any of these things
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>(though he himself did none of these things), who even eats upon the mountains, defiles his neighbor&#8217;s wife,

<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>&#8220;Now suppose this man fathers a son who sees all the sins that his father has done; he sees, and does not do likewise:
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>he does not eat upon the mountains or lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, does not defile his neighbor&#8217;s wife,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>does not oppress anyone, exacts no pledge, commits no robbery, but gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with a garment,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>withholds his hand from iniquity,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Septuagint; Hebrew from the poor">c</a></sup></span> takes no interest or profit, obeys my rules, and walks in my statutes; he shall not die for his father&#8217;s iniquity; he shall surely live.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>As for his father, because he practiced extortion, robbed his brother, and did what is not good among his people, behold, he shall die for his iniquity.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>&#8220;Yet you say, &#8216;Why should not the son suffer for the iniquity of the father?&#8217; When the son has done what is just and right, and has been careful to observe all my statutes, he shall surely live.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>The soul who sins shall die. The son shall not suffer for the iniquity of the father, nor the father suffer for the iniquity of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon himself.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>&#8220;But if a wicked person turns away from all his sins that he has committed and keeps all my statutes and does what is just and right, he shall surely live; he shall not die.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>None of the transgressions that he has committed shall be remembered against him; for the righteousness that he has done he shall live.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>But when a righteous person turns away from his righteousness and does injustice and does the same abominations that the wicked person does, shall he live? None of the righteous deeds that he has done shall be remembered; for the treachery of which he is guilty and the sin he has committed, for them he shall die.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>&#8220;Yet you say, &#8216;The way of the Lord is not just.&#8217; Hear now, O house of Israel: Is my way not just? Is it not your ways that are not just?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>When a righteous person turns away from his righteousness and does injustice, he shall die for it; for the injustice that he has done he shall die.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Again, when a wicked person turns away from the wickedness he has committed and does what is just and right, he shall save his life.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Because he considered and turned away from all the transgressions that he had committed, he shall surely live; he shall not die.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Yet the house of Israel says, &#8216;The way of the Lord is not just.&#8217; O house of Israel, are my ways not just? Is it not your ways that are not just?</p>
