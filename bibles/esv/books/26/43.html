<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was coming from the east. And the sound of his coming was like the sound of many waters, and the earth shone with his glory.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And the vision I saw was just like the vision that I had seen when he<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some Hebrew manuscripts and Vulgate; most Hebrew manuscripts when I">a</a></sup></span> came to destroy the city, and just like the vision that I had seen by the Chebar canal.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Now let them put away their whoring and the dead bodies of their kings far from me, and I will dwell in their midst forever.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And if they are ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them the design of the temple, its arrangement, its exits and its entrances, that is, its whole design; and make known to them as well all its statutes and its whole design and all its laws, and write it down in their sight, so that they may observe all its laws and all its statutes and carry them out.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>This is the law of the temple: the whole territory on the top of the mountain all around shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the temple.</p>
