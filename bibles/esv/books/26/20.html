<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Israel&#8217;s Continuing Rebellion</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>In the seventh year, in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and sat before me.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> came to me:
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel, and say to them, Thus says the Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span>, Is it to inquire of me that you come? As I live, declares the Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span>, I will not be inquired of by you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Will you judge them, son of man, will you judge them? Let them know the abominations of their fathers,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and say to them, Thus says the Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span>: On the day when I chose Israel, I swore<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew I lifted my hand; twice in this verse; also verses 6, 15, 23, 28, 42">a</a></sup></span> to the offspring of the house of Jacob, making myself known to them in the land of Egypt; I swore to them, saying, I am the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>On that day I swore to them that I would bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, a land flowing with milk and honey, the most glorious of all lands.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And I said to them, &#8216;Cast away the detestable things your eyes feast on, every one of you, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt; I am the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But they rebelled against me and were not willing to listen to me. None of them cast away the detestable things their eyes feasted on, nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt.</p><p class="regular">&#8220;Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them and spend my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But I acted for the sake of my name, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations among whom they lived, in whose sight I made myself known to them in bringing them out of the land of Egypt.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So I led them out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>I gave them my statutes and made known to them my rules, by which, if a person does them, he shall live.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Moreover, I gave them my Sabbaths, as a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> who sanctifies them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness. They did not walk in my statutes but rejected my rules, by which, if a person does them, he shall live; and my Sabbaths they greatly profaned.</p><p class="regular">&#8220;Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them in the wilderness, to make a full end of them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But I acted for the sake of my name, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I had brought them out.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Moreover, I swore to them in the wilderness that I would not bring them into the land that I had given them, a land flowing with milk and honey, the most glorious of all lands,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>because they rejected my rules and did not walk in my statutes, and profaned my Sabbaths; for their heart went after their idols.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Nevertheless, my eye spared them, and I did not destroy them or make a full end of them in the wilderness.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>&#8220;And I said to their children in the wilderness, &#8216;Do not walk in the statutes of your fathers, nor keep their rules, nor defile yourselves with their idols.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>I am the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God; walk in my statutes, and be careful to obey my rules,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>and keep my Sabbaths holy that they may be a sign between me and you, that you may know that I am the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>But the children rebelled against me. They did not walk in my statutes and were not careful to obey my rules, by which, if a person does them, he shall live; they profaned my Sabbaths.</p><p class="regular">&#8220;Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them and spend my anger against them in the wilderness.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But I withheld my hand and acted for the sake of my name, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I had brought them out.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Moreover, I swore to them in the wilderness that I would scatter them among the nations and disperse them through the countries,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>because they had not obeyed my rules, but had rejected my statutes and profaned my Sabbaths, and their eyes were set on their fathers&#8217; idols.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Moreover, I gave them statutes that were not good and rules by which they could not have life,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>and I defiled them through their very gifts in their offering up all their firstborn, that I might devastate them. I did it that they might know that I am the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>&#8220;Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel and say to them, Thus says the Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span>: In this also your fathers blasphemed me, by dealing treacherously with me.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>For when I had brought them into the land that I swore to give them, then wherever they saw any high hill or any leafy tree, there they offered their sacrifices and there they presented the provocation of their offering; there they sent up their pleasing aromas, and there they poured out their drink offerings.
