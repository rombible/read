The water was flowing down from below the south end of the threshold of the temple, south of the altar.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then he brought me out by way of the north gate and led me around on the outside to the outer gate that faces toward the east; and behold, the water was trickling out on the south side.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Going on eastward with a measuring line in his hand, the man measured a thousand cubits,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="A cubit was about 18 inches or 45 centimeters">a</a></sup></span> and then led me through the water, and it was ankle-deep.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Again he measured a thousand, and led me through the water, and it was knee-deep. Again he measured a thousand, and led me through the water, and it was waist-deep.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And he said to me, &#8220;Son of man, have you seen this?&#8221;</p><p class="regular">Then he led me back to the bank of the river.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And wherever the river goes,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Septuagint, Syriac, Vulgate, Targum; Hebrew the two rivers go">d</a></sup></span> every living creature that swarms will live, and there will be very many fish.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Fishermen will stand beside the sea. From Engedi to Eneglaim it will be a place for the spreading of nets.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But its swamps and marshes will not become fresh; they are to be left for salt.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And on the banks, on both sides of the river, there will grow all kinds of trees for food.
