<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Oholah and Oholibah</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>The word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> came to me:
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>They played the whore in Egypt; they played the whore in their youth; there their breasts were pressed and their virgin bosoms<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew nipples; also verses 8, 21">a</a></sup></span> handled.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Oholah was the name of the elder and Oholibah the name of her sister. They became mine, and they bore sons and daughters. As for their names, Oholah is Samaria, and Oholibah is Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8220;Oholah played the whore while she was mine, and she lusted after her lovers the Assyrians, warriors
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>clothed in purple, governors and commanders, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding on horses.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>She bestowed her whoring upon them, the choicest men of Assyria all of them, and she defiled herself with all the idols of everyone after whom she lusted.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>She did not give up her whoring that she had begun in Egypt; for in her youth men had lain with her and handled her virgin bosom and poured out their whoring lust upon her.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Therefore I delivered her into the hands of her lovers, into the hands of the Assyrians, after whom she lusted.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>These uncovered her nakedness; they seized her sons and her daughters; and as for her, they killed her with the sword; and she became a byword among women, when judgment had been executed on her.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8220;Her sister Oholibah saw this, and she became more corrupt than her sister<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew than she">b</a></sup></span> in her lust and in her whoring, which was worse than that of her sister.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>She lusted after the Assyrians, governors and commanders, warriors clothed in full armor, horsemen riding on horses, all of them desirable young men.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And I saw that she was defiled; they both took the same way.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But she carried her whoring further. She saw men portrayed on the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed in vermilion,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>wearing belts on their waists, with flowing turbans on their heads, all of them having the appearance of officers, a likeness of Babylonians whose native land was Chaldea.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>When she saw them, she lusted after them and sent messengers to them in Chaldea.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoring lust. And after she was defiled by them, she turned from them in disgust.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>When she carried on her whoring so openly and flaunted her nakedness, I turned in disgust from her, as I had turned in disgust from her sister.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Yet she increased her whoring, remembering the days of her youth, when she played the whore in the land of Egypt
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>and lusted after her lovers there, whose members were like those of donkeys, and whose issue was like that of horses.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Thus you longed for the lewdness of your youth, when the Egyptians handled your bosom and pressed<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Vulgate, Syriac; Hebrew bosom for the sake of">c</a></sup></span> your young breasts.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Therefore, O Oholibah, thus says the Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;Behold, I will stir up against you your lovers from whom you turned in disgust, and I will bring them against you from every side:
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them, desirable young men, governors and commanders all of them, officers and men of renown, all of them riding on horses.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And they shall come against you from the north<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Septuagint; the meaning of the Hebrew word is unknown">d</a></sup></span> with chariots and wagons and a host of peoples. They shall set themselves against you on every side with buckler, shield, and helmet; and I will commit the judgment to them, and they shall judge you according to their judgments.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And I will direct my jealousy against you, that they may deal with you in fury. They shall cut off your nose and your ears, and your survivors shall fall by the sword. They shall seize your sons and your daughters, and your survivors shall be devoured by fire.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>They shall also strip you of your clothes and take away your beautiful jewels.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Thus I will put an end to your lewdness and your whoring begun in the land of Egypt, so that you shall not lift up your eyes to them or remember Egypt anymore.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>&#8220;For thus says the Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span>: Behold, I will deliver you into the hands of those whom you hate, into the hands of those from whom you turned in disgust,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>and they shall deal with you in hatred and take away all the fruit of your labor and leave you naked and bare, and the nakedness of your whoring shall be uncovered. Your lewdness and your whoring
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>have brought this upon you, because you played the whore with the nations and defiled yourself with their idols.

<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to me: &#8220;Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? Declare to them their abominations.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>For they have committed adultery, and blood is on their hands. With their idols they have committed adultery, and they have even offered up<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or have even made pass through the fire">e</a></sup></span> to them for food the children whom they had borne to me.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>Moreover, this they have done to me: they have defiled my sanctuary on the same day and profaned my Sabbaths.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>For when they had slaughtered their children in sacrifice to their idols, on the same day they came into my sanctuary to profane it. And behold, this is what they did in my house.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>They even sent for men to come from afar, to whom a messenger was sent; and behold, they came. For them you bathed yourself, painted your eyes, and adorned yourself with ornaments.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>You sat on a stately couch, with a table spread before it on which you had placed my incense and my oil.

<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>&#8220;Then I said of her who was worn out by adultery, &#8216;Now they will continue to use her for a whore, even her!&#8217;<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="The meaning of the Hebrew verse is uncertain">g</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>For they have gone in to her, as men go in to a prostitute. Thus they went in to Oholah and to Oholibah, lewd women!
