<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And put siegeworks against it, and build a siege wall against it, and cast up a mound against it. Set camps also against it, and plant battering rams against it all around.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And you, take an iron griddle, and place it as an iron wall between you and the city; and set your face toward it, and let it be in a state of siege, and press the siege against it. This is a sign for the house of Israel.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8220;Then lie on your left side, and place the punishment<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or iniquity; also verses 5, 6, 17">a</a></sup></span> of the house of Israel upon it. For the number of the days that you lie on it, you shall bear their punishment.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For I assign to you a number of days, 390 days, equal to the number of the years of their punishment. So long shall you bear the punishment of the house of Israel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And when you have completed these, you shall lie down a second time, but on your right side, and bear the punishment of the house of Judah. Forty days I assign you, a day for each year.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And you shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem, with your arm bared, and you shall prophesy against the city.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And behold, I will place cords upon you, so that you cannot turn from one side to the other, till you have completed the days of your siege.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;And you, take wheat and barley, beans and lentils, millet and emmer,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="A type of wheat">b</a></sup></span> and put them into a single vessel and make your bread from them. During the number of days that you lie on your side, 390 days, you shall eat it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And your food that you eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="A shekel was about 2/5 ounce or 11 grams">c</a></sup></span> a day; from day to day<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or at a set time daily; also verse 11">d</a></sup></span> you shall eat it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And water you shall drink by measure, the sixth part of a hin;<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="A hin was about 4 quarts or 3.5 liters">e</a></sup></span> from day to day you shall drink.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And you shall eat it as a barley cake, baking it in their sight on human dung.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said, &#8220;Thus shall the people of Israel eat their bread unclean, among the nations where I will drive them.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then I said, &#8220;Ah, Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span>!
