<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Say to the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span>: Thus says the Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span>, Because you said, &#8216;Aha!&#8217; over my sanctuary when it was profaned, and over the land of Israel when it was made desolate, and over the house of Judah when they went into exile,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>therefore behold, I am handing you over to the people of the East for a possession, and they shall set their encampments among you and make their dwellings in your midst.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>therefore, behold, I have stretched out my hand against you, and will hand you over as plunder to the nations.
