<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So I opened my mouth, and he gave me this scroll to eat.

<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And he said to me, &#8220;Son of man, go to the house of Israel and speak with my words to them.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But the house of Israel will not be willing to listen to you, for they are not willing to listen to me: because all the house of Israel have a hard forehead and a stubborn heart.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Behold, I have made your face as hard as their faces, and your forehead as hard as their foreheads.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Moreover, he said to me, &#8220;Son of man, all my words that I shall speak to you receive in your heart, and hear with your ears.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And go to the exiles, to your people, and speak to them and say to them, &#8216;Thus says the Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span>,&#8217; whether they hear or refuse to hear.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then the Spirit<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or the wind; also verse 14">a</a></sup></span> lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or sound">b</a></sup></span> of a great earthquake: &#8220;Blessed be the glory of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> from its place!&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>It was the sound of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, and the sound of the wheels beside them, and the sound of a great earthquake.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>The Spirit lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness in the heat of my spirit, the hand of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> being strong upon me.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And I came to the exiles at Tel-abib, who were dwelling by the Chebar canal, and I sat where they were dwelling.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or Chebar, and to where they dwelt">c</a></sup></span> And I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days.</p>
<p class="heading">A Watchman for Israel</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And at the end of seven days, the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> came to me:
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel. Whenever you hear a word from my mouth, you shall give them warning from me.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>If I say to the wicked, &#8216;You shall surely die,&#8217; and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, in order to save his life, that wicked person shall die for<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or in; also verses 19, 20">d</a></sup></span> his iniquity, but his blood I will require at your hand.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>But if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness, or from his wicked way, he shall die for his iniquity, but you will have delivered your soul.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Again, if a righteous person turns from his righteousness and commits injustice, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he shall die.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>But if you warn the righteous person not to sin, and he does not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning, and you will have delivered your soul.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And the hand of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> was upon me there.
