<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, propound a riddle, and speak a parable to the house of Israel;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>say, Thus says the Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span>: A great eagle with great wings and long pinions, rich in plumage of many colors, came to Lebanon and took the top of the cedar.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>He broke off the topmost of its young twigs and carried it to a land of trade and set it in a city of merchants.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then he took of the seed of the land and planted it in fertile soil.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew in a field of seed">a</a></sup></span> He placed it beside abundant waters. He set it like a willow twig,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and it sprouted and became a low spreading vine, and its branches turned toward him, and its roots remained where it stood. So it became a vine and produced branches and put out boughs.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8220;And there was another great eagle with great wings and much plumage, and behold, this vine bent its roots toward him and shot forth its branches toward him from the bed where it was planted, that he might water it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>It had been planted on good soil by abundant waters, that it might produce branches and bear fruit and become a noble vine.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;Say, Thus says the Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span>: Will it thrive? Will he not pull up its roots and cut off its fruit, so that it withers, so that all its fresh sprouting leaves wither? It will not take a strong arm or many people to pull it from its roots.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Behold, it is planted; will it thrive? Will it not utterly wither when the east wind strikes it&#8212;wither away on the bed where it sprouted?&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> came to me:
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>&#8220;Say now to the rebellious house, Do you not know what these things mean? Tell them, behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and took her king and her princes and brought them to him to Babylon.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And he took one of the royal offspring<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew seed">b</a></sup></span> and made a covenant with him, putting him under oath (the chief men of the land he had taken away),
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>that the kingdom might be humble and not lift itself up, and keep his covenant that it might stand.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But he rebelled against him by sending his ambassadors to Egypt, that they might give him horses and a large army. Will he thrive? Can one escape who does such things? Can he break the covenant and yet escape?</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>&#8220;As I live, declares the Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span>, surely in the place where the king dwells who made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant with him he broke, in Babylon he shall die.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company will not help him in war, when mounds are cast up and siege walls built to cut off many lives.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>He despised the oath in breaking the covenant, and behold, he gave his hand and did all these things; he shall not escape.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Therefore thus says the Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span>: As I live, surely it is my oath that he despised, and my covenant that he broke. I will return it upon his head.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>I will spread my net over him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon and enter into judgment with him there for the treachery he has committed against me.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And all the pick<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some Hebrew manuscripts, Syriac, Targum; most Hebrew manuscripts all the fugitives">c</a></sup></span> of his troops shall fall by the sword, and the survivors shall be scattered to every wind, and you shall know that I am the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>; I have spoken.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Thus says the Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;I myself will take a sprig from the lofty top of the cedar and will set it out.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>On the mountain height of Israel will I plant it, that it may bear branches and produce fruit and become a noble cedar.
