<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, say to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his multitude:</p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">&#8220;Whom are you like in your greatness?</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span><span class="indent">Behold, Assyria was a cedar in Lebanon,</span><br /><span class="ln-group">with beautiful branches and forest shade,</span><br /><span class="indent">and of towering height,</span><br /><span class="indent">its top among the clouds.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or its top went through the thick boughs">a</a></sup></span></span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span><span class="ln-group">The waters nourished it;</span><br /><span class="indent">the deep made it grow tall,</span><br /><span class="ln-group">making its rivers flow</span><br /><span class="indent">around the place of its planting,</span><br /><span class="ln-group">sending forth its streams</span><br /><span class="indent">to all the trees of the field.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span><span class="ln-group">So it towered high</span><br /><span class="indent">above all the trees of the field;</span><br /><span class="ln-group">its boughs grew large</span><br /><span class="indent">and its branches long</span><br /><span class="indent">from abundant water in its shoots.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span><span class="ln-group">All the birds of the heavens</span><br /><span class="indent">made their nests in its boughs;</span><br /><span class="ln-group">under its branches all the beasts of the field</span><br /><span class="indent">gave birth to their young,</span><br /><span class="ln-group">and under its shadow</span><br /><span class="indent">lived all great nations.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span><span class="ln-group">It was beautiful in its greatness,</span><br /><span class="indent">in the length of its branches;</span><br /><span class="ln-group">for its roots went down</span><br /><span class="indent">to abundant waters.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><span class="ln-group">The cedars in the garden of God could not rival it,</span><br /><span class="indent">nor the fir trees equal its boughs;</span><br /><span class="ln-group">neither were the plane trees</span><br /><span class="indent">like its branches;</span><br /><span class="ln-group">no tree in the garden of God</span><br /><span class="indent">was its equal in beauty.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span><span class="ln-group">I made it beautiful</span><br /><span class="indent">in the mass of its branches,</span><br /><span class="ln-group">and all the trees of Eden envied it,</span><br /><span class="indent">that were in the garden of God.</span></p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8220;Therefore thus says the Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span>: Because it<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Syriac, Vulgate; Hebrew you">b</a></sup></span> towered high and set its top among the clouds,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or its top through the thick boughs">c</a></sup></span> and its heart was proud of its height,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>I will give it into the hand of a mighty one of the nations. He shall surely deal with it as its wickedness deserves. I have cast it out.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Foreigners, the most ruthless of nations, have cut it down and left it. On the mountains and in all the valleys its branches have fallen, and its boughs have been broken in all the ravines of the land, and all the peoples of the earth have gone away from its shadow and left it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>On its fallen trunk dwell all the birds of the heavens, and on its branches are all the beasts of the field.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>All this is in order that no trees by the waters may grow to towering height or set their tops among the clouds,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or their tops through the thick boughs">d</a></sup></span> and that no trees that drink water may reach up to them in height.

I clothed Lebanon in gloom for it, and all the trees of the field fainted because of it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>I made the nations quake at the sound of its fall, when I cast it down to Sheol with those who go down to the pit.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>They also went down to Sheol with it, to those who are slain by the sword; yes, those who were its arm, who lived under its shadow among the nations.</p>
