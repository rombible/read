<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Jerusalem, a Useless Vine</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>And the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> came to me:
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, how does the wood of the vine surpass any wood, the vine branch that is among the trees of the forest?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Is wood taken from it to make anything? Do people take a peg from it to hang any vessel on it?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Behold, it is given to the fire for fuel. When the fire has consumed both ends of it, and the middle of it is charred, is it useful for anything?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Behold, when it was whole, it was used for nothing. How much less, when the fire has consumed it and it is charred, can it ever be used for anything!
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Therefore thus says the Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span>: Like the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so have I given up the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And I will set my face against them. Though they escape from the fire, the fire shall yet consume them, and you will know that I am the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, when I set my face against them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And I will make the land desolate, because they have acted faithlessly, declares the Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span>.&#8221;</p></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
