<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, make known to Jerusalem her abominations,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and say, Thus says the Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span> to Jerusalem: Your origin and your birth are of the land of the Canaanites; your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And as for your birth, on the day you were born your cord was not cut, nor were you washed with water to cleanse you, nor rubbed with salt, nor wrapped in swaddling cloths.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>No eye pitied you, to do any of these things to you out of compassion for you, but you were cast out on the open field, for you were abhorred, on the day that you were born.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>&#8220;And when I passed by you and saw you wallowing in your blood, I said to you in your blood, &#8216;Live!&#8217; I said to you in your blood, &#8216;Live!&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>I made you flourish like a plant of the field. And you grew up and became tall and arrived at full adornment. Your breasts were formed, and your hair had grown; yet you were naked and bare.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8220;When I passed by you again and saw you, behold, you were at the age for love, and I spread the corner of my garment over you and covered your nakedness; I made my vow to you and entered into a covenant with you, declares the Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span>, and you became mine.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then I bathed you with water and washed off your blood from you and anointed you with oil.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>I clothed you also with embroidered cloth and shod you with fine leather.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And I adorned you with ornaments and put bracelets on your wrists and a chain on your neck.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And I put a ring on your nose and earrings in your ears and a beautiful crown on your head.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Thus you were adorned with gold and silver, and your clothing was of fine linen and silk and embroidered cloth. You ate fine flour and honey and oil. You grew exceedingly beautiful and advanced to royalty.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And your renown went forth among the nations because of your beauty, for it was perfect through the splendor that I had bestowed on you, declares the Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span>.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>&#8220;But you trusted in your beauty and played the whore<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or were unfaithful; also verses 16, 17, 26, 28">b</a></sup></span> because of your renown and lavished your whorings<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or unfaithfulness; also verses 20, 22, 25, 26, 29, 33, 34, 36">c</a></sup></span> on any passerby; your beauty<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew it">d</a></sup></span> became his.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>You took some of your garments and made for yourself colorful shrines, and on them played the whore.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>You also played the whore with the Egyptians, your lustful neighbors, multiplying your whoring, to provoke me to anger.

<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>&#8220;Therefore, O prostitute, hear the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>:

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>therefore, behold, I will gather all your lovers with whom you took pleasure, all those you loved and all those you hated.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>And I will judge you as women who commit adultery and shed blood are judged, and bring upon you the blood of wrath and jealousy.
