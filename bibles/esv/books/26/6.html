<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and say, You mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span>! Thus says the Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span> to the mountains and the hills, to the ravines and the valleys: Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Your altars shall become desolate, and your incense altars shall be broken, and I will cast down your slain before your idols.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And I will lay the dead bodies of the people of Israel before their idols, and I will scatter your bones around your altars.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Wherever you dwell, the cities shall be waste and the high places ruined, so that your altars will be waste and ruined,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or and punished">a</a></sup></span> your idols broken and destroyed, your incense altars cut down, and your works wiped out.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And the slain shall fall in your midst, and you shall know that I am the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8220;Yet I will leave some of you alive. When you have among the nations some who escape the sword, and when you are scattered through the countries,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>then those of you who escape will remember me among the nations where they are carried captive, how I have been broken over their whoring heart that has departed from me and over their eyes that go whoring after their idols. And they will be loathsome in their own sight for the evils that they have committed, for all their abominations.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And they shall know that I am the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. I have not said in vain that I would do this evil to them.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Thus says the Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;Clap your hands and stamp your foot and say, Alas, because of all the evil abominations of the house of Israel, for they shall fall by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>He who is far off shall die of pestilence, and he who is near shall fall by the sword, and he who is left and is preserved shall die of famine. Thus I will spend my fury upon them.
