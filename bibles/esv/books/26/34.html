<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Prophecy Against the Shepherds of Israel</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>The word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> came to me:
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel; prophesy, and say to them, even to the shepherds, Thus says the Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span>: Ah, shepherds of Israel who have been feeding yourselves! Should not shepherds feed the sheep?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>You eat the fat, you clothe yourselves with the wool, you slaughter the fat ones, but you do not feed the sheep.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>The weak you have not strengthened, the sick you have not healed, the injured you have not bound up, the strayed you have not brought back, the lost you have not sought, and with force and harshness you have ruled them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So they were scattered, because there was no shepherd, and they became food for all the wild beasts. My sheep were scattered;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>they wandered over all the mountains and on every high hill. My sheep were scattered over all the face of the earth, with none to search or seek for them.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8220;Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>:
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>As I live, declares the Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span>, surely because my sheep have become a prey, and my sheep have become food for all the wild beasts, since there was no shepherd, and because my shepherds have not searched for my sheep, but the shepherds have fed themselves, and have not fed my sheep,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>:
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Thus says the Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span>, Behold, I am against the shepherds, and I will require my sheep at their hand and put a stop to their feeding the sheep. No longer shall the shepherds feed themselves. I will rescue my sheep from their mouths, that they may not be food for them.</p>
<p class="heading">The Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span> Will Seek Them Out</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8220;For thus says the Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span>: Behold, I, I myself will search for my sheep and will seek them out.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>As a shepherd seeks out his flock when he is among his sheep that have been scattered, so will I seek out my sheep, and I will rescue them from all places where they have been scattered on a day of clouds and thick darkness.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land. And I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, by the ravines, and in all the inhabited places of the country.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>I will feed them with good pasture, and on the mountain heights of Israel shall be their grazing land. There they shall lie down in good grazing land, and on rich pasture they shall feed on the mountains of Israel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I myself will make them lie down, declares the Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span>.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>I will seek the lost, and I will bring back the strayed, and I will bind up the injured, and I will strengthen the weak, and the fat and the strong I will destroy.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Septuagint, Syriac, Vulgate I will watch over">a</a></sup></span> I will feed them in justice.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Is it not enough for you to feed on the good pasture, that you must tread down with your feet the rest of your pasture; and to drink of clear water, that you must muddy the rest of the water with your feet?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And must my sheep eat what you have trodden with your feet, and drink what you have muddied with your feet?</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Because you push with side and shoulder, and thrust at all the weak with your horns, till you have scattered them abroad,

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And I will set up over them one shepherd, my servant David, and he shall feed them: he shall feed them and be their shepherd.
