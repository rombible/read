<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>therefore prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span>: Precisely because they made you desolate and crushed you from all sides, so that you became the possession of the rest of the nations, and you became the talk and evil gossip of the people,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>therefore, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span>: Thus says the Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span> to the mountains and the hills, the ravines and the valleys, the desolate wastes and the deserted cities, which have become a prey and derision to the rest of the nations all around,

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>So I poured out my wrath upon them for the blood that they had shed in the land, for the idols with which they had defiled it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries. In accordance with their ways and their deeds I judged them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>But when they came to the nations, wherever they came, they profaned my holy name, in that people said of them, &#8216;These are the people of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and yet they had to go out of his land.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>But I had concern for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations to which they came.</p>
