Then he wrote down the dream and told the sum of the matter.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Daniel declared,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Aramaic answered and said">a</a></sup></span> &#8220;I saw in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven were stirring up the great sea.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And four great beasts came up out of the sea, different from one another.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>The first was like a lion and had eagles&#8217; wings. Then as I looked its wings were plucked off, and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand on two feet like a man, and the mind of a man was given to it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And behold, another beast, a second one, like a bear. It was raised up on one side. It had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth; and it was told, &#8216;Arise, devour much flesh.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>After this I looked, and behold, another, like a leopard, with four wings of a bird on its back. And the beast had four heads, and dominion was given to it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>After this I saw in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, terrifying and dreadful and exceedingly strong. It had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces and stamped what was left with its feet. It was different from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots. And behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.</p>
<p class="heading">The Ancient of Days Reigns</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;As I looked,</p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">thrones were placed,</span><br /><span class="indent">and the Ancient of Days took his seat;</span><br /><span class="ln-group">his clothing was white as snow,</span><br /><span class="indent">and the hair of his head like pure wool;</span><br /><span class="ln-group">his throne was fiery flames;</span><br /><span class="indent">its wheels were burning fire.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><span class="ln-group">A stream of fire issued</span><br /><span class="indent">and came out from before him;</span><br /><span class="ln-group">a thousand thousands served him,</span><br /><span class="indent">and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him;</span><br /><span class="ln-group">the court sat in judgment,</span><br /><span class="indent">and the books were opened.</span></p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8220;I looked then because of the sound of the great words that the horn was speaking. And as I looked, the beast was killed, and its body destroyed and given over to be burned with fire.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, but their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.</p>
<p class="heading">The Son of Man Is Given Dominion</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8220;I saw in the night visions,</p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">and behold, with the clouds of heaven</span><br /><span class="indent">there came one like a son of man,</span><br /><span class="ln-group">and he came to the Ancient of Days</span><br /><span class="indent">and was presented before him.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span><span class="ln-group">And to him was given dominion</span><br /><span class="indent">and glory and a kingdom,</span><br /><span class="ln-group">that all peoples, nations, and languages</span><br /><span class="indent">should serve him;</span><br /><span class="ln-group">his dominion is an everlasting dominion,</span><br /><span class="indent">which shall not pass away,</span><br /><span class="ln-group">and his kingdom one</span><br /><span class="indent">that shall not be destroyed.</span></p>
<p class="heading">Daniel&#8217;s Vision Interpreted</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>&#8220;As for me, Daniel, my spirit within me<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Aramaic within its sheath">b</a></sup></span> was anxious, and the visions of my head alarmed me.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>I approached one of those who stood there and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me and made known to me the interpretation of the things.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>&#8216;These four great beasts are four kings who shall arise out of the earth.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever, forever and ever.&#8217;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>&#8220;Then I desired to know the truth about the fourth beast, which was different from all the rest, exceedingly terrifying, with its teeth of iron and claws of bronze, and which devoured and broke in pieces and stamped what was left with its feet,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>and about the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn that came up and before which three of them fell, the horn that had eyes and a mouth that spoke great things, and that seemed greater than its companions.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>As I looked, this horn made war with the saints and prevailed over them,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>until the Ancient of Days came, and judgment was given for the saints of the Most High, and the time came when the saints possessed the kingdom.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>&#8220;Thus he said: &#8216;As for the fourth beast,</p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">there shall be a fourth kingdom on earth,</span><br /><span class="indent">which shall be different from all the kingdoms,</span><br /><span class="ln-group">and it shall devour the whole earth,</span><br /><span class="indent">and trample it down, and break it to pieces.</span><br />

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span><span class="ln-group">He shall speak words against the Most High,</span><br /><span class="indent">and shall wear out the saints of the Most High,</span><br /><span class="indent">and shall think to change the times and the law;</span><br /><span class="ln-group">and they shall be given into his hand</span><br /><span class="indent">for a time, times, and half a time.</span><br />
