And there shall be a time of trouble, such as never has been since there was a nation till that time. But at that time your people shall be delivered, everyone whose name shall be found written in the book.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/12-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/12-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And I heard the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the stream; he raised his right hand and his left hand toward heaven and swore by him who lives forever that it would be for a time, times, and half a time, and that when the shattering of the power of the holy people comes to an end all these things would be finished.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/12-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>I heard, but I did not understand. Then I said, &#8220;O my lord, what shall be the outcome of these things?&#8221;
