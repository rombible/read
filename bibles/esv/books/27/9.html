<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Daniel&#8217;s Prayer for His People</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, by descent a Mede, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans&#8212;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, perceived in the books the number of years that, according to the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> to Jeremiah the prophet, must pass before the end of the desolations of Jerusalem, namely, seventy years.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then I turned my face to the Lord God, seeking him by prayer and pleas for mercy with fasting and sackcloth and ashes.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>I prayed to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> my God and made confession, saying, &#8220;O Lord, the great and awesome God, who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>we have sinned and done wrong and acted wickedly and rebelled, turning aside from your commandments and rules.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>We have not listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>To you, O Lord, belongs righteousness, but to us open shame, as at this day, to the men of Judah, to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to all Israel, those who are near and those who are far away, in all the lands to which you have driven them, because of the treachery that they have committed against you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>To us, O <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, belongs open shame, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>To the Lord our God belong mercy and forgiveness, for we have rebelled against him
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and have not obeyed the voice of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> our God by walking in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>All Israel has transgressed your law and turned aside, refusing to obey your voice. And the curse and oath that are written in the Law of Moses the servant of God have been poured out upon us, because we have sinned against him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>He has confirmed his words, which he spoke against us and against our rulers who ruled us,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or our judges who judged us">a</a></sup></span> by bringing upon us a great calamity. For under the whole heaven there has not been done anything like what has been done against Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>As it is written in the Law of Moses, all this calamity has come upon us; yet we have not entreated the favor of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> our God, turning from our iniquities and gaining insight by your truth.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Therefore the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has kept ready the calamity and has brought it upon us, for the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> our God is righteous in all the works that he has done, and we have not obeyed his voice.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And now, O Lord our God, who brought your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and have made a name for yourself, as at this day, we have sinned, we have done wickedly.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>&#8220;O Lord, according to all your righteous acts, let your anger and your wrath turn away from your city Jerusalem, your holy hill, because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and your people have become a byword among all who are around us.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Now therefore, O our God, listen to the prayer of your servant and to his pleas for mercy, and for your own sake, O Lord,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew for the Lord's sake">b</a></sup></span> make your face to shine upon your sanctuary, which is desolate.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>O my God, incline your ear and hear. Open your eyes and see our desolations, and the city that is called by your name. For we do not present our pleas before you because of our righteousness, but because of your great mercy.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive. O Lord, pay attention and act. Delay not, for your own sake, O my God, because your city and your people are called by your name.&#8221;</p>
<p class="heading">Gabriel Brings an Answer</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>While I was speaking and praying, confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my plea before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> my God for the holy hill of my God,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the first, came to me in swift flight at the time of the evening sacrifice.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>He made me understand, speaking with me and saying, &#8220;O Daniel, I have now come out to give you insight and understanding.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>At the beginning of your pleas for mercy a word went out, and I have come to tell it to you, for you are greatly loved. Therefore consider the word and understand the vision.</p>
