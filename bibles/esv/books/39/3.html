And the Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to his temple; and the messenger of the covenant in whom you delight, behold, he is coming, says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>But who can endure the day of his coming, and who can stand when he appears? For he is like a refiner&#8217;s fire and like fullers&#8217; soap.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and silver, and they will bring offerings in righteousness to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or and they will belong to the LORD, bringers of an offering in righteousness">a</a></sup></span>
