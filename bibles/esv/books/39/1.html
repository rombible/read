But you say, &#8220;How have you loved us?&#8221; &#8220;Is not Esau Jacob&#8217;s brother?&#8221; declares the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. &#8220;Yet I have loved Jacob
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>but Esau I have hated. I have laid waste his hill country and left his heritage to jackals of the desert.&#8221;

If then I am a father, where is my honor? And if I am a master, where is my fear? says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts to you, O priests, who despise my name. But you say, &#8216;How have we despised your name?&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>By offering polluted food upon my altar. But you say, &#8216;How have we polluted you?&#8217; By saying that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s table may be despised.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>When you offer blind animals in sacrifice, is that not evil? And when you offer those that are lame or sick, is that not evil? Present that to your governor; will he accept you or show you favor? says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And now entreat the favor of God, that he may be gracious to us. With such a gift from your hand, will he show favor to any of you? says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Oh that there were one among you who would shut the doors, that you might not kindle fire on my altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you, says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts, and I will not accept an offering from your hand.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For from the rising of the sun to its setting my name will be<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or is (three times in verse 11; also verse 14)">b</a></sup></span> great among the nations, and in every place incense will be offered to my name, and a pure offering.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But you profane it when you say that the Lord&#8217;s table is polluted, and its fruit, that is, its food may be despised.
