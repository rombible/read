<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>If you will not listen, if you will not take it to heart to give honor to my name, says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts, then I will send the curse upon you and I will curse your blessings. Indeed, I have already cursed them, because you do not lay it to heart.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Behold, I will rebuke your offspring,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew seed">a</a></sup></span> and spread dung on your faces, the dung of your offerings, and you shall be taken away with it.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or to it">b</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So shall you know that I have sent this command to you, that my covenant with Levi may stand, says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>My covenant with him was one of life and peace, and I gave them to him. It was a covenant of fear, and he feared me. He stood in awe of my name.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>True instruction<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or law; also verses 7, 8, 9">c</a></sup></span> was in his mouth, and no wrong was found on his lips. He walked with me in peace and uprightness, and he turned many from iniquity.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For the lips of a priest should guard knowledge, and people<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew they">d</a></sup></span> should seek instruction from his mouth, for he is the messenger of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But you have turned aside from the way. You have caused many to stumble by your instruction. You have corrupted the covenant of Levi, says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and so I make you despised and abased before all the people, inasmuch as you do not keep my ways but show partiality in your instruction.&#8221;</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Judah has been faithless, and abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem. For Judah has profaned the sanctuary of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, which he loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign god.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>May the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> cut off from the tents of Jacob any descendant<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew any who wakes and answers">e</a></sup></span> of the man who does this, who brings an offering to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts!</p>
