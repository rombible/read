<p class="heading">The God-Given Task</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>What gain has the worker from his toil?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>I have seen the business that God has given to the children of man to be busy with.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>He has made everything beautiful in its time. Also, he has put eternity into man&#8217;s heart, yet so that he cannot find out what God has done from the beginning to the end.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>I perceived that there is nothing better for them than to be joyful and to do good as long as they live;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>also that everyone should eat and drink and take pleasure in all his toil&#8212;this is God&#8217;s gift to man.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>I perceived that whatever God does endures forever; nothing can be added to it, nor anything taken from it. God has done it, so that people fear before him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>That which is, already has been; that which is to be, already has been; and God seeks what has been driven away.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew what has been pursued">a</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="heading">From Dust to Dust</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Moreover, I saw under the sun that in the place of justice, even there was wickedness, and in the place of righteousness, even there was wickedness.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>I said in my heart, God will judge the righteous and the wicked, for there is a time for every matter and for every work.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>I said in my heart with regard to the children of man that God is testing them that they may see that they themselves are but beasts.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>For what happens to the children of man and what happens to the beasts is the same; as one dies, so dies the other. They all have the same breath, and man has no advantage over the beasts, for all is vanity.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="The Hebrew term hebel can refer to a vapor or mere breath (see note on 1:2)">b</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>All go to one place. All are from the dust, and to dust all return.
