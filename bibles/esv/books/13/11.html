<div class="chap"><p class="heading">David Anointed King</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Then all Israel gathered together to David at Hebron and said, &#8220;Behold, we are your bone and flesh.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>In times past, even when Saul was king, it was you who led out and brought in Israel. And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God said to you, &#8216;You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be prince over my people Israel.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and David made a covenant with them at Hebron before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. And they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> by Samuel.</p>
<p class="heading">David Takes Jerusalem</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, that is, Jebus, where the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>The inhabitants of Jebus said to David, &#8220;You will not come in here.&#8221; Nevertheless, David took the stronghold of Zion, that is, the city of David.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>David said, &#8220;Whoever strikes the Jebusites first shall be chief and commander.&#8221; And Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, so he became chief.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And David lived in the stronghold; therefore it was called the city of David.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And he built the city all around from the Millo in complete circuit, and Joab repaired the rest of the city.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And David became greater and greater, for the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts was with him.</p>
<p class="heading">David&#8217;s Mighty Men</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Now these are the chiefs of David&#8217;s mighty men, who gave him strong support in his kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> concerning Israel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>This is an account of David&#8217;s mighty men: Jashobeam, a Hachmonite, was chief of the three.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Compare 2 Samuel 23:8; Hebrew thirty, or captains">a</a></sup></span> He wielded his spear against 300 whom he killed at one time.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And next to him among the three mighty men was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>He was with David at Pas-dammim when the Philistines were gathered there for battle. There was a plot of ground full of barley, and the men fled from the Philistines.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But he took his<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Compare 2 Samuel 23:12; Hebrew they... their">b</a></sup></span> stand in the midst of the plot and defended it and killed the Philistines. And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> saved them by a great victory.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David at the cave of Adullam, when the army of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then at Bethlehem.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And David said longingly, &#8220;Oh that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem that is by the gate!&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to David. But David would not drink it. He poured it out to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>and said, &#8220;Far be it from me before my God that I should do this. Shall I drink the lifeblood of these men? For at the risk of their lives they brought it.&#8221; Therefore he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Now Abishai, the brother of Joab, was chief of the thirty.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Syriac; Hebrew three">c</a></sup></span> And he wielded his spear against 300 men and killed them and won a name beside the three.

<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was a valiant man<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Syriac; Hebrew the son of a valiant man">f</a></sup></span> of Kabzeel, a doer of great deeds.
