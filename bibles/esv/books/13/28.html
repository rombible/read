<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then King David rose to his feet and said: &#8220;Hear me, my brothers and my people. I had it in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and for the footstool of our God, and I made preparations for building.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But God said to me, &#8216;You may not build a house for my name, for you are a man of war and have shed blood.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Yet the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel chose me from all my father&#8217;s house to be king over Israel forever. For he chose Judah as leader, and in the house of Judah my father&#8217;s house, and among my father&#8217;s sons he took pleasure in me to make me king over all Israel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And of all my sons (for the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has given me many sons) he has chosen Solomon my son to sit on the throne of the kingdom of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> over Israel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>He said to me, &#8216;It is Solomon your son who shall build my house and my courts, for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>I will establish his kingdom forever if he continues strong in keeping my commandments and my rules, as he is today.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Now therefore in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and in the hearing of our God, observe and seek out all the commandments of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God, that you may possess this good land and leave it for an inheritance to your children after you forever.</p>

If you seek him, he will be found by you, but if you forsake him, he will cast you off forever.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Be careful now, for the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary; be strong and do it.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then David gave Solomon his son the plan of the vestibule of the temple,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew lacks of the temple">a</a></sup></span> and of its houses, its treasuries, its upper rooms, and its inner chambers, and of the room for the mercy seat;
