<p class="heading">David Prepares for Temple Building</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>David commanded to gather together the resident aliens who were in the land of Israel, and he set stonecutters to prepare dressed stones for building the house of God.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>David also provided great quantities of iron for nails for the doors of the gates and for clamps, as well as bronze in quantities beyond weighing,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and cedar timbers without number, for the Sidonians and Tyrians brought great quantities of cedar to David.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For David said, &#8220;Solomon my son is young and inexperienced, and the house that is to be built for the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> must be exceedingly magnificent, of fame and glory throughout all lands. I will therefore make preparation for it.&#8221; So David provided materials in great quantity before his death.</p>
<p class="heading">Solomon Charged to Build the Temple</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then he called for Solomon his son and charged him to build a house for the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>David said to Solomon, &#8220;My son, I had it in my heart to build a house to the name of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> my God.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> came to me, saying, &#8216;You have shed much blood and have waged great wars. You shall not build a house to my name, because you have shed so much blood before me on the earth.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Behold, a son shall be born to you who shall be a man of rest. I will give him rest from all his surrounding enemies. For his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quiet to Israel in his days.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>He shall build a house for my name. He shall be my son, and I will be his father, and I will establish his royal throne in Israel forever.&#8217;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8220;Now, my son, the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> be with you, so that you may succeed in building the house of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God, as he has spoken concerning you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Only, may the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> grant you discretion and understanding, that when he gives you charge over Israel you may keep the law of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God.
