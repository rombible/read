<div class="chap"><p class="heading">David&#8217;s Census Brings Pestilence</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Then Satan stood against Israel and incited David to number Israel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So David said to Joab and the commanders of the army, &#8220;Go, number Israel, from Beersheba to Dan, and bring me a report, that I may know their number.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But Joab said, &#8220;May the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> add to his people a hundred times as many as they are! Are they not, my lord the king, all of them my lord&#8217;s servants? Why then should my lord require this? Why should it be a cause of guilt for Israel?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But the king&#8217;s word prevailed against Joab. So Joab departed and went throughout all Israel and came back to Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And Joab gave the sum of the numbering of the people to David. In all Israel there were 1,100,000 men who drew the sword, and in Judah 470,000 who drew the sword.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But he did not include Levi and Benjamin in the numbering, for the king&#8217;s command was abhorrent to Joab.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But God was displeased with this thing, and he struck Israel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And David said to God, &#8220;I have sinned greatly in that I have done this thing. But now, please take away the iniquity of your servant, for I have acted very foolishly.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Gad, David&#8217;s seer, saying,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8220;Go and say to David, &#8216;Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, Three things I offer you; choose one of them, that I may do it to you.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So Gad came to David and said to him, &#8220;Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, &#8216;Choose what you will:
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>either three years of famine, or three months of devastation by your foes while the sword of your enemies overtakes you, or else three days of the sword of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, pestilence on the land, with the angel of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> destroying throughout all the territory of Israel.&#8217; Now decide what answer I shall return to him who sent me.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then David said to Gad, &#8220;I am in great distress. Let me fall into the hand of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, for his mercy is very great, but do not let me fall into the hand of man.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> sent a pestilence on Israel, and 70,000 men of Israel fell.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And God sent the angel to Jerusalem to destroy it, but as he was about to destroy it, the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> saw, and he relented from the calamity. And he said to the angel who was working destruction, &#8220;It is enough; now stay your hand.&#8221; And the angel of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And David lifted his eyes and saw the angel of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> standing between earth and heaven, and in his hand a drawn sword stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And David said to God, &#8220;Was it not I who gave command to number the people? It is I who have sinned and done great evil. But these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand, O <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> my God, be against me and against my father&#8217;s house. But do not let the plague be on your people.&#8221;</p>
<p class="heading">David Builds an Altar</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Now the angel of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> had commanded Gad to say to David that David should go up and raise an altar to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>So David went up at Gad&#8217;s word, which he had spoken in the name of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Now Ornan was threshing wheat. He turned and saw the angel, and his four sons who were with him hid themselves.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David and went out from the threshing floor and paid homage to David with his face to the ground.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And David said to Ornan, &#8220;Give me the site of the threshing floor that I may build on it an altar to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>&#8212;give it to me at its full price&#8212;that the plague may be averted from the people.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Then Ornan said to David, &#8220;Take it, and let my lord the king do what seems good to him. See, I give the oxen for burnt offerings and the threshing sledges for the wood and the wheat for a grain offering; I give it all.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>But King David said to Ornan, &#8220;No, but I will buy them for the full price. I will not take for the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> what is yours, nor offer burnt offerings that cost me nothing.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>So David paid Ornan 600 shekels<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="A shekel was about 2/5 ounce or 11 grams">a</a></sup></span> of gold by weight for the site.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And David built there an altar to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and presented burnt offerings and peace offerings and called on the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span><span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew he">b</a></sup></span> answered him with fire from heaven upon the altar of burnt offering.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Then the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> commanded the angel, and he put his sword back into its sheath.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>At that time, when David saw that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> had answered him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he sacrificed there.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>For the tabernacle of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, which Moses had made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering were at that time in the high place at Gibeon,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>but David could not go before it to inquire of God, for he was afraid of the sword of the angel of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.</p><A name="footnotes"></a><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">25</span> A <i class="catch-word-plural">shekel</i> was about 2/5 ounce or 11 grams<br /><span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">26</span> Hebrew <i>he</i><br /></span></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
