<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Nathan said to David, &#8220;Do all that is in your heart, for God is with you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But that same night the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> came to Nathan,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8220;Go and tell my servant David, &#8216;Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>: It is not you who will build me a house to dwell in.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For I have not lived in a house since the day I brought up Israel to this day, but I have gone from tent to tent and from dwelling to dwelling.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>In all places where I have moved with all Israel, did I speak a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd my people, saying, &#8220;Why have you not built me a house of cedar?&#8221;&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now, therefore, thus shall you say to my servant David, &#8216;Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts, I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, to be prince over my people Israel,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>and I have been with you wherever you have gone and have cut off all your enemies from before you. And I will make for you a name, like the name of the great ones of the earth.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And I will appoint a place for my people Israel and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place and be disturbed no more. And violent men shall waste them no more, as formerly,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>from the time that I appointed judges over my people Israel. And I will subdue all your enemies. Moreover, I declare to you that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> will build you a house.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>When your days are fulfilled to walk with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, one of your own sons, and I will establish his kingdom.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>He shall build a house for me, and I will establish his throne forever.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. I will not take my steadfast love from him, as I took it from him who was before you,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>but I will confirm him in my house and in my kingdom forever, and his throne shall be established forever.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>In accordance with all these words, and in accordance with all this vision, Nathan spoke to David.</p>
<p class="heading">David&#8217;s Prayer</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then King David went in and sat before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and said, &#8220;Who am I, O <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> God, and what is my house, that you have brought me thus far?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And this was a small thing in your eyes, O God.
