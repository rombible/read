And he prepared a place for the ark of God and pitched a tent for it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then David said that no one but the Levites may carry the ark of God, for the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> had chosen them to carry the ark of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and to minister to him forever.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> to its place, which he had prepared for it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And David gathered together the sons of Aaron and the Levites:
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, with 120 of his brothers;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, with 220 of his brothers;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, with 130 of his brothers;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief, with 200 of his brothers;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, with 80 of his brothers;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, with 112 of his brothers.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then David summoned the priests Zadok and Abiathar, and the Levites Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>and said to them, &#8220;You are the heads of the fathers&#8217; houses of the Levites. Consecrate yourselves, you and your brothers, so that you may bring up the ark of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, to the place that I have prepared for it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Because you did not carry it the first time, the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> our God broke out against us, because we did not seek him according to the rule.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So the priests and the Levites consecrated themselves to bring up the ark of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And the Levites carried the ark of God on their shoulders with the poles, as Moses had commanded according to the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>David also commanded the chiefs of the Levites to appoint their brothers as the singers who should play loudly on musical instruments, on harps and lyres and cymbals, to raise sounds of joy.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brothers Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari, their brothers, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>and with them their brothers of the second order, Zechariah, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and the gatekeepers Obed-edom and Jeiel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>The singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were to sound bronze cymbals;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah were to play harps according to Alamoth;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>but Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah were to lead with lyres according to the Sheminith.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Chenaniah, leader of the Levites in music, should direct the music, for he understood it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Berechiah and Elkanah were to be gatekeepers for the ark.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, should blow the trumpets before the ark of God. Obed-edom and Jehiah were to be gatekeepers for the ark.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>So David and the elders of Israel and the commanders of thousands went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> from the house of Obed-edom with rejoicing.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And because God helped the Levites who were carrying the ark of the covenant of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, as also were all the Levites who were carrying the ark, and the singers and Chenaniah the leader of the music of the singers. And David wore a linen ephod.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>So all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> with shouting, to the sound of the horn, trumpets, and cymbals, and made loud music on harps and lyres.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And as the ark of the covenant of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> came to the city of David, Michal the daughter of Saul looked out of the window and saw King David dancing and celebrating, and she despised him in her heart.</p><A name="footnotes"></a><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">1</span> Hebrew <i>He</i><br /></span></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
