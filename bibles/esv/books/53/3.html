<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us, because we were not idle when we were with you,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>nor did we eat anyone&#8217;s bread without paying for it, but with toil and labor we worked night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>It was not because we do not have that right, but to give you in ourselves an example to imitate.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For even when we were with you, we would give you this command: If anyone is not willing to work, let him not eat.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For we hear that some among you walk in idleness, not busy at work, but busybodies.
