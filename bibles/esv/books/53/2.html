<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Let no one deceive you in any way. For that day will not come, unless the rebellion comes first, and the man of lawlessness<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts sin">b</a></sup></span> is revealed, the son of destruction,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek the son of perdition (a Hebrew idiom)">c</a></sup></span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Do you not remember that when I was still with you I told you these things?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And you know what is restraining him now so that he may be revealed in his time.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work. Only he who now restrains it will do so until he is out of the way.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>The coming of the lawless one is by the activity of Satan with all power and false signs and wonders,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and with all wicked deception for those who are perishing, because they refused to love the truth and so be saved.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Therefore God sends them a strong delusion, so that they may believe what is false,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>in order that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness.</p>
