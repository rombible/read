<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jude/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>May mercy, peace, and love be multiplied to you.</p>
<p class="heading">Judgment on False Teachers</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jude/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Beloved, although I was very eager to write to you about our common salvation, I found it necessary to write appealing to you to contend for the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jude/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For certain people have crept in unnoticed who long ago were designated for this condemnation, ungodly people, who pervert the grace of our God into sensuality and deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jude/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now I want to remind you, although you once fully knew it, that Jesus, who saved<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts although you fully knew it, that the Lord who once saved">c</a></sup></span> a people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who did not believe.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jude/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And the angels who did not stay within their own position of authority, but left their proper dwelling, he has kept in eternal chains under gloomy darkness until the judgment of the great day&#8212;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jude/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities, which likewise indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desire,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek different flesh">d</a></sup></span> serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jude/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Yet in like manner these people also, relying on their dreams, defile the flesh, reject authority, and blaspheme the glorious ones.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jude/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But when the archangel Michael, contending with the devil, was disputing about the body of Moses, he did not presume to pronounce a blasphemous judgment, but said, &#8220;The Lord rebuke you.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jude/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>But these people blaspheme all that they do not understand, and they are destroyed by all that they, like unreasoning animals, understand instinctively.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jude/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Woe to them! For they walked in the way of Cain and abandoned themselves for the sake of gain to Balaam&#8217;s error and perished in Korah&#8217;s rebellion.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jude/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>These are hidden reefs<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or are blemishes">e</a></sup></span> at your love feasts, as they feast with you without fear, shepherds feeding themselves; waterless clouds, swept along by winds; fruitless trees in late autumn, twice dead, uprooted;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jude/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>wild waves of the sea, casting up the foam of their own shame; wandering stars, for whom the gloom of utter darkness has been reserved forever.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jude/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>It was also about these that Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied, saying, &#8220;Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of his holy ones,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jude/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>to execute judgment on all and to convict all the ungodly of all their deeds of ungodliness that they have committed in such an ungodly way, and of all the harsh things that ungodly sinners have spoken against him.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jude/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>These are grumblers, malcontents, following their own sinful desires; they are loud-mouthed boasters, showing favoritism to gain advantage.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jude/1-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>It is these who cause divisions, worldly people, devoid of the Spirit.
