<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/32-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, burned with anger. He burned with anger at Job because he justified himself rather than God.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/32-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>He burned with anger also at Job&#8217;s three friends because they had found no answer, although they had declared Job to be in the wrong.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/32-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because they were older than he.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/32-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, he burned with anger.</p>
