<span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/18-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span><span class="ln-group">&#8220;How long will you hunt for words?</span><br /><span class="indent">Consider, and then we will speak.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/18-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span><span class="ln-group">Why are we counted as cattle?</span><br /><span class="indent">Why are we stupid in your sight?</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/18-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span><span class="ln-group">You who tear yourself in your anger,</span><br /><span class="indent">shall the earth be forsaken for you,</span><br /><span class="indent">or the rock be removed out of its place?</span></p>
<p class="line-group"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/18-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span><span class="ln-group">&#8220;Indeed, the light of the wicked is put out,</span><br /><span class="indent">and the flame of his fire does not shine.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/18-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span><span class="ln-group">The light is dark in his tent,</span><br /><span class="indent">and his lamp above him is put out.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/18-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span><span class="ln-group">His strong steps are shortened,</span><br /><span class="indent">and his own schemes throw him down.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/18-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><span class="ln-group">For he is cast into a net by his own feet,</span><br /><span class="indent">and he walks on its mesh.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/18-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span><span class="ln-group">A trap seizes him by the heel;</span><br /><span class="indent">a snare lays hold of him.</span><br />

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/18-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span><span class="ln-group">Terrors frighten him on every side,</span><br /><span class="indent">and chase him at his heels.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/18-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span><span class="ln-group">His strength is famished,</span><br /><span class="indent">and calamity is ready for his stumbling.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/18-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span><span class="ln-group">It consumes the parts of his skin;</span><br /><span class="indent">the firstborn of death consumes his limbs.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/18-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span><span class="ln-group">He is torn from the tent in which he trusted</span><br /><span class="indent">and is brought to the king of terrors.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/18-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span><span class="ln-group">In his tent dwells that which is none of his;</span><br /><span class="indent">sulfur is scattered over his habitation.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/18-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span><span class="ln-group">His roots dry up beneath,</span><br /><span class="indent">and his branches wither above.</span><br />
