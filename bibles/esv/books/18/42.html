<p class="heading">The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> Rebukes Job&#8217;s Friends</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/42-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>After the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> had spoken these words to Job, the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to Eliphaz the Temanite: &#8220;My anger burns against you and against your two friends, for you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/42-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Now therefore take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and offer up a burnt offering for yourselves. And my servant Job shall pray for you, for I will accept his prayer not to deal with you according to your folly. For you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/42-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did what the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> had told them, and the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> accepted Job&#8217;s prayer.</p>

And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> gave Job twice as much as he had before.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/42-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then came to him all his brothers and sisters and all who had known him before, and ate bread with him in his house.

And each of them gave him a piece of money<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew a qesitah; a unit of money of unknown value">c</a></sup></span> and a ring of gold.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/42-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning. And he had 14,000 sheep, 6,000 camels, 1,000 yoke of oxen, and 1,000 female donkeys.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/42-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>He had also seven sons and three daughters.
