<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Satan Attacks Job&#8217;s Health</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/2-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and Satan also came among them to present himself before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to Satan, &#8220;From where have you come?&#8221; Satan answered the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and said, &#8220;From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to Satan, &#8220;Have you considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil? He still holds fast his integrity, although you incited me against him to destroy him without reason.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then Satan answered the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and said, &#8220;Skin for skin! All that a man has he will give for his life.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But stretch out your hand and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse you to your face.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to Satan, &#8220;Behold, he is in your hand; only spare his life.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So Satan went out from the presence of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and struck Job with loathsome sores from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And he took a piece of broken pottery with which to scrape himself while he sat in the ashes.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then his wife said to him, &#8220;Do you still hold fast your integrity? Curse God and die.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>But he said to her, &#8220;You speak as one of the foolish women would speak. Shall we receive good from God, and shall we not receive evil?&#8221;<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or disaster; also verse 11">a</a></sup></span> In all this Job did not sin with his lips.</p>

They made an appointment together to come to show him sympathy and comfort him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And when they saw him from a distance, they did not recognize him. And they raised their voices and wept, and they tore their robes and sprinkled dust on their heads toward heaven.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And they sat with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his suffering was very great.</p><A name="footnotes"></a><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">10</span> Or <i>disaster</i>; also verse 11<br /></span></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
