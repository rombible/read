<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>when they see your respectful and pure conduct.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Do not let your adorning be external&#8212;the braiding of hair and the putting on of gold jewelry, or the clothing you wear&#8212;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>but let your adorning be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God&#8217;s sight is very precious.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For this is how the holy women who hoped in God used to adorn themselves, by submitting to their own husbands,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord. And you are her children, if you do good and do not fear anything that is frightening.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Likewise, husbands, live with your wives in an understanding way, showing honor to the woman as the weaker vessel, since they are heirs with you<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts since you are joint heirs">a</a></sup></span> of the grace of life, so that your prayers may not be hindered.</p>
<p class="heading">Suffering for Righteousness&#8217; Sake</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Finally, all of you, have unity of mind, sympathy, brotherly love, a tender heart, and a humble mind.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Do not repay evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary, bless, for to this you were called, that you may obtain a blessing.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span><span class="ln-group">let him turn away from evil and do good;</span><br /><span class="indent">let him seek peace and pursue it.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span><span class="ln-group">For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous,</span><br /><span class="indent">and his ears are open to their prayer.</span><br /><span class="ln-group">But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Now who is there to harm you if you are zealous for what is good?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But even if you should suffer for righteousness&#8217; sake, you will be blessed. Have no fear of them, nor be troubled,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>having a good conscience, so that, when you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>For it is better to suffer for doing good, if that should be God&#8217;s will, than for doing evil.</p>
