<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Shepherd the Flock of God</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>So I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, as well as a partaker in the glory that is going to be revealed:
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>shepherd the flock of God that is among you, exercising oversight,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts omit exercising oversight">a</a></sup></span> not under compulsion, but willingly, as God would have you;<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts omit as God would have you">b</a></sup></span> not for shameful gain, but eagerly;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>not domineering over those in your charge, but being examples to the flock.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And when the chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Likewise, you who are younger, be subject to the elders. Clothe yourselves, all of you, with humility toward one another, for &#8220;God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God so that at the proper time he may exalt you,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>casting all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Be sober-minded; be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same kinds of suffering are being experienced by your brotherhood throughout the world.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>To him be the dominion forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="heading">Final Greetings</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>By Silvanus, a faithful brother as I regard him, I have written briefly to you, exhorting and declaring that this is the true grace of God. Stand firm in it.
