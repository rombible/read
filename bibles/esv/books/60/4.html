<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>so as to live for the rest of the time in the flesh no longer for human passions but for the will of God.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For the time that is past suffices for doing what the Gentiles want to do, living in sensuality, passions, drunkenness, orgies, drinking parties, and lawless idolatry.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>With respect to this they are surprised when you do not join them in the same flood of debauchery, and they malign you;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>but they will give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>For this is why the gospel was preached even to those who are dead, that though judged in the flesh the way people are, they might live in the spirit the way God does.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>The end of all things is at hand; therefore be self-controlled and sober-minded for the sake of your prayers.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Above all, keep loving one another earnestly, since love covers a multitude of sins.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Show hospitality to one another without grumbling.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>As each has received a gift, use it to serve one another, as good stewards of God&#8217;s varied grace:
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>whoever speaks, as one who speaks oracles of God; whoever serves, as one who serves by the strength that God supplies&#8212;in order that in everything God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. To him belong glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="heading">Suffering as a Christian</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery trial when it comes upon you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>But rejoice insofar as you share Christ&#8217;s sufferings, that you may also rejoice and be glad when his glory is revealed.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts insert and of power">b</a></sup></span> and of God rests upon you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But let none of you suffer as a murderer or a thief or an evildoer or as a meddler.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Yet if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in that name.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>For it is time for judgment to begin at the household of God; and if it begins with us, what will be the outcome for those who do not obey the gospel of God?
