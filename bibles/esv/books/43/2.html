<div class="chap"><p class="heading">The Wedding at Cana</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>On the third day there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Jesus also was invited to the wedding with his disciples.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>When the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus said to him, &#8220;They have no wine.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And Jesus said to her, <span class="woc">&#8220;Woman, what does this have to do with me? My hour has not yet come.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>His mother said to the servants, &#8220;Do whatever he tells you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now there were six stone water jars there for the Jewish rites of purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek two or three measures (metretas); a metretes was about 10 gallons or 35 liters">a</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Jesus said to the servants, <span class="woc">&#8220;Fill the jars with water.&#8221;</span> And they filled them up to the brim.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And he said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Now draw some out and take it to the master of the feast.&#8221;</span> So they took it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>When the master of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and did not know where it came from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), the master of the feast called the bridegroom
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and said to him, &#8220;Everyone serves the good wine first, and when people have drunk freely, then the poor wine. But you have kept the good wine until now.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>This, the first of his signs, Jesus did at Cana in Galilee, and manifested his glory. And his disciples believed in him.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>After this he went down to Capernaum, with his mother and his brothers<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or brothers and sisters.

<p class="heading">Jesus Cleanses the Temple</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>The Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>In the temple he found those who were selling oxen and sheep and pigeons, and the money-changers sitting there.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And making a whip of cords, he drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and oxen. And he poured out the coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And he told those who sold the pigeons, <span class="woc">&#8220;Take these things away; do not make my Father&#8217;s house a house of trade.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>His disciples remembered that it was written, &#8220;Zeal for your house will consume me.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>So the Jews said to him, &#8220;What sign do you show us for doing these things?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Jesus answered them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>The Jews then said, &#8220;It has taken forty-six years to build this temple,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or This temple was built forty-six years ago">c</a></sup></span> and will you raise it up in three days?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>But he was speaking about the temple of his body.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they believed the Scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken.</p>
