<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Jesus Heals a Man Born Blind</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And his disciples asked him, &#8220;Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Jesus answered, <span class="woc">&#8220;It was not that this man sinned, or his parents, but that the works of God might be displayed in him.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span><span class="woc">We must work the works of him who sent me while it is day; night is coming, when no one can work.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span><span class="woc">As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Having said these things, he spit on the ground and made mud with the saliva. Then he anointed the man&#8217;s eyes with the mud
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and said to him, <span class="woc">&#8220;Go, wash in the pool of Siloam&#8221;</span> (which means Sent). So he went and washed and came back seeing.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>The neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar were saying, &#8220;Is this not the man who used to sit and beg?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Some said, &#8220;It is he.&#8221; Others said, &#8220;No, but he is like him.&#8221; He kept saying, &#8220;I am the man.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So they said to him, &#8220;Then how were your eyes opened?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>He answered, &#8220;The man called Jesus made mud and anointed my eyes and said to me, <span class="woc">&#8216;Go to Siloam and wash.&#8217;</span> So I went and washed and received my sight.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>They said to him, &#8220;Where is he?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I do not know.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>They brought to the Pharisees the man who had formerly been blind.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Now it was a Sabbath day when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So the Pharisees again asked him how he had received his sight. And he said to them, &#8220;He put mud on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Some of the Pharisees said, &#8220;This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath.&#8221; But others said, &#8220;How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?&#8221; And there was a division among them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So they said again to the blind man, &#8220;What do you say about him, since he has opened your eyes?&#8221; He said, &#8220;He is a prophet.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>The Jews<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek Ioudaioi probably refers here to Jewish religious leaders, and others under their influence, in that time; also verse 22">a</a></sup></span> did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight, until they called the parents of the man who had received his sight
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>and asked them, &#8220;Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>His parents answered, &#8220;We know that this is our son and that he was born blind.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>But how he now sees we do not know, nor do we know who opened his eyes. Ask him; he is of age. He will speak for himself.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>(His parents said these things because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone should confess Jesus<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek him">b</a></sup></span> to be Christ, he was to be put out of the synagogue.)
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Therefore his parents said, &#8220;He is of age; ask him.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>So for the second time they called the man who had been blind and said to him, &#8220;Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>He answered, &#8220;Whether he is a sinner I do not know. One thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>They said to him, &#8220;What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>He answered them, &#8220;I have told you already, and you would not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become his disciples?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And they reviled him, saying, &#8220;You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where he comes from.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>The man answered, &#8220;Why, this is an amazing thing! You do not know where he comes from, and yet he opened my eyes.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshiper of God and does his will, God listens to him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Never since the world began has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>They answered him, &#8220;You were born in utter sin, and would you teach us?&#8221; And they cast him out.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and having found him he said, <span class="woc">&#8220;Do you believe in the Son of Man?&#8221;<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts the Son of God">c</a></sup></span></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>He answered, &#8220;And who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>Jesus said to him, <span class="woc">&#8220;You have seen him, and it is he who is speaking to you.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>He said, &#8220;Lord, I believe,&#8221; and he worshiped him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>Jesus said, <span class="woc">&#8220;For judgment I came into this world, that those who do not see may see, and those who see may become blind.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>Some of the Pharisees near him heard these things, and said to him, &#8220;Are we also blind?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>Jesus said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;If you were blind, you would have no guilt;<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek you would not have sin">d</a></sup></span> but now that you say, &#8216;We see,&#8217; your guilt remains.</span></p><A name="footnotes"></a><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">18</span> Greek <i language="Greek">Ioudaioi</i> probably refers here to Jewish religious leaders, and others under their influence, in that time; also verse 22<br /><span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">22</span> Greek <i>him</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <span class="fnverse">35</span> Some manuscripts <i><span class="catch-word">the Son</span> of God</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">d</span> <span class="fnverse">41</span> Greek <i><span class="catch-word">you would</span> not have sin</i><br /></span></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
