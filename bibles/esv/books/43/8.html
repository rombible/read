<div class="chap"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Early in the morning he came again to the temple. All the people came to him, and he sat down and taught them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery, and placing her in the midst
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>they said to him, &#8220;Teacher, this woman has been caught in the act of adultery.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now in the Law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. So what do you say?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>This they said to test him, that they might have some charge to bring against him. Jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And as they continued to ask him, he stood up and said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And once more he bent down and wrote on the ground.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But when they heard it, they went away one by one, beginning with the older ones, and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Jesus stood up and said to her, <span class="woc">&#8220;Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>She said, &#8220;No one, Lord.&#8221; And Jesus said, <span class="woc">&#8220;Neither do I condemn you; go, and from now on sin no more.&#8221;</span>]]</p>
<p class="heading">I Am the Light of the World</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, <span class="woc">&#8220;I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So the Pharisees said to him, &#8220;You are bearing witness about yourself; your testimony is not true.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Jesus answered, <span class="woc">&#8220;Even if I do bear witness about myself, my testimony is true, for I know where I came from and where I am going, but you do not know where I come from or where I am going.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span><span class="woc">You judge according to the flesh; I judge no one.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span><span class="woc">Yet even if I do judge, my judgment is true, for it is not I alone who judge, but I and the Father<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts he">a</a></sup></span> who sent me.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span><span class="woc">In your Law it is written that the testimony of two people is true.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span><span class="woc">I am the one who bears witness about myself, and the Father who sent me bears witness about me.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>They said to him therefore, &#8220;Where is your Father?&#8221; Jesus answered, <span class="woc">&#8220;You know neither me nor my Father. If you knew me, you would know my Father also.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>These words he spoke in the treasury, as he taught in the temple; but no one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>So he said to them again, <span class="woc">&#8220;I am going away, and you will seek me, and you will die in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot come.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So the Jews said, &#8220;Will he kill himself, since he says, <span class="woc">&#8216;Where I am going, you cannot come&#8217;</span>?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>He said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span><span class="woc">I told you that you would die in your sins, for unless you believe that I am he you will die in your sins.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>So they said to him, &#8220;Who are you?&#8221; Jesus said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Just what I have been telling you from the beginning.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span><span class="woc">I have much to say about you and much to judge, but he who sent me is true, and I declare to the world what I have heard from him.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>They did not understand that he had been speaking to them about the Father.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>So Jesus said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he, and that I do nothing on my own authority, but speak just as the Father taught me.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span><span class="woc">And he who sent me is with me. He has not left me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to him.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>As he was saying these things, many believed in him.</p>
<p class="heading">The Truth Will Set You Free</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>So Jesus said to the Jews who had believed him, <span class="woc">&#8220;If you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples,</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span><span class="woc">and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>They answered him, &#8220;We are offspring of Abraham and have never been enslaved to anyone. How is it that you say, &#8216;You will become free&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Jesus answered them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who practices sin is a slave<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="For the contextual rendering of the Greek word doulos, see Preface; also verse 35">b</a></sup></span> to sin.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span><span class="woc">The slave does not remain in the house forever; the son remains forever.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span><span class="woc">So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span><span class="woc">I know that you are offspring of Abraham; yet you seek to kill me because my word finds no place in you.</span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span><span class="woc">but now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. This is not what Abraham did.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span><span class="woc">You are doing the works your father did.&#8221;</span> They said to him, &#8220;We were not born of sexual immorality. We have one Father&#8212;even God.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>Jesus said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and I am here. I came not of my own accord, but he sent me.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span><span class="woc">Why do you not understand what I say? It is because you cannot bear to hear my word.</span>

He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks out of his own character, for he is a liar and the father of lies.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span><span class="woc">But because I tell the truth, you do not believe me.</span>
