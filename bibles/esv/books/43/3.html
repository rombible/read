<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Jesus answered him, <span class="woc">&#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or from above; the Greek is purposely ambiguous and can mean both again and from above; also verse 7">b</a></sup></span> he cannot see the kingdom of God.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Nicodemus said to him, &#8220;How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother&#8217;s womb and be born?&#8221;

<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Nicodemus said to him, &#8220;How can these things be?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Jesus answered him, <span class="woc">&#8220;Are you the teacher of Israel and yet you do not understand these things?</span>
