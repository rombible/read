<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Betrayal and Arrest of Jesus</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>When Jesus had spoken these words, he went out with his disciples across the brook Kidron, where there was a garden, which he and his disciples entered.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place, for Jesus often met there with his disciples.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So Judas, having procured a band of soldiers and some officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, went there with lanterns and torches and weapons.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then Jesus, knowing all that would happen to him, came forward and said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Whom do you seek?&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>They answered him, &#8220;Jesus of Nazareth.&#8221; Jesus said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;I am he.&#8221;<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek I am; also verses 6, 8">a</a></sup></span></span> Judas, who betrayed him, was standing with them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>When Jesus<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek he">b</a></sup></span> said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;I am he,&#8221;</span> they drew back and fell to the ground.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So he asked them again, <span class="woc">&#8220;Whom do you seek?&#8221;</span> And they said, &#8220;Jesus of Nazareth.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Jesus answered, <span class="woc">&#8220;I told you that I am he. So, if you seek me, let these men go.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>This was to fulfill the word that he had spoken: <span class="woc">&#8220;Of those whom you gave me I have lost not one.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest&#8217;s servant<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or bondservant; twice in this verse">c</a></sup></span> and cut off his right ear. (The servant&#8217;s name was Malchus.)
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So Jesus said to Peter, <span class="woc">&#8220;Put your sword into its sheath; shall I not drink the cup that the Father has given me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="heading">Jesus Faces Annas and Caiaphas</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So the band of soldiers and their captain and the officers of the Jews<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek Ioudaioi probably refers here to Jewish religious leaders, and others under their influence, in that time; also verses 14, 31, 36, 38">d</a></sup></span> arrested Jesus and bound him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>First they led him to Annas, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>It was Caiaphas who had advised the Jews that it would be expedient that one man should die for the people.</p>
<p class="heading">Peter Denies Jesus</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. Since that disciple was known to the high priest, he entered with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>but Peter stood outside at the door. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the servant girl who kept watch at the door, and brought Peter in.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>The servant girl at the door said to Peter, &#8220;You also are not one of this man&#8217;s disciples, are you?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I am not.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Now the servants<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or bondservants; also verse 26">e</a></sup></span> and officers had made a charcoal fire, because it was cold, and they were standing and warming themselves. Peter also was with them, standing and warming himself.</p>
<p class="heading">The High Priest Questions Jesus</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>The high priest then questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Jesus answered him, <span class="woc">&#8220;I have spoken openly to the world. I have always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all Jews come together. I have said nothing in secret.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span><span class="woc">Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard me what I said to them; they know what I said.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>When he had said these things, one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand, saying, &#8220;Is that how you answer the high priest?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Jesus answered him, <span class="woc">&#8220;If what I said is wrong, bear witness about the wrong; but if what I said is right, why do you strike me?&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Annas then sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.</p>
<p class="heading">Peter Denies Jesus Again</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. So they said to him, &#8220;You also are not one of his disciples, are you?&#8221; He denied it and said, &#8220;I am not.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>One of the servants of the high priest, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, asked, &#8220;Did I not see you in the garden with him?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Peter again denied it, and at once a rooster crowed.</p>
<p class="heading">Jesus Before Pilate</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then they led Jesus from the house of Caiaphas to the governor&#8217;s headquarters.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek the praetorium">f</a></sup></span> It was early morning. They themselves did not enter the governor&#8217;s headquarters, so that they would not be defiled, but could eat the Passover.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>So Pilate went outside to them and said, &#8220;What accusation do you bring against this man?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>They answered him, &#8220;If this man were not doing evil, we would not have delivered him over to you.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Pilate said to them, &#8220;Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law.&#8221; The Jews said to him, &#8220;It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>This was to fulfill the word that Jesus had spoken to show by what kind of death he was going to die.</p>
<p class="heading">My Kingdom Is Not of This World</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>So Pilate entered his headquarters again and called Jesus and said to him, &#8220;Are you the King of the Jews?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Jesus answered, <span class="woc">&#8220;Do you say this of your own accord, or did others say it to you about me?&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Pilate answered, &#8220;Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered you over to me. What have you done?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Jesus answered, <span class="woc">&#8220;My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would have been fighting, that I might not be delivered over to the Jews. But my kingdom is not from the world.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>Then Pilate said to him, &#8220;So you are a king?&#8221; Jesus answered, <span class="woc">&#8220;You say that I am a king. For this purpose I was born and for this purpose I have come into the world&#8212;to bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>Pilate said to him, &#8220;What is truth?&#8221;</p><p class="regular">After he had said this, he went back outside to the Jews and told them, &#8220;I find no guilt in him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>But you have a custom that I should release one man for you at the Passover. So do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?&#8221;
