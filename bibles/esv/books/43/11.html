<div class="chap"><p class="heading">The Death of Lazarus</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Now a certain man was ill, Lazarus of Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>It was Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was ill.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So the sisters sent to him, saying, &#8220;Lord, he whom you love is ill.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But when Jesus heard it he said, <span class="woc">&#8220;This illness does not lead to death. It is for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So, when he heard that Lazarus<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek he; also verse 17">a</a></sup></span> was ill, he stayed two days longer in the place where he was.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then after this he said to the disciples, <span class="woc">&#8220;Let us go to Judea again.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>The disciples said to him, &#8220;Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone you, and are you going there again?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Jesus answered, <span class="woc">&#8220;Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><span class="woc">But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>After saying these things, he said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I go to awaken him.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>The disciples said to him, &#8220;Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he meant taking rest in sleep.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then Jesus told them plainly, <span class="woc">&#8220;Lazarus has died,</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span><span class="woc">and for your sake I am glad that I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So Thomas, called the Twin,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek Didymus">b</a></sup></span> said to his fellow disciples, &#8220;Let us also go, that we may die with him.&#8221;</p>
<p class="heading">I Am the Resurrection and the Life</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Now when Jesus came, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb four days.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek fifteen stadia; a stadion was about 607 feet or 185 meters">c</a></sup></span> off,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them concerning their brother.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, but Mary remained seated in the house.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Martha said to Jesus, &#8220;Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But even now I know that whatever you ask from God, God will give you.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Jesus said to her, <span class="woc">&#8220;Your brother will rise again.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Martha said to him, &#8220;I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Jesus said to her, <span class="woc">&#8220;I am the resurrection and the life.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts omit and the life">d</a></sup></span> Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live,</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span><span class="woc">and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>She said to him, &#8220;Yes, Lord; I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who is coming into the world.&#8221;</p>
<p class="heading">Jesus Weeps</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>When she had said this, she went and called her sister Mary, saying in private, &#8220;The Teacher is here and is calling for you.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And when she heard it, she rose quickly and went to him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha had met him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>When the Jews who were with her in the house, consoling her, saw Mary rise quickly and go out, they followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Now when Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet, saying to him, &#8220;Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come with her also weeping, he was deeply moved<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or was indignant; also verse 38">e</a></sup></span> in his spirit and greatly troubled.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>And he said, <span class="woc">&#8220;Where have you laid him?&#8221;</span> They said to him, &#8220;Lord, come and see.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Jesus wept.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>So the Jews said, &#8220;See how he loved him!&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>But some of them said, &#8220;Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man also have kept this man from dying?&#8221;</p>
<p class="heading">Jesus Raises Lazarus</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>Then Jesus, deeply moved again, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay against it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>Jesus said, <span class="woc">&#8220;Take away the stone.&#8221;</span> Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, &#8220;Lord, by this time there will be an odor, for he has been dead four days.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>Jesus said to her, <span class="woc">&#8220;Did I not tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of God?&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, <span class="woc">&#8220;Father, I thank you that you have heard me.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span><span class="woc">I knew that you always hear me, but I said this on account of the people standing around, that they may believe that you sent me.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>When he had said these things, he cried out with a loud voice, <span class="woc">&#8220;Lazarus, come out.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>The man who had died came out, his hands and feet bound with linen strips, and his face wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Unbind him, and let him go.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="heading">The Plot to Kill Jesus</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>Many of the Jews therefore, who had come with Mary and had seen what he did, believed in him,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span>but some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-47.htm"><b>47</b></a></span>So the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered the council and said, &#8220;What are we to do? For this man performs many signs.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-48.htm"><b>48</b></a></span>If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-49.htm"><b>49</b></a></span>But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, &#8220;You know nothing at all.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-50.htm"><b>50</b></a></span>Nor do you understand that it is better for you that one man should die for the people, not that the whole nation should perish.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-51.htm"><b>51</b></a></span>He did not say this of his own accord, but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-52.htm"><b>52</b></a></span>and not for the nation only, but also to gather into one the children of God who are scattered abroad.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-53.htm"><b>53</b></a></span>So from that day on they made plans to put him to death.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-54.htm"><b>54</b></a></span>Jesus therefore no longer walked openly among the Jews, but went from there to the region near the wilderness, to a town called Ephraim, and there he stayed with the disciples.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-55.htm"><b>55</b></a></span>Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand, and many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover to purify themselves.
