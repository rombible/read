<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Mary Anoints Jesus at Bethany</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Six days before the Passover, Jesus therefore came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So they gave a dinner for him there. Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those reclining with him at table.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Mary therefore took a pound<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek litra; a litra (or Roman pound) was equal to about 11 1/2 ounces or 327 grams">a</a></sup></span> of expensive ointment made from pure nard, and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (he who was about to betray him), said,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8220;Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="A denarius was a day's wage for a laborer">b</a></sup></span> and given to the poor?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>He said this, not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief, and having charge of the moneybag he used to help himself to what was put into it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Jesus said, <span class="woc">&#8220;Leave her alone, so that she may keep it<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or Leave her alone; she intended to keep it">c</a></sup></span> for the day of my burial.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><span class="woc">For the poor you always have with you, but you do not always have me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="heading">The Plot to Kill Lazarus</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>When the large crowd of the Jews learned that Jesus<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek he">d</a></sup></span> was there, they came, not only on account of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So the chief priests made plans to put Lazarus to death as well,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>because on account of him many of the Jews were going away and believing in Jesus.</p>
<p class="heading">The Triumphal Entry</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>The next day the large crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, crying out, &#8220;Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel!&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it, just as it is written,</p>
<span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span><span class="ln-group">&#8220;Fear not, daughter of Zion;</span><br /><span class="ln-group">behold, your king is coming,</span><br /><span class="indent">sitting on a donkey&#8217;s colt!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="same-paragraph"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>His disciples did not understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written about him and had been done to him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>The crowd that had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to bear witness.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>The reason why the crowd went to meet him was that they heard he had done this sign.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>So the Pharisees said to one another, &#8220;You see that you are gaining nothing. Look, the world has gone after him.&#8221;</p>
<p class="heading">Some Greeks Seek Jesus</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Now among those who went up to worship at the feast were some Greeks.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>So these came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and asked him, &#8220;Sir, we wish to see Jesus.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Philip went and told Andrew; Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And Jesus answered them, <span class="woc">&#8220;The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span><span class="woc">Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span><span class="woc">Whoever loves his life loses it, and whoever hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span><span class="woc">If anyone serves me, he must follow me; and where I am, there will my servant be also. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him.</span></p>
<p class="heading">The Son of Man Must Be Lifted Up</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span><span class="woc">&#8220;Now is my soul troubled. And what shall I say? &#8216;Father, save me from this hour&#8217;? But for this purpose I have come to this hour.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span><span class="woc">Father, glorify your name.&#8221;</span> Then a voice came from heaven: &#8220;I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>The crowd that stood there and heard it said that it had thundered. Others said, &#8220;An angel has spoken to him.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Jesus answered, <span class="woc">&#8220;This voice has come for your sake, not mine.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span><span class="woc">Now is the judgment of this world; now will the ruler of this world be cast out.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span><span class="woc">And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>He said this to show by what kind of death he was going to die.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>So the crowd answered him, &#8220;We have heard from the Law that the Christ remains forever. How can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>So Jesus said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;The light is among you for a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, lest darkness overtake you. The one who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span><span class="woc">While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become sons of light.&#8221;</span></p><p class="heading">The Unbelief of the People</p><p class="regular">                  When Jesus had said these things, he departed and hid himself from them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>Though he had done so many signs before them, they still did not believe in him,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>so that the word spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:</p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">&#8220;Lord, who has believed what he heard from us,</span><br /><span class="indent">and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="same-paragraph"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>Therefore they could not believe. For again Isaiah said,</p>
<span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span><span class="ln-group">&#8220;He has blinded their eyes</span><br /><span class="indent">and hardened their heart,</span><br /><span class="ln-group">lest they see with their eyes,</span><br /><span class="indent">and understand with their heart, and turn,</span><br /><span class="indent">and I would heal them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="same-paragraph"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>Isaiah said these things because he saw his glory and spoke of him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>Nevertheless, many even of the authorities believed in him, but for fear of the Pharisees they did not confess it, so that they would not be put out of the synagogue;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>for they loved the glory that comes from man more than the glory that comes from God.</p>
<p class="heading">Jesus Came to Save the World</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>And Jesus cried out and said, <span class="woc">&#8220;Whoever believes in me, believes not in me but in him who sent me.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span><span class="woc">And whoever sees me sees him who sent me.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span><span class="woc">I have come into the world as light, so that whoever believes in me may not remain in darkness.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-47.htm"><b>47</b></a></span><span class="woc">If anyone hears my words and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world but to save the world.</span>
