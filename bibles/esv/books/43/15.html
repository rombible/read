<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/15-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span><span class="woc">Every branch in me that does not bear fruit he takes away, and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes, that it may bear more fruit.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/15-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span><span class="woc">Already you are clean because of the word that I have spoken to you.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/15-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span><span class="woc">Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/15-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span><span class="woc">I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/15-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span><span class="woc">If anyone does not abide in me he is thrown away like a branch and withers; and the branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned.</span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/15-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><span class="woc">By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/15-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span><span class="woc">As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Abide in my love.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/15-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><span class="woc">If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father&#8217;s commandments and abide in his love.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/15-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span><span class="woc">These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full.</span></p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/15-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span><span class="woc">You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you.</span>
