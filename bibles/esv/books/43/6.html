<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Jesus Feeds the Five Thousand</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>After this Jesus went away to the other side of the Sea of Galilee, which is the Sea of Tiberias.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And a large crowd was following him, because they saw the signs that he was doing on the sick.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Jesus went up on the mountain, and there he sat down with his disciples.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was at hand.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Lifting up his eyes, then, and seeing that a large crowd was coming toward him, Jesus said to Philip, <span class="woc">&#8220;Where are we to buy bread, so that these people may eat?&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>He said this to test him, for he himself knew what he would do.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Philip answered him, &#8220;Two hundred denarii<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="A denarius was a day's wage for a laborer">a</a></sup></span> worth of bread would not be enough for each of them to get a little.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter&#8217;s brother, said to him,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what are they for so many?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Jesus said, <span class="woc">&#8220;Have the people sit down.&#8221;</span> Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, about five thousand in number.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Jesus then took the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he distributed them to those who were seated. So also the fish, as much as they wanted.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And when they had eaten their fill, he told his disciples, <span class="woc">&#8220;Gather up the leftover fragments, that nothing may be lost.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So they gathered them up and filled twelve baskets with fragments from the five barley loaves left by those who had eaten.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>When the people saw the sign that he had done, they said, &#8220;This is indeed the Prophet who is to come into the world!&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Perceiving then that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king, Jesus withdrew again to the mountain by himself.</p>
<p class="heading">Jesus Walks on Water</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>got into a boat, and started across the sea to Capernaum. It was now dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>The sea became rough because a strong wind was blowing.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>When they had rowed about three or four miles,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek twenty-five or thirty stadia; a stadion was about 607 feet or 185 meters">b</a></sup></span> they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat, and they were frightened.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>But he said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;It is I; do not be afraid.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then they were glad to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going.</p>
<p class="heading">I Am the Bread of Life</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>On the next day the crowd that remained on the other side of the sea saw that there had been only one boat there, and that Jesus had not entered the boat with his disciples, but that his disciples had gone away alone.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Other boats from Tiberias came near the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they themselves got into the boats and went to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>When they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, &#8220;Rabbi, when did you come here?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Jesus answered them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, you are seeking me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate your fill of the loaves.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span><span class="woc">Do not work for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you. For on him God the Father has set his seal.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then they said to him, &#8220;What must we do, to be doing the works of God?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Jesus answered them, <span class="woc">&#8220;This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>So they said to him, &#8220;Then what sign do you do, that we may see and believe you? What work do you perform?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, &#8216;He gave them bread from heaven to eat.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Jesus then said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span><span class="woc">For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>They said to him, &#8220;Sir, give us this bread always.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Jesus said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;I am the bread of life; whoever comes to me shall not hunger, and whoever believes in me shall never thirst.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span><span class="woc">But I said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span><span class="woc">All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never cast out.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span><span class="woc">For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span><span class="woc">And this is the will of him who sent me, that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me, but raise it up on the last day.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span><span class="woc">For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who looks on the Son and believes in him should have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>So the Jews grumbled about him, because he said, <span class="woc">&#8220;I am the bread that came down from heaven.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>They said, &#8220;Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does he now say, <span class="woc">&#8216;I have come down from heaven&#8217;</span>?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>Jesus answered them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Do not grumble among yourselves.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span><span class="woc">No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him. And I will raise him up on the last day.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span><span class="woc">It is written in the Prophets, &#8216;And they will all be taught by God.&#8217; Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me&#8212;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span><span class="woc">not that anyone has seen the Father except he who is from God; he has seen the Father.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-47.htm"><b>47</b></a></span><span class="woc">Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes has eternal life.</span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-49.htm"><b>49</b></a></span><span class="woc">Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-50.htm"><b>50</b></a></span><span class="woc">This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that one may eat of it and not die.</span>

<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-52.htm"><b>52</b></a></span>The Jews then disputed among themselves, saying, &#8220;How can this man give us his flesh to eat?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-53.htm"><b>53</b></a></span>So Jesus said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.</span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-59.htm"><b>59</b></a></span>Jesus<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek He">d</a></sup></span> said these things in the synagogue, as he taught at Capernaum.</p>
<p class="heading">The Words of Eternal Life</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-60.htm"><b>60</b></a></span>When many of his disciples heard it, they said, &#8220;This is a hard saying; who can listen to it?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-61.htm"><b>61</b></a></span>But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples were grumbling about this, said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Do you take offense at this?</span>
