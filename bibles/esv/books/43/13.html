<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>During supper, when the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon&#8217;s son, to betray him,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God and was going back to God,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>rose from supper. He laid aside his outer garments, and taking a towel, tied it around his waist.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples&#8217; feet and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, &#8220;Lord, do you wash my feet?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Jesus answered him, <span class="woc">&#8220;What I am doing you do not understand now, but afterward you will understand.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Peter said to him, &#8220;You shall never wash my feet.&#8221; Jesus answered him, <span class="woc">&#8220;If I do not wash you, you have no share with me.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Simon Peter said to him, &#8220;Lord, not my feet only but also my hands and my head!&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Jesus said to him, <span class="woc">&#8220;The one who has bathed does not need to wash, except for his feet,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts omit except for his feet">a</a></sup></span> but is completely clean. And you<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="The Greek words for you in this verse are plural">b</a></sup></span> are clean, but not every one of you.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For he knew who was to betray him; that was why he said, <span class="woc">&#8220;Not all of you are clean.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>When he had washed their feet and put on his outer garments and resumed his place, he said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Do you understand what I have done to you?</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span><span class="woc">You call me Teacher and Lord, and you are right, for so I am.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span><span class="woc">If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another&#8217;s feet.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span><span class="woc">For I have given you an example, that you also should do just as I have done to you.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span><span class="woc">Truly, truly, I say to you, a servant<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or bondservant, or slave (for the contextual rendering of the Greek word doulos, see Preface)">c</a></sup></span> is not greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span><span class="woc">If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span><span class="woc">I am not speaking of all of you; I know whom I have chosen.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span><span class="woc">I am telling you this now, before it takes place, that when it does take place you may believe that I am he.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span><span class="woc">Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever receives the one I send receives me, and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="heading">One of You Will Betray Me</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>After saying these things, Jesus was troubled in his spirit, and testified, <span class="woc">&#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>The disciples looked at one another, uncertain of whom he spoke.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>One of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was reclining at table at Jesus&#8217; side,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek in the bosom of Jesus">e</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>so Simon Peter motioned to him to ask Jesus<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek lacks Jesus">f</a></sup></span> of whom he was speaking.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>So that disciple, leaning back against Jesus, said to him, &#8220;Lord, who is it?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Jesus answered, <span class="woc">&#8220;It is he to whom I will give this morsel of bread when I have dipped it.&#8221;</span> So when he had dipped the morsel, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Then after he had taken the morsel, Satan entered into him. Jesus said to him, <span class="woc">&#8220;What you are going to do, do quickly.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Now no one at the table knew why he said this to him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Some thought that, because Judas had the moneybag, Jesus was telling him, &#8220;Buy what we need for the feast,&#8221; or that he should give something to the poor.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>So, after receiving the morsel of bread, he immediately went out. And it was night.</p>
<p class="heading">A New Commandment</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>When he had gone out, Jesus said, <span class="woc">&#8220;Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in him.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span><span class="woc">If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and glorify him at once.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span><span class="woc">Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You will seek me, and just as I said to the Jews, so now I also say to you, &#8216;Where I am going you cannot come.&#8217;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span><span class="woc">A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another.</span>
