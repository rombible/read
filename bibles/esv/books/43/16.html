<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span><span class="woc">And they will do these things because they have not known the Father, nor me.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span><span class="woc">But I have said these things to you, that when their hour comes you may remember that I told them to you.</span></p><p class="heading">The Work of the Holy Spirit</p><p class="regular"><span class="woc">&#8220;I did not say these things to you from the beginning, because I was with you.</span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span><span class="woc">Nevertheless, I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><span class="woc">And when he comes, he will convict the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment:</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span><span class="woc">concerning sin, because they do not believe in me;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><span class="woc">concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father, and you will see me no longer;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span><span class="woc">concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged.</span></p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span><span class="woc">When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth, for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span><span class="woc">He will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you.</span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So some of his disciples said to one another, &#8220;What is this that he says to us, <span class="woc">&#8216;A little while, and you will not see me, and again a little while, and you will see me&#8217;;</span> and, <span class="woc">&#8216;because I am going to the Father&#8217;</span>?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>So they were saying, &#8220;What does he mean by <span class="woc">&#8216;a little while&#8217;</span>? We do not know what he is talking about.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Jesus knew that they wanted to ask him, so he said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Is this what you are asking yourselves, what I meant by saying, &#8216;A little while and you will not see me, and again a little while and you will see me&#8217;?</span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span><span class="woc">In that day you will ask nothing of me. Truly, truly, I say to you, whatever you ask of the Father in my name, he will give it to you.</span>
