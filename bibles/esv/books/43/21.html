<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Simon Peter, Thomas (called the Twin), Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were together.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Simon Peter said to them, &#8220;I am going fishing.&#8221; They said to him, &#8220;We will go with you.&#8221; They went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Just as day was breaking, Jesus stood on the shore; yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Jesus said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Children, do you have any fish?&#8221;</span> They answered him, &#8220;No.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>He said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.&#8221;</span> So they cast it, and now they were not able to haul it in, because of the quantity of fish.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>That disciple whom Jesus loved therefore said to Peter, &#8220;It is the Lord!&#8221; When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his outer garment, for he was stripped for work, and threw himself into the sea.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>The other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they were not far from the land, but about a hundred yards<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek two hundred cubits; a cubit was about 18 inches or 45 centimeters">a</a></sup></span> off.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>When they got out on land, they saw a charcoal fire in place, with fish laid out on it, and bread.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Jesus said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Bring some of the fish that you have just caught.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore, full of large fish, 153 of them. And although there were so many, the net was not torn.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Jesus said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Come and have breakfast.&#8221;</span> Now none of the disciples dared ask him, &#8220;Who are you?&#8221; They knew it was the Lord.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and so with the fish.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>This was now the third time that Jesus was revealed to the disciples after he was raised from the dead.</p>
<p class="heading">Jesus and Peter</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, <span class="woc">&#8220;Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?&#8221;</span> He said to him, &#8220;Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.&#8221; He said to him, <span class="woc">&#8220;Feed my lambs.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>He said to him a second time, <span class="woc">&#8220;Simon, son of John, do you love me?&#8221;</span> He said to him, &#8220;Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.&#8221; He said to him, <span class="woc">&#8220;Tend my sheep.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>He said to him the third time, <span class="woc">&#8220;Simon, son of John, do you love me?&#8221;</span> Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, <span class="woc">&#8220;Do you love me?&#8221;</span> and he said to him, &#8220;Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you.&#8221; Jesus said to him, <span class="woc">&#8220;Feed my sheep.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span><span class="woc">Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, you used to dress yourself and walk wherever you wanted, but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you and carry you where you do not want to go.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>(This he said to show by what kind of death he was to glorify God.) And after saying this he said to him, <span class="woc">&#8220;Follow me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="heading">Jesus and the Beloved Apostle</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them, the one who also had leaned back against him during the supper and had said, &#8220;Lord, who is it that is going to betray you?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, &#8220;Lord, what about this man?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Jesus said to him, <span class="woc">&#8220;If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow me!&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>So the saying spread abroad among the brothers<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or brothers and sisters">b</a></sup></span> that this disciple was not to die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not to die, but, <span class="woc">&#8220;If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>This is the disciple who is bearing witness about these things, and who has written these things, and we know that his testimony is true.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Now there are also many other things that Jesus did. Were every one of them to be written, I suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be written.</p><A name="footnotes"></a><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">8</span> Greek <i>two hundred cubits</i>; a <i>cubit</i> was about 18 inches or 45 centimeters<br /><span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">23</span> Or <i><span class="catch-word">brothers</span> and sisters</i><br /></span></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
