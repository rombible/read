<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span><span class="woc">But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span><span class="woc">To him the gatekeeper opens. The sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span><span class="woc">When he has brought out all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span><span class="woc">A stranger they will not follow, but they will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>This figure of speech Jesus used with them, but they did not understand what he was saying to them.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So Jesus again said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><span class="woc">All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span><span class="woc">I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><span class="woc">The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span><span class="woc">I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span><span class="woc">He who is a hired hand and not a shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees, and the wolf snatches them and scatters them.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span><span class="woc">He flees because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span><span class="woc">I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me,</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span><span class="woc">just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span><span class="woc">And I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice. So there will be one flock, one shepherd.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span><span class="woc">For this reason the Father loves me, because I lay down my life that I may take it up again.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span><span class="woc">No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up again. This charge I have received from my Father.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>There was again a division among the Jews because of these words.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Many of them said, &#8220;He has a demon, and is insane; why listen to him?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Others said, &#8220;These are not the words of one who is oppressed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?&#8221;</p>
<p class="heading">I and the Father Are One</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>At that time the Feast of Dedication took place at Jerusalem. It was winter,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>and Jesus was walking in the temple, in the colonnade of Solomon.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>So the Jews gathered around him and said to him, &#8220;How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Jesus answered them, <span class="woc">&#8220;I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father&#8217;s name bear witness about me,</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span><span class="woc">but you do not believe because you are not among my sheep.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span><span class="woc">My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span><span class="woc">I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.</span>

<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>The Jews picked up stones again to stone him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Jesus answered them, <span class="woc">&#8220;I have shown you many good works from the Father; for which of them are you going to stone me?&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>The Jews answered him, &#8220;It is not for a good work that we are going to stone you but for blasphemy, because you, being a man, make yourself God.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Jesus answered them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Is it not written in your Law, &#8216;I said, you are gods&#8217;?</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span><span class="woc">If he called them gods to whom the word of God came&#8212;and Scripture cannot be broken&#8212;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span><span class="woc">do you say of him whom the Father consecrated and sent into the world, &#8216;You are blaspheming,&#8217; because I said, &#8216;I am the Son of God&#8217;?</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span><span class="woc">If I am not doing the works of my Father, then do not believe me;</span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>Again they sought to arrest him, but he escaped from their hands.</p>
