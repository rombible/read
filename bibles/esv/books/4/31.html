<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Avenge the people of Israel on the Midianites. Afterward you shall be gathered to your people.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So Moses spoke to the people, saying, &#8220;Arm men from among you for the war, that they may go against Midian to execute the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s vengeance on Midian.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>You shall send a thousand from each of the tribes of Israel to the war.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So there were provided, out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand from each tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand from each tribe, together with Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, with the vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets for the alarm in his hand.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>They warred against Midian, as the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> commanded Moses, and killed every male.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>They killed the kings of Midian with the rest of their slain, Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian. And they also killed Balaam the son of Beor with the sword.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And the people of Israel took captive the women of Midian and their little ones, and they took as plunder all their cattle, their flocks, and all their goods.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>All their cities in the places where they lived, and all their encampments, they burned with fire,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>and took all the spoil and all the plunder, both of man and of beast.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then they brought the captives and the plunder and the spoil to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of the people of Israel, at the camp on the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the chiefs of the congregation went to meet them outside the camp.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And Moses was angry with the officers of the army, the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds, who had come from service in the war.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Moses said to them, &#8220;Have you let all the women live?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Behold, these, on Balaam&#8217;s advice, caused the people of Israel to act treacherously against the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> in the incident of Peor, and so the plague came among the congregation of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Now therefore, kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known man by lying with him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>But all the young girls who have not known man by lying with him keep alive for yourselves.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Encamp outside the camp seven days. Whoever of you has killed any person and whoever has touched any slain, purify yourselves and your captives on the third day and on the seventh day.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>You shall purify every garment, every article of skin, all work of goats&#8217; hair, and every article of wood.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then Eleazar the priest said to the men in the army who had gone to battle: &#8220;This is the statute of the law that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has commanded Moses:
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>only the gold, the silver, the bronze, the iron, the tin, and the lead,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>everything that can stand the fire, you shall pass through the fire, and it shall be clean. Nevertheless, it shall also be purified with the water for impurity. And whatever cannot stand the fire, you shall pass through the water.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>You must wash your clothes on the seventh day, and you shall be clean. And afterward you may come into the camp.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>&#8220;Take the count of the plunder that was taken, both of man and of beast, you and Eleazar the priest and the heads of the fathers&#8217; houses of the congregation,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>and divide the plunder into two parts between the warriors who went out to battle and all the congregation.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And levy for the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> a tribute from the men of war who went out to battle, one out of five hundred, of the people and of the oxen and of the donkeys and of the flocks.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Take it from their half and give it to Eleazar the priest as a contribution to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And from the people of Israel&#8217;s half you shall take one drawn out of every fifty, of the people, of the oxen, of the donkeys, and of the flocks, of all the cattle, and give them to the Levites who keep guard over the tabernacle of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Now the plunder remaining of the spoil that the army took was 675,000 sheep,

<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>From the people of Israel&#8217;s half, which Moses separated from that of the men who had served in the army&#8212;

<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-48.htm"><b>48</b></a></span>Then the officers who were over the thousands of the army, the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds, came near to Moses
