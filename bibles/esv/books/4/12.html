<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Miriam and Aaron Oppose Moses</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/12-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married, for he had married a Cushite woman.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/12-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And they said, &#8220;Has the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> indeed spoken only through Moses? Has he not spoken through us also?&#8221; And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> heard it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/12-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Now the man Moses was very meek, more than all people who were on the face of the earth.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/12-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And suddenly the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses and to Aaron and Miriam, &#8220;Come out, you three, to the tent of meeting.&#8221; And the three of them came out.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/12-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> came down in a pillar of cloud and stood at the entrance of the tent and called Aaron and Miriam, and they both came forward.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/12-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;Hear my words: If there is a prophet among you, I the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> make myself known to him in a vision; I speak with him in a dream.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/12-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Not so with my servant Moses. He is faithful in all my house.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/12-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>With him I speak mouth to mouth, clearly, and not in riddles, and he beholds the form of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/12-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And the anger of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> was kindled against them, and he departed.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/12-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>When the cloud removed from over the tent, behold, Miriam was leprous,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Leprosy was a term for several skin diseases; see Leviticus 13">a</a></sup></span> like snow. And Aaron turned toward Miriam, and behold, she was leprous.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/12-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And Aaron said to Moses, &#8220;Oh, my lord, do not punish us<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew do not lay sin upon us">b</a></sup></span> because we have done foolishly and have sinned.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/12-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Let her not be as one dead, whose flesh is half eaten away when he comes out of his mother&#8217;s womb.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/12-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And Moses cried to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, &#8220;O God, please heal her&#8212;please.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/12-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be shamed seven days? Let her be shut outside the camp seven days, and after that she may be brought in again.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/12-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So Miriam was shut outside the camp seven days, and the people did not set out on the march till Miriam was brought in again.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/12-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>After that the people set out from Hazeroth, and camped in the wilderness of Paran.</p><A name="footnotes"></a><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">10</span> <i>Leprosy</i> was a term for several skin diseases; see Leviticus 13<br /><span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">11</span> Hebrew <i><span class="catch-word">do not</span> lay sin upon us</i><br /></span></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
