<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Thus you shall do to them to cleanse them: sprinkle the water of purification upon them, and let them go with a razor over all their body, and wash their clothes and cleanse themselves.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then let them take a bull from the herd and its grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil, and you shall take another bull from the herd for a sin offering.
