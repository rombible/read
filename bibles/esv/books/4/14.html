<div class="chap"><p class="heading">The People Rebel</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Then all the congregation raised a loud cry, and the people wept that night.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And all the people of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron. The whole congregation said to them, &#8220;Would that we had died in the land of Egypt! Or would that we had died in this wilderness!
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Why is the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> bringing us into this land, to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will become a prey. Would it not be better for us to go back to Egypt?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And they said to one another, &#8220;Let us choose a leader and go back to Egypt.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the people of Israel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were among those who had spied out the land, tore their clothes
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and said to all the congregation of the people of Israel, &#8220;The land, which we passed through to spy it out, is an exceedingly good land.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>If the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> delights in us, he will bring us into this land and give it to us, a land that flows with milk and honey.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Only do not rebel against the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. And do not fear the people of the land, for they are bread for us. Their protection is removed from them, and the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> is with us; do not fear them.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then all the congregation said to stone them with stones. But the glory of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> appeared at the tent of meeting to all the people of Israel.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;How long will this people despise me? And how long will they not believe in me, in spite of all the signs that I have done among them?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>I will strike them with the pestilence and disinherit them, and I will make of you a nation greater and mightier than they.&#8221;</p>
<p class="heading">Moses Intercedes for the People</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>But Moses said to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, &#8220;Then the Egyptians will hear of it, for you brought up this people in your might from among them,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>and they will tell the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that you, O <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, are in the midst of this people. For you, O <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, are seen face to face, and your cloud stands over them and you go before them, in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Now if you kill this people as one man, then the nations who have heard your fame will say,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>&#8216;It is because the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> was not able to bring this people into the land that he swore to give to them that he has killed them in the wilderness.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And now, please let the power of the Lord be great as you have promised, saying,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>&#8216;The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> is slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love, forgiving iniquity and transgression, but he will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, to the third and the fourth generation.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Please pardon the iniquity of this people, according to the greatness of your steadfast love, just as you have forgiven this people, from Egypt until now.&#8221;</p>
<p class="heading">God Promises Judgment</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said, &#8220;I have pardoned, according to your word.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>But truly, as I live, and as all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>none of the men who have seen my glory and my signs that I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and yet have put me to the test these ten times and have not obeyed my voice,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>shall see the land that I swore to give to their fathers. And none of those who despised me shall see it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>But my servant Caleb, because he has a different spirit and has followed me fully, I will bring into the land into which he went, and his descendants shall possess it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Now, since the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwell in the valleys, turn tomorrow and set out for the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>&#8220;How long shall this wicked congregation grumble against me? I have heard the grumblings of the people of Israel, which they grumble against me.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Say to them, &#8216;As I live, declares the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, what you have said in my hearing I will do to you:
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness, and of all your number, listed in the census from twenty years old and upward, who have grumbled against me,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>not one shall come into the land where I swore that I would make you dwell, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>But your little ones, who you said would become a prey, I will bring in, and they shall know the land that you have rejected.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>But as for you, your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And your children shall be shepherds in the wilderness forty years and shall suffer for your faithlessness, until the last of your dead bodies lies in the wilderness.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>According to the number of the days in which you spied out the land, forty days, a year for each day, you shall bear your iniquity forty years, and you shall know my displeasure.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>I, the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, have spoken. Surely this will I do to all this wicked congregation who are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall come to a full end, and there they shall die.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>And the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned and made all the congregation grumble against him by bringing up a bad report about the land&#8212;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>the men who brought up a bad report of the land&#8212;died by plague before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>Of those men who went to spy out the land, only Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh remained alive.</p>
<p class="heading">Israel Defeated in Battle</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>When Moses told these words to all the people of Israel, the people mourned greatly.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>And they rose early in the morning and went up to the heights of the hill country, saying, &#8220;Here we are. We will go up to the place that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has promised, for we have sinned.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>But Moses said, &#8220;Why now are you transgressing the command of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, when that will not succeed?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>Do not go up, for the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> is not among you, lest you be struck down before your enemies.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>For there the Amalekites and the Canaanites are facing you, and you shall fall by the sword. Because you have turned back from following the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> will not be with you.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>But they presumed to go up to the heights of the hill country, although neither the ark of the covenant of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> nor Moses departed out of the camp.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>Then the Amalekites and the Canaanites who lived in that hill country came down and defeated them and pursued them, even to Hormah.</p></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
