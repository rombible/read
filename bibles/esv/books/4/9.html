<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Let the people of Israel keep the Passover at its appointed time.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>On the fourteenth day of this month, at twilight, you shall keep it at its appointed time; according to all its statutes and all its rules you shall keep it.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So Moses told the people of Israel that they should keep the Passover.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And they kept the Passover in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, at twilight, in the wilderness of Sinai; according to all that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> commanded Moses, so the people of Israel did.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And there were certain men who were unclean through touching a dead body, so that they could not keep the Passover on that day, and they came before Moses and Aaron on that day.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And those men said to him, &#8220;We are unclean through touching a dead body. Why are we kept from bringing the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s offering at its appointed time among the people of Israel?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And Moses said to them, &#8220;Wait, that I may hear what the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> will command concerning you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8220;Speak to the people of Israel, saying, If any one of you or of your descendants is unclean through touching a dead body, or is on a long journey, he shall still keep the Passover to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>In the second month on the fourteenth day at twilight they shall keep it. They shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>They shall leave none of it until the morning, nor break any of its bones; according to all the statute for the Passover they shall keep it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>But if anyone who is clean and is not on a journey fails to keep the Passover, that person shall be cut off from his people because he did not bring the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s offering at its appointed time; that man shall bear his sin.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And if a stranger sojourns among you and would keep the Passover to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, according to the statute of the Passover and according to its rule, so shall he do. You shall have one statute, both for the sojourner and for the native.&#8221;</p>
<p class="heading">The Cloud Covering the Tabernacle</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>On the day that the tabernacle was set up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, the tent of the testimony. And at evening it was over the tabernacle like the appearance of fire until morning.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So it was always: the cloud covered it by day<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Septuagint, Syriac, Vulgate; Hebrew lacks by day">a</a></sup></span> and the appearance of fire by night.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And whenever the cloud lifted from over the tent, after that the people of Israel set out, and in the place where the cloud settled down, there the people of Israel camped.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>At the command of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> the people of Israel set out, and at the command of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> they camped.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Even when the cloud continued over the tabernacle many days, the people of Israel kept the charge of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and did not set out.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Sometimes the cloud was a few days over the tabernacle, and according to the command of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> they remained in camp; then according to the command of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> they set out.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And sometimes the cloud remained from evening until morning. And when the cloud lifted in the morning, they set out, or if it continued for a day and a night, when the cloud lifted they set out.
