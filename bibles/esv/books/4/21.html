<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people, so that many people of Israel died.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;Make a fiery serpent and set it on a pole, and everyone who is bitten, when he sees it, shall live.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So Moses made a bronze<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or copper">c</a></sup></span> serpent and set it on a pole.
