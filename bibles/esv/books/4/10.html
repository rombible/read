<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Make two silver trumpets. Of hammered work you shall make them, and you shall use them for summoning the congregation and for breaking camp.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And when both are blown, all the congregation shall gather themselves to you at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But if they blow only one, then the chiefs, the heads of the tribes of Israel, shall gather themselves to you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>When you blow an alarm, the camps that are on the east side shall set out.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And when you blow an alarm the second time, the camps that are on the south side shall set out. An alarm is to be blown whenever they are to set out.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But when the assembly is to be gathered together, you shall blow a long blast, but you shall not sound an alarm.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets. The trumpets shall be to you for a perpetual statute throughout your generations.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And when you go to war in your land against the adversary who oppresses you, then you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets, that you may be remembered before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God, and you shall be saved from your enemies.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>On the day of your gladness also, and at your appointed feasts and at the beginnings of your months, you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings. They shall be a reminder of you before your God: I am the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God.&#8221;</p>
