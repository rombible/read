<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>&#8220;All the days that he separates himself to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> he shall not go near a dead body.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Not even for his father or for his mother, for brother or sister, if they die, shall he make himself unclean, because his separation to God is on his head.

<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;And if any man dies very suddenly beside him and he defiles his consecrated head, then he shall shave his head on the day of his cleansing; on the seventh day he shall shave it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/6-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>On the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves or two pigeons to the priest to the entrance of the tent of meeting,

<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/6-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8220;And this is the law for the Nazirite, when the time of his separation has been completed: he shall be brought to the entrance of the tent of meeting,

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/6-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.

<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/6-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>&#8220;This is the law of the Nazirite.
