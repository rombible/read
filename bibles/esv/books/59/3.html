<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>For we all stumble in many ways. And if anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect man, able also to bridle his whole body.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>If we put bits into the mouths of horses so that they obey us, we guide their whole bodies as well.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Look at the ships also: though they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So also the tongue is a small member, yet it boasts of great things.</p><p class="regular">How great a forest is set ablaze by such a small fire!
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And the tongue is a fire, a world of unrighteousness. The tongue is set among our members, staining the whole body, setting on fire the entire course of life,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or wheel of birth">a</a></sup></span> and set on fire by hell.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek Gehenna">b</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For every kind of beast and bird, of reptile and sea creature, can be tamed and has been tamed by mankind,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>but no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people who are made in the likeness of God.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or brothers and sisters; also verse 12">c</a></sup></span> these things ought not to be so.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Does a spring pour forth from the same opening both fresh and salt water?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Can a fig tree, my brothers, bear olives, or a grapevine produce figs? Neither can a salt pond yield fresh water.</p>
<p class="heading">Wisdom from Above</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Who is wise and understanding among you? By his good conduct let him show his works in the meekness of wisdom.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast and be false to the truth.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>This is not the wisdom that comes down from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/3-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there will be disorder and every vile practice.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial and sincere.
