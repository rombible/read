<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>You desire and do not have, so you murder. You covet and cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel. You do not have, because you do not ask.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>You ask and do not receive, because you ask wrongly, to spend it on your passions.

Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Or do you suppose it is to no purpose that the Scripture says, &#8220;He yearns jealously over the spirit that he has made to dwell in us&#8221;?

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Be wretched and mourn and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom.

But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>There is only one lawgiver and judge, he who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge your neighbor?</p>
