<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John the son of Zechariah in the wilderness.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And he went into all the region around the Jordan, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.

<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And the crowds asked him, &#8220;What then shall we do?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And he answered them, &#8220;Whoever has two tunics<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek chiton, a long garment worn under the cloak next to the skin">b</a></sup></span> is to share with him who has none, and whoever has food is to do likewise.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Tax collectors also came to be baptized and said to him, &#8220;Teacher, what shall we do?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And he said to them, &#8220;Collect no more than you are authorized to do.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Soldiers also asked him, &#8220;And we, what shall we do?&#8221; And he said to them, &#8220;Do not extort money from anyone by threats or by false accusation, and be content with your wages.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>As the people were in expectation, and all were questioning in their hearts concerning John, whether he might be the Christ,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/3-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>John answered them all, saying, &#8220;I baptize you with water, but he who is mightier than I is coming, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
