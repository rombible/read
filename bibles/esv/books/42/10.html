<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few. Therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span><span class="woc">Go your way; behold, I am sending you out as lambs in the midst of wolves.</span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/10-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span><span class="woc">For I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.&#8221;</span></p>
