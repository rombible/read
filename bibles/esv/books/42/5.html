<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Jesus Calls the First Disciples</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>On one occasion, while the crowd was pressing in on him to hear the word of God, he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and he saw two boats by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Getting into one of the boats, which was Simon&#8217;s, he asked him to put out a little from the land. And he sat down and taught the people from the boat.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And when he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, <span class="woc">&#8220;Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And Simon answered, &#8220;Master, we toiled all night and took nothing! But at your word I will let down the nets.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And when they had done this, they enclosed a large number of fish, and their nets were breaking.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>They signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But when Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus&#8217; knees, saying, &#8220;Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For he and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish that they had taken,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, <span class="woc">&#8220;Do not be afraid; from now on you will be catching men.&#8221;<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="The Greek word anthropoi refers here to both men and women">a</a></sup></span></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And when they had brought their boats to land, they left everything and followed him.</p>
<p class="heading">Jesus Cleanses a Leper</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>While he was in one of the cities, there came a man full of leprosy.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Leprosy was a term for several skin diseases; see Leviticus 13">b</a></sup></span> And when he saw Jesus, he fell on his face and begged him, &#8220;Lord, if you will, you can make me clean.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And Jesus<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek he">c</a></sup></span> stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, <span class="woc">&#8220;I will; be clean.&#8221;</span> And immediately the leprosy left him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And he charged him to tell no one, but <span class="woc">&#8220;go and show yourself to the priest, and make an offering for your cleansing, as Moses commanded, for a proof to them.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But now even more the report about him went abroad, and great crowds gathered to hear him and to be healed of their infirmities.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But he would withdraw to desolate places and pray.</p>
<p class="heading">Jesus Heals a Paralytic</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>On one of those days, as he was teaching, Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there, who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was with him to heal.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts was present to heal them">d</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And behold, some men were bringing on a bed a man who was paralyzed, and they were seeking to bring him in and lay him before Jesus,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>but finding no way to bring him in, because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down with his bed through the tiles into the midst before Jesus.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And when he saw their faith, he said, <span class="woc">&#8220;Man, your sins are forgiven you.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And the scribes and the Pharisees began to question, saying, &#8220;Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>When Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answered them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Why do you question in your hearts?</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span><span class="woc">Which is easier, to say, &#8216;Your sins are forgiven you,&#8217; or to say, &#8216;Rise and walk&#8217;?</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span><span class="woc">But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins&#8221;</span>&#8212;he said to the man who was paralyzed&#8212;<span class="woc">&#8220;I say to you, rise, pick up your bed and go home.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And immediately he rose up before them and picked up what he had been lying on and went home, glorifying God.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And amazement seized them all, and they glorified God and were filled with awe, saying, &#8220;We have seen extraordinary things today.&#8221;</p>
<p class="heading">Jesus Calls Levi</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>After this he went out and saw a tax collector named Levi, sitting at the tax booth. And he said to him, <span class="woc">&#8220;Follow me.&#8221;</span>

<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And Levi made him a great feast in his house, and there was a large company of tax collectors and others reclining at table with them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And the Pharisees and their scribes grumbled at his disciples, saying, &#8220;Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>And Jesus answered them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.</span>
