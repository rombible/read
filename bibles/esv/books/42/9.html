<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And he said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Take nothing for your journey, no staff, nor bag, nor bread, nor money; and do not have two tunics.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek chiton, a long garment worn under the cloak next to the skin">a</a></sup></span></span>

<p class="heading">Herod Is Perplexed by Jesus</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was happening, and he was perplexed, because it was said by some that John had been raised from the dead,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the prophets of old had risen.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Herod said, &#8220;John I beheaded, but who is this about whom I hear such things?&#8221; And he sought to see him.</p>
<p class="heading">Jesus Feeds the Five Thousand</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>On their return the apostles told him all that they had done. And he took them and withdrew apart to a town called Bethsaida.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>When the crowds learned it, they followed him, and he welcomed them and spoke to them of the kingdom of God and cured those who had need of healing.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now the day began to wear away, and the twelve came and said to him, &#8220;Send the crowd away to go into the surrounding villages and countryside to find lodging and get provisions, for we are here in a desolate place.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>But he said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;You give them something to eat.&#8221;</span> They said, &#8220;We have no more than five loaves and two fish&#8212;unless we are to go and buy food for all these people.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For there were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, <span class="woc">&#8220;Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And they did so, and had them all sit down.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and said a blessing over them. Then he broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And they all ate and were satisfied. And what was left over was picked up, twelve baskets of broken pieces.</p>
<p class="heading">Peter Confesses Jesus as the Christ</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Now it happened that as he was praying alone, the disciples were with him.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And they answered, &#8220;John the Baptist. But others say, Elijah, and others, that one of the prophets of old has risen.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then he said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;But who do you say that I am?&#8221;</span> And Peter answered, &#8220;The Christ of God.&#8221;</p>
<p class="heading">Jesus Foretells His Death</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And he strictly charged and commanded them to tell this to no one,

<p class="heading">Take Up Your Cross and Follow Jesus</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And he said to all, <span class="woc">&#8220;If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.</span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span><span class="woc">For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed when he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span><span class="woc">But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="heading">The Transfiguration</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Now about eight days after these sayings he took with him Peter and John and James and went up on the mountain to pray.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And as he was praying, the appearance of his face was altered, and his clothing became dazzling white.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And behold, two men were talking with him, Moses and Elijah,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>who appeared in glory and spoke of his departure,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek exodus">b</a></sup></span> which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep, but when they became fully awake they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And as the men were parting from him, Peter said to Jesus, &#8220;Master, it is good that we are here.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>As he was saying these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, &#8220;This is my Son, my Chosen One;<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts my Beloved">c</a></sup></span> listen to him!&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>And when the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent and told no one in those days anything of what they had seen.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>While he was coming, the demon threw him to the ground and convulsed him. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.
