<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span><span class="woc">And he called him and said to him, &#8216;What is this that I hear about you? Turn in the account of your management, for you can no longer be manager.&#8217;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span><span class="woc">And the manager said to himself, &#8216;What shall I do, since my master is taking the management away from me? I am not strong enough to dig, and I am ashamed to beg.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span><span class="woc">I have decided what to do, so that when I am removed from management, people may receive me into their houses.&#8217;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span><span class="woc">So, summoning his master&#8217;s debtors one by one, he said to the first, &#8216;How much do you owe my master?&#8217;</span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span><span class="woc">Then he said to another, &#8216;And how much do you owe?&#8217; He said, &#8216;A hundred measures<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Between 1,000 and 1,200 bushels or 37,000 to 45,000 liters">b</a></sup></span> of wheat.&#8217; He said to him, &#8216;Take your bill, and write eighty.&#8217;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><span class="woc">The master commended the dishonest manager for his shrewdness. For the sons of this world<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek age">c</a></sup></span> are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than the sons of light.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span><span class="woc">And I tell you, make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous wealth,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek mammon, a Semitic word for money or possessions; also verse 11; rendered money in verse 13">d</a></sup></span> so that when it fails they may receive you into the eternal dwellings.</span></p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><span class="woc">&#8220;One who is faithful in a very little is also faithful in much, and one who is dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span><span class="woc">If then you have not been faithful in the unrighteous wealth, who will entrust to you the true riches?</span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span><span class="woc">No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="heading">The Law and the Kingdom of God</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these things, and they ridiculed him.
