<div class="chap"><p class="heading">The Resurrection</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they went to the tomb, taking the spices they had prepared.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>but when they went in they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>While they were perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And as they were frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, &#8220;Why do you seek the living among the dead?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>He is not here, but has risen. Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and on the third day rise.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And they remembered his words,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and returning from the tomb they told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Now it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the other women with them who told these things to the apostles,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>but these words seemed to them an idle tale, and they did not believe them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But Peter rose and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths by themselves; and he went home marveling at what had happened.</p>
<p class="heading">On the Road to Emmaus</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>That very day two of them were going to a village named Emmaus, about seven miles<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek sixty stadia; a stadion was about 607 feet or 185 meters">a</a></sup></span> from Jerusalem,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>and they were talking with each other about all these things that had happened.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>While they were talking and discussing together, Jesus himself drew near and went with them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But their eyes were kept from recognizing him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And he said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;What is this conversation that you are holding with each other as you walk?&#8221;</span> And they stood still, looking sad.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered him, &#8220;Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And he said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;What things?&#8221;</span> And they said to him, &#8220;Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, a man who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>and how our chief priests and rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Moreover, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>and when they did not find his body, they came back saying that they had even seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And he said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span><span class="woc">Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>So they drew near to the village to which they were going. He acted as if he were going farther,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>but they urged him strongly, saying, &#8220;Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent.&#8221; So he went in to stay with them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>When he was at table with them, he took the bread and blessed and broke it and gave it to them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>And their eyes were opened, and they recognized him. And he vanished from their sight.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>They said to each other, &#8220;Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the road, while he opened to us the Scriptures?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And they rose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem. And they found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>saying, &#8220;The Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he was known to them in the breaking of the bread.</p>
<p class="heading">Jesus Appears to His Disciples</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>As they were talking about these things, Jesus himself stood among them, and said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Peace to you!&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>But they were startled and frightened and thought they saw a spirit.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>And he said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Why are you troubled, and why do doubts arise in your hearts?</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span><span class="woc">See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Touch me, and see. For a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>And while they still disbelieved for joy and were marveling, he said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Have you anything here to eat?&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>They gave him a piece of broiled fish,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts add and some honeycomb">b</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>and he took it and ate before them.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>Then he said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span>and said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead,</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-47.htm"><b>47</b></a></span><span class="woc">and that repentance for<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts and">c</a></sup></span> the forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem.</span>
