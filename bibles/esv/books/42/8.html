And the twelve were with him,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and also some women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary, called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod&#8217;s household manager, and Susanna, and many others, who provided for them<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts him">a</a></sup></span> out of their means.</p>
<p class="heading">The Parable of the Sower</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And when a great crowd was gathering and people from town after town came to him, he said in a parable,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span><span class="woc">&#8220;A sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some fell along the path and was trampled underfoot, and the birds of the air devoured it.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span><span class="woc">And some fell on the rock, and as it grew up, it withered away, because it had no moisture.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span><span class="woc">And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up with it and choked it.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><span class="woc">And some fell into good soil and grew and yielded a hundredfold.&#8221;</span> As he said these things, he called out, <span class="woc">&#8220;He who has ears to hear, let him hear.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="heading">The Purpose of the Parables</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And when his disciples asked him what this parable meant,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>he said, <span class="woc">&#8220;To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of God, but for others they are in parables, so that &#8216;seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.&#8217;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span><span class="woc">Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span><span class="woc">The ones along the path are those who have heard; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span><span class="woc">And the ones on the rock are those who, when they hear the word, receive it with joy. But these have no root; they believe for a while, and in time of testing fall away.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span><span class="woc">And as for what fell among the thorns, they are those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life, and their fruit does not mature.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span><span class="woc">As for that in the good soil, they are those who, hearing the word, hold it fast in an honest and good heart, and bear fruit with patience.</span></p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span><span class="woc">For nothing is hidden that will not be made manifest, nor is anything secret that will not be known and come to light.</span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>He said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Where is your faith?&#8221;</span> And they were afraid, and they marveled, saying to one another, &#8220;Who then is this, that he commands even winds and water, and they obey him?&#8221;</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. (For many a time it had seized him.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Jesus then asked him, <span class="woc">&#8220;What is your name?&#8221;</span> And he said, &#8220;Legion,&#8221; for many demons had entered him.
