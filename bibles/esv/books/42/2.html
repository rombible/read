<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And all went to be registered, each to his own town.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the town of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David,
