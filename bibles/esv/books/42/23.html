<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Jesus Before Pilate</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Then the whole company of them arose and brought him before Pilate.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And they began to accuse him, saying, &#8220;We found this man misleading our nation and forbidding us to give tribute to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ, a king.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And Pilate asked him, &#8220;Are you the King of the Jews?&#8221; And he answered him, <span class="woc">&#8220;You have said so.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, &#8220;I find no guilt in this man.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But they were urgent, saying, &#8220;He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, from Galilee even to this place.&#8221;</p>
<p class="heading">Jesus Before Herod</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>When Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And when he learned that he belonged to Herod&#8217;s jurisdiction, he sent him over to Herod, who was himself in Jerusalem at that time.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>When Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, for he had long desired to see him, because he had heard about him, and he was hoping to see some sign done by him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So he questioned him at some length, but he made no answer.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>The chief priests and the scribes stood by, vehemently accusing him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And Herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked him. Then, arraying him in splendid clothing, he sent him back to Pilate.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before this they had been at enmity with each other.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Pilate then called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>and said to them, &#8220;You brought me this man as one who was misleading the people. And after examining him before you, behold, I did not find this man guilty of any of your charges against him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Neither did Herod, for he sent him back to us. Look, nothing deserving death has been done by him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>I will therefore punish and release him.&#8221;<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Here, or after verse 19, some manuscripts add verse 17: Now he was obliged to release one man to them at the festival">a</a></sup></span></p>

<p class="heading">Pilate Delivers Jesus to Be Crucified</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>But they all cried out together, &#8220;Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas&#8221;&#8212;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>a man who had been thrown into prison for an insurrection started in the city and for murder.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Pilate addressed them once more, desiring to release Jesus,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>but they kept shouting, &#8220;Crucify, crucify him!&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>A third time he said to them, &#8220;Why? What evil has he done? I have found in him no guilt deserving death. I will therefore punish and release him.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>But they were urgent, demanding with loud cries that he should be crucified. And their voices prevailed.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>So Pilate decided that their demand should be granted.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>He released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but he delivered Jesus over to their will.</p>
<p class="heading">The Crucifixion</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And as they led him away, they seized one Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, and laid on him the cross, to carry it behind Jesus.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And there followed him a great multitude of the people and of women who were mourning and lamenting for him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>But turning to them Jesus said, <span class="woc">&#8220;Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span><span class="woc">For behold, the days are coming when they will say, &#8216;Blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!&#8217;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span><span class="woc">Then they will begin to say to the mountains, &#8216;Fall on us,&#8217; and to the hills, &#8216;Cover us.&#8217;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span><span class="woc">For if they do these things when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Two others, who were criminals, were led away to be put to death with him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And when they came to the place that is called The Skull, there they crucified him, and the criminals, one on his right and one on his left.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>And Jesus said, <span class="woc">&#8220;Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.&#8221;<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts omit the sentence And Jesus... what they do">b</a></sup></span></span> And they cast lots to divide his garments.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>And the people stood by, watching, but the rulers scoffed at him, saying, &#8220;He saved others; let him save himself, if he is the Christ of God, his Chosen One!&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him sour wine
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>and saying, &#8220;If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>There was also an inscription over him,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts add in letters of Greek and Latin and Hebrew">c</a></sup></span> &#8220;This is the King of the Jews.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>One of the criminals who were hanged railed at him,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or blasphemed him">d</a></sup></span> saying, &#8220;Are you not the Christ?

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>But the other rebuked him, saying, &#8220;Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>And we indeed justly, for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>And he said to him, <span class="woc">&#8220;Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise.&#8221;</span></p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>while the sun&#8217;s light failed. And the curtain of the temple was torn in two.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span>Then Jesus, calling out with a loud voice, said, <span class="woc">&#8220;Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!&#8221;</span> And having said this he breathed his last.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-47.htm"><b>47</b></a></span>Now when the centurion saw what had taken place, he praised God, saying, &#8220;Certainly this man was innocent!&#8221;

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-49.htm"><b>49</b></a></span>And all his acquaintances and the women who had followed him from Galilee stood at a distance watching these things.</p>
