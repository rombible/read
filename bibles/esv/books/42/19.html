<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus. He was a chief tax collector and was rich.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And he was seeking to see who Jesus was, but on account of the crowd he could not, because he was small in stature.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was about to pass that way.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, <span class="woc">&#8220;Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, for I must stay at your house today.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So he hurried and came down and received him joyfully.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And when they saw it, they all grumbled, &#8220;He has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, &#8220;Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor. And if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I restore it fourfold.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And Jesus said to him, <span class="woc">&#8220;Today salvation has come to this house, since he also is a son of Abraham.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><span class="woc">For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.&#8221;</span></p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>He said therefore, <span class="woc">&#8220;A nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and then return.</span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span><span class="woc">But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, &#8216;We do not want this man to reign over us.&#8217;</span>
