<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And when they came to Jesus, they pleaded with him earnestly, saying, &#8220;He is worthy to have you do this for him,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>for he loves our nation, and he is the one who built us our synagogue.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And Jesus went with them. When he was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends, saying to him, &#8220;Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Therefore I did not presume to come to you. But say the word, and let my servant be healed.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For I too am a man set under authority, with soldiers under me: and I say to one, &#8216;Go,&#8217; and he goes; and to another, &#8216;Come,&#8217; and he comes; and to my servant, &#8216;Do this,&#8217; and he does it.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turning to the crowd that followed him, said, <span class="woc">&#8220;I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such faith.&#8221;</span>
