<div class="chap"><p class="heading">The Parable of the Lost Sheep</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Now the tax collectors and sinners were all drawing near to hear him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And the Pharisees and the scribes grumbled, saying, &#8220;This man receives sinners and eats with them.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So he told them this parable:
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span><span class="woc">&#8220;What man of you, having a hundred sheep, if he has lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the open country, and go after the one that is lost, until he finds it?</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span><span class="woc">And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span><span class="woc">And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, &#8216;Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep that was lost.&#8217;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span><span class="woc">Just so, I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance.</span></p>
<p class="heading">The Parable of the Lost Coin</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><span class="woc">&#8220;Or what woman, having ten silver coins,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek ten drachmas; a drachma was a Greek coin approximately equal in value to a Roman denarius, worth about a day's wage for a laborer">a</a></sup></span> if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek diligently until she finds it?</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span><span class="woc">And when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, &#8216;Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin that I had lost.&#8217;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><span class="woc">Just so, I tell you, there is joy before the angels of God over one sinner who repents.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="heading">The Parable of the Prodigal Son</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And he said, <span class="woc">&#8220;There was a man who had two sons.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span><span class="woc">And the younger of them said to his father, &#8216;Father, give me the share of property that is coming to me.&#8217; And he divided his property between them.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span><span class="woc">Not many days later, the younger son gathered all he had and took a journey into a far country, and there he squandered his property in reckless living.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span><span class="woc">And when he had spent everything, a severe famine arose in that country, and he began to be in need.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span><span class="woc">So he went and hired himself out to<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek joined himself to">b</a></sup></span> one of the citizens of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed pigs.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span><span class="woc">And he was longing to be fed with the pods that the pigs ate, and no one gave him anything.</span></p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span><span class="woc">&#8220;But when he came to himself, he said, &#8216;How many of my father&#8217;s hired servants have more than enough bread, but I perish here with hunger!</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span><span class="woc">I will arise and go to my father, and I will say to him, &#8220;Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span><span class="woc">I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Treat me as one of your hired servants.&#8221;&#8217;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span><span class="woc">And he arose and came to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt compassion, and ran and embraced him and kissed him.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span><span class="woc">And the son said to him, &#8216;Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span><span class="woc">But the father said to his servants,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or bondservants">d</a></sup></span> &#8216;Bring quickly the best robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span><span class="woc">And bring the fattened calf and kill it, and let us eat and celebrate.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span><span class="woc">For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.&#8217; And they began to celebrate.</span></p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span><span class="woc">&#8220;Now his older son was in the field, and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span><span class="woc">And he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span><span class="woc">And he said to him, &#8216;Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has received him back safe and sound.&#8217;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span><span class="woc">But he was angry and refused to go in. His father came out and entreated him,</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span><span class="woc">but he answered his father, &#8216;Look, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed your command, yet you never gave me a young goat, that I might celebrate with my friends.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span><span class="woc">But when this son of yours came, who has devoured your property with prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him!&#8217;</span>
