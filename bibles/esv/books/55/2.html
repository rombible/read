<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, the offspring of David, as preached in my gospel,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>for which I am suffering, bound with chains as a criminal. But the word of God is not bound!
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But avoid irreverent babble, for it will lead people into more and more ungodliness,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>and their talk will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>who have swerved from the truth, saying that the resurrection has already happened. They are upsetting the faith of some.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>But God&#8217;s firm foundation stands, bearing this seal: &#8220;The Lord knows those who are his,&#8221; and, &#8220;Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity.&#8221;</p>
