<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money, proud, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>heartless, unappeasable, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not loving good,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>treacherous, reckless, swollen with conceit, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>having the appearance of godliness, but denying its power. Avoid such people.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>For among them are those who creep into households and capture weak women, burdened with sins and led astray by various passions,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>always learning and never able to arrive at a knowledge of the truth.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men also oppose the truth, men corrupted in mind and disqualified regarding the faith.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But they will not get very far, for their folly will be plain to all, as was that of those two men.</p>
