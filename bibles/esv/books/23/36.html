<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Sennacherib Invades Judah</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and took them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And the king of Assyria sent the Rabshakeh<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Rabshakeh is the title of a high-ranking Assyrian military officer">a</a></sup></span> from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem, with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool on the highway to the Washer&#8217;s Field.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And there came out to him Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the secretary, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And the Rabshakeh said to them, &#8220;Say to Hezekiah, &#8216;Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria: On what do you rest this trust of yours?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Do you think that mere words are strategy and power for war? In whom do you now trust, that you have rebelled against me?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Behold, you are trusting in Egypt, that broken reed of a staff, which will pierce the hand of any man who leans on it. Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But if you say to me, &#8220;We trust in the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> our God,&#8221; is it not he whose high places and altars Hezekiah has removed, saying to Judah and to Jerusalem, &#8220;You shall worship before this altar&#8221;?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Come now, make a wager with my master the king of Assyria: I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders on them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>How then can you repulse a single captain among the least of my master&#8217;s servants, when you trust in Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Moreover, is it without the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> that I have come up against this land to destroy it? The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to me, &#8220;Go up against this land and destroy it.&#8221;&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to the Rabshakeh, &#8220;Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it. Do not speak to us in the language of Judah within the hearing of the people who are on the wall.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But the Rabshakeh said, &#8220;Has my master sent me to speak these words to your master and to you, and not to the men sitting on the wall, who are doomed with you to eat their own dung and drink their own urine?&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then the Rabshakeh stood and called out in a loud voice in the language of Judah: &#8220;Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria!
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Thus says the king: &#8216;Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Do not let Hezekiah make you trust in the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> by saying, &#8220;The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> will surely deliver us. This city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Do not listen to Hezekiah. For thus says the king of Assyria: Make your peace with me<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew Make a blessing with me">b</a></sup></span> and come out to me. Then each one of you will eat of his own vine, and each one of his own fig tree, and each one of you will drink the water of his own cistern,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Beware lest Hezekiah mislead you by saying, &#8220;The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> will deliver us.&#8221; Has any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Who among all the gods of these lands have delivered their lands out of my hand, that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>But they were silent and answered him not a word, for the king&#8217;s command was, &#8220;Do not answer him.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the secretary, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him the words of the Rabshakeh.</p><A name="footnotes"></a><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">2</span> Rabshakeh</i> is the title of a high-ranking Assyrian military officer<br /><span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">16</span> Hebrew <i><span class="catch-word">Make</span> a blessing with me</i><br /></span></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
