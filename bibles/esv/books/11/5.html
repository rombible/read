<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Solomon sent word to Hiram,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8220;You know that David my father could not build a house for the name of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> his God because of the warfare with which his enemies surrounded him, until the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> put them under the soles of his feet.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But now the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> my God has given me rest on every side. There is neither adversary nor misfortune.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And so I intend to build a house for the name of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> my God, as the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to David my father, &#8216;Your son, whom I will set on your throne in your place, shall build the house for my name.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now therefore command that cedars of Lebanon be cut for me. And my servants will join your servants, and I will pay you for your servants such wages as you set, for you know that there is no one among us who knows how to cut timber like the Sidonians.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>As soon as Hiram heard the words of Solomon, he rejoiced greatly and said, &#8220;Blessed be the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> this day, who has given to David a wise son to be over this great people.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, &#8220;I have heard the message that you have sent to me. I am ready to do all you desire in the matter of cedar and cypress timber.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>My servants shall bring it down to the sea from Lebanon, and I will make it into rafts to go by sea to the place you direct. And I will have them broken up there, and you shall receive it. And you shall meet my wishes by providing food for my household.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So Hiram supplied Solomon with all the timber of cedar and cypress that he desired,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>while Solomon gave Hiram 20,000 cors<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="A cor was about 6 bushels or 220 liters">b</a></sup></span> of wheat as food for his household, and 20,000<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Septuagint; Hebrew twenty">c</a></sup></span> cors of beaten oil. Solomon gave this to Hiram year by year.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him. And there was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and the two of them made a treaty.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>King Solomon drafted forced labor out of all Israel, and the draft numbered 30,000 men.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And he sent them to Lebanon, 10,000 a month in shifts. They would be a month in Lebanon and two months at home. Adoniram was in charge of the draft.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Solomon also had 70,000 burden-bearers and 80,000 stonecutters in the hill country,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>besides Solomon&#8217;s 3,300 chief officers who were over the work, who had charge of the people who carried on the work.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>At the king&#8217;s command they quarried out great, costly stones in order to lay the foundation of the house with dressed stones.
