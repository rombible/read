<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>He reigned for three years in Jerusalem. His mother&#8217;s name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And he walked in all the sins that his father did before him, and his heart was not wholly true to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> his God, as the heart of David his father.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Nevertheless, for David&#8217;s sake the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, setting up his son after him, and establishing Jerusalem,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>because David did what was right in the eyes of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and did not turn aside from anything that he commanded him all the days of his life, except in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>The rest of the acts of Abijam and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And Abijam slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David. And Asa his son reigned in his place.</p>
<p class="heading">Asa Reigns in Judah</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>In the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Asa began to reign over Judah,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and he reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem. His mother&#8217;s name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And Asa did what was right in the eyes of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, as David his father had done.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>He put away the male cult prostitutes out of the land and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>He also removed Maacah his mother from being queen mother because she had made an abominable image for Asherah. And Asa cut down her image and burned it at the brook Kidron.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But the high places were not taken away. Nevertheless, the heart of Asa was wholly true to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> all his days.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And he brought into the house of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> the sacred gifts of his father and his own sacred gifts, silver, and gold, and vessels.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah and built Ramah, that he might permit no one to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and the treasures of the king&#8217;s house and gave them into the hands of his servants. And King Asa sent them to Ben-hadad the son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, who lived in Damascus, saying,

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And Ben-hadad listened to King Asa and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel and conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel-beth-maacah, and all Chinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And when Baasha heard of it, he stopped building Ramah, and he lived in Tirzah.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then King Asa made a proclamation to all Judah, none was exempt, and they carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber, with which Baasha had been building, and with them King Asa built Geba of Benjamin and Mizpah.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Now the rest of all the acts of Asa, all his might, and all that he did, and the cities that he built, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And Asa slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father, and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>So Baasha killed him in the third year of Asa king of Judah and reigned in his place.
