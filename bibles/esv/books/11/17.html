<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> came to him:
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8220;Depart from here and turn eastward and hide yourself by the brook Cherith, which is east of the Jordan.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>You shall drink from the brook, and I have commanded the ravens to feed you there.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So he went and did according to the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. He went and lived by the brook Cherith that is east of the Jordan.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And the ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning, and bread and meat in the evening, and he drank from the brook.

<p class="heading">The Widow of Zarephath</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> came to him,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;Arise, go to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and dwell there. Behold, I have commanded a widow there to feed you.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks. And he called to her and said, &#8220;Bring me a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And as she was going to bring it, he called to her and said, &#8220;Bring me a morsel of bread in your hand.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And she said, &#8220;As the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God lives, I have nothing baked, only a handful of flour in a jar and a little oil in a jug.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And Elijah said to her, &#8220;Do not fear; go and do as you have said. But first make me a little cake of it and bring it to me, and afterward make something for yourself and your son.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, &#8216;The jar of flour shall not be spent, and the jug of oil shall not be empty, until the day that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> sends rain upon the earth.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And she went and did as Elijah said. And she and he and her household ate for many days.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>The jar of flour was not spent, neither did the jug of oil become empty, according to the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> that he spoke by Elijah.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And he cried to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, &#8220;O <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> my God, have you brought calamity even upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by killing her son?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then he stretched himself upon the child three times and cried to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, &#8220;O <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> my God, let this child&#8217;s life<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or soul; also verse 22">b</a></sup></span> come into him again.&#8221;
