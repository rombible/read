<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And after this Ahab said to Naboth, &#8220;Give me your vineyard, that I may have it for a vegetable garden, because it is near my house, and I will give you a better vineyard for it; or, if it seems good to you, I will give you its value in money.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But Naboth said to Ahab, &#8220;The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> forbid that I should give you the inheritance of my fathers.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And Ahab went into his house vexed and sullen because of what Naboth the Jezreelite had said to him, for he had said, &#8220;I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers.&#8221; And he lay down on his bed and turned away his face and would eat no food.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But Jezebel his wife came to him and said to him, &#8220;Why is your spirit so vexed that you eat no food?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And he said to her, &#8220;Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite and said to him, &#8216;Give me your vineyard for money, or else, if it please you, I will give you another vineyard for it.&#8217; And he answered, &#8216;I will not give you my vineyard.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And Jezebel his wife said to him, &#8220;Do you now govern Israel? Arise and eat bread and let your heart be cheerful; I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So she wrote letters in Ahab&#8217;s name and sealed them with his seal, and she sent the letters to the elders and the leaders who lived with Naboth in his city.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And she wrote in the letters, &#8220;Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth at the head of the people.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And set two worthless men opposite him, and let them bring a charge against him, saying, &#8216;You have cursed<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew blessed; also verse 13">a</a></sup></span> God and the king.&#8217; Then take him out and stone him to death.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And the men of his city, the elders and the leaders who lived in his city, did as Jezebel had sent word to them. As it was written in the letters that she had sent to them,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>they proclaimed a fast and set Naboth at the head of the people.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And the two worthless men came in and sat opposite him. And the worthless men brought a charge against Naboth in the presence of the people, saying, &#8220;Naboth cursed God and the king.&#8221; So they took him outside the city and stoned him to death with stones.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, &#8220;Naboth has been stoned; he is dead.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>As soon as Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, Jezebel said to Ahab, &#8220;Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money, for Naboth is not alive, but dead.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And as soon as Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, Ahab arose to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And you shall say to him, &#8216;Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, &#8220;Have you killed and also taken possession?&#8221;&#8217; And you shall say to him, &#8216;Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8220;In the place where dogs licked up the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick your own blood.&#8221;&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Ahab said to Elijah, &#8220;Have you found me, O my enemy?&#8221; He answered, &#8220;I have found you, because you have sold yourself to do what is evil in the sight of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Behold, I will bring disaster upon you. I will utterly burn you up, and will cut off from Ahab every male, bond or free, in Israel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the anger to which you have provoked me, and because you have made Israel to sin.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And of Jezebel the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> also said, &#8216;The dogs shall eat Jezebel within the walls of Jezreel.&#8217;
