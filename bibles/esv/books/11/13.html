Jeroboam was standing by the altar to make offerings.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And the man cried against the altar by the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and said, &#8220;O altar, altar, thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8216;Behold, a son shall be born to the house of David, Josiah by name, and he shall sacrifice on you the priests of the high places who make offerings on you, and human bones shall be burned on you.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And he gave a sign the same day, saying, &#8220;This is the sign that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has spoken: &#8216;Behold, the altar shall be torn down, and the ashes that are on it shall be poured out.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And when the king heard the saying of the man of God, which he cried against the altar at Bethel, Jeroboam stretched out his hand from the altar, saying, &#8220;Seize him.&#8221; And his hand, which he stretched out against him, dried up, so that he could not draw it back to himself.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>The altar also was torn down, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign that the man of God had given by the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And the king said to the man of God, &#8220;Entreat now the favor of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored to me.&#8221; And the man of God entreated the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and the king&#8217;s hand was restored to him and became as it was before.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And the king said to the man of God, &#8220;Come home with me, and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And the man of God said to the king, &#8220;If you give me half your house, I will not go in with you. And I will not eat bread or drink water in this place,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>for so was it commanded me by the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, saying, &#8216;You shall neither eat bread nor drink water nor return by the way that you came.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So he went another way and did not return by the way that he came to Bethel.</p>
<p class="heading">The Prophet&#8217;s Disobedience</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now an old prophet lived in Bethel. And his sons<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Septuagint, Syriac, Vulgate; Hebrew son">a</a></sup></span> came and told him all that the man of God had done that day in Bethel. They also told to their father the words that he had spoken to the king.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And their father said to them, &#8220;Which way did he go?&#8221; And his sons showed him the way that the man of God who came from Judah had gone.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And he said to his sons, &#8220;Saddle the donkey for me.&#8221; So they saddled the donkey for him and he mounted it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And he went after the man of God and found him sitting under an oak. And he said to him, &#8220;Are you the man of God who came from Judah?&#8221; And he said, &#8220;I am.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then he said to him, &#8220;Come home with me and eat bread.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;I may not return with you, or go in with you, neither will I eat bread nor drink water with you in this place,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>for it was said to me by the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, &#8216;You shall neither eat bread nor drink water there, nor return by the way that you came.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And he said to him, &#8220;I also am a prophet as you are, and an angel spoke to me by the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, saying, &#8216;Bring him back with you into your house that he may eat bread and drink water.&#8217;&#8221; But he lied to him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>So he went back with him and ate bread in his house and drank water.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And as they sat at the table, the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> came to the prophet who had brought him back.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>but have come back and have eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which he said to you, &#8220;Eat no bread and drink no water,&#8221; your body shall not come to the tomb of your fathers.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And after he had eaten bread and drunk, he saddled the donkey for the prophet whom he had brought back.
