<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, &#8220;So may the gods do to me and more also, if I do not make your life as the life of one of them by this time tomorrow.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then he was afraid, and he arose and ran for his life and came to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah, and left his servant there.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But he himself went a day&#8217;s journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a broom tree. And he asked that he might die, saying, &#8220;It is enough; now, O <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, take away my life, for I am no better than my fathers.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And he lay down and slept under a broom tree. And behold, an angel touched him and said to him, &#8220;Arise and eat.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And he looked, and behold, there was at his head a cake baked on hot stones and a jar of water. And he ate and drank and lay down again.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And the angel of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> came again a second time and touched him and said, &#8220;Arise and eat, for the journey is too great for you.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And he arose and ate and drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb, the mount of God.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>He said, &#8220;I have been very jealous for the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of hosts.
