<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Therefore his servants said to him, &#8220;Let a young woman be sought for my lord the king, and let her wait on the king and be in his service. Let her lie in your arms,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or in your bosom">a</a></sup></span> that my lord the king may be warm.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So they sought for a beautiful young woman throughout all the territory of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>The young woman was very beautiful, and she was of service to the king and attended to him, but the king knew her not.</p>
<p class="heading">Adonijah Sets Himself Up as King</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, &#8220;I will be king.&#8221; And he prepared for himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.

<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Adonijah sacrificed sheep, oxen, and fattened cattle by the Serpent&#8217;s Stone, which is beside En-rogel, and he invited all his brothers, the king&#8217;s sons, and all the royal officials of Judah,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>but he did not invite Nathan the prophet or Benaiah or the mighty men or Solomon his brother.</p>
<p class="heading">Nathan and Bathsheba Before David</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then Nathan said to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, &#8220;Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith has become king and David our lord does not know it?

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Go in at once to King David, and say to him, &#8216;Did you not, my lord the king, swear to your servant, saying, &#8220;Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne&#8221;? Why then is Adonijah king?&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then while you are still speaking with the king, I also will come in after you and confirm<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or expand on">b</a></sup></span> your words.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So Bathsheba went to the king in his chamber (now the king was very old, and Abishag the Shunammite was attending to the king).
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Bathsheba bowed and paid homage to the king, and the king said, &#8220;What do you desire?&#8221;

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>But me, your servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon he has not invited.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the ground and paid homage to the king and said, &#8220;May my lord King David live forever!&#8221;</p>
