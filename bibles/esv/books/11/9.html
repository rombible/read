<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> appeared to Solomon a second time, as he had appeared to him at Gibeon.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to him, &#8220;I have heard your prayer and your plea, which you have made before me.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And as for you, if you will walk before me, as David your father walked, with integrity of heart and uprightness, doing according to all that I have commanded you, and keeping my statutes and my rules,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>then I will establish your royal throne over Israel forever, as I promised David your father, saying, &#8216;You shall not lack a man on the throne of Israel.&#8217;

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then they will say, &#8216;Because they abandoned the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> their God who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt and laid hold on other gods and worshiped them and served them.
