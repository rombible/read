<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Since I exalted you out of the dust and made you leader over my people Israel, and you have walked in the way of Jeroboam and have made my people Israel to sin, provoking me to anger with their sins,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>behold, I will utterly sweep away Baasha and his house, and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Anyone belonging to Baasha who dies in the city the dogs shall eat, and anyone of his who dies in the field the birds of the heavens shall eat.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now the rest of the acts of Baasha and what he did, and his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And Baasha slept with his fathers and was buried at Tirzah, and Elah his son reigned in his place.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Moreover, the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> came by the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha and his house, both because of all the evil that he did in the sight of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam, and also because he destroyed it.</p>
<p class="heading">Elah Reigns in Israel</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah the son of Baasha began to reign over Israel in Tirzah, and he reigned two years.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But his servant Zimri, commander of half his chariots, conspired against him. When he was at Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, who was over the household in Tirzah,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Zimri came in and struck him down and killed him, in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his place.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>When he began to reign, as soon as he had seated himself on his throne, he struck down all the house of Baasha. He did not leave him a single male of his relatives or his friends.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Thus Zimri destroyed all the house of Baasha, according to the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, which he spoke against Baasha by Jehu the prophet,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>for all the sins of Baasha and the sins of Elah his son, which they sinned and which they made Israel to sin, provoking the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel to anger with their idols.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Now the rest of the acts of Elah and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</p>
<p class="heading">Zimri Reigns in Israel</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, Zimri reigned seven days in Tirzah. Now the troops were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>and the troops who were encamped heard it said, &#8220;Zimri has conspired, and he has killed the king.&#8221; Therefore all Israel made Omri, the commander of the army, king over Israel that day in the camp.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And when Zimri saw that the city was taken, he went into the citadel of the king&#8217;s house and burned the king&#8217;s house over him with fire and died,
