<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>but he is under guardians and managers until the date set by his father.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>In the same way we also, when we were children, were enslaved to the elementary principles<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or elemental spirits; also verse 9">b</a></sup></span> of the world.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, &#8220;Abba! Father!&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So you are no longer a slave, but a son, and if a son, then an heir through God.</p>
<p class="heading">Paul&#8217;s Concern for the Galatians</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Formerly, when you did not know God, you were enslaved to those that by nature are not gods.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how can you turn back again to the weak and worthless elementary principles of the world, whose slaves you want to be once more?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>You observe days and months and seasons and years!
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>I am afraid I may have labored over you in vain.</p>

You did me no wrong.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>You know it was because of a bodily ailment that I preached the gospel to you at first,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>and though my condition was a trial to you, you did not scorn or despise me, but received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>What then has become of your blessedness? For I testify to you that, if possible, you would have gouged out your eyes and given them to me.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Have I then become your enemy by telling you the truth?<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or by dealing truthfully with you">d</a></sup></span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>It is always good to be made much of for a good purpose, and not only when I am present with you,

<p class="heading">Example of Hagar and Sarah</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you not listen to the law?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by a slave woman and one by a free woman.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>But the son of the slave was born according to the flesh, while the son of the free woman was born through promise.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Now this may be interpreted allegorically: these women are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai, bearing children for slavery; she is Hagar.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia;<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts For Sinai is a mountain in Arabia">e</a></sup></span> she corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>For it is written,</p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">&#8220;Rejoice, O barren one who does not bear;</span><br /><span class="indent">break forth and cry aloud, you who are not in labor!</span><br /><span class="ln-group">For the children of the desolate one will be more</span><br /><span class="indent">than those of the one who has a husband.&#8221;</span></p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>But just as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so also it is now.
