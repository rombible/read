Keep watch on yourself, lest you too be tempted.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Bear one another&#8217;s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For if anyone thinks he is something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But let each one test his own work, and then his reason to boast will be in himself alone and not in his neighbor.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For each will have to bear his own load.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Let the one who is taught the word share all good things with the one who teaches.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Do not be deceived: God is not mocked, for whatever one sows, that will he also reap.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption, but the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap, if we do not give up.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So then, as we have opportunity, let us do good to everyone, and especially to those who are of the household of faith.</p>
<p class="heading">Final Warning and Benediction</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>See with what large letters I am writing to you with my own hand.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>It is those who want to make a good showing in the flesh who would force you to be circumcised, and only in order that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For even those who are circumcised do not themselves keep the law, but they desire to have you circumcised that they may boast in your flesh.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or through whom">b</a></sup></span> the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>For neither circumcision counts for anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And as for all who walk by this rule, peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>From now on let no one cause me trouble, for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers.
