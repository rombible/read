<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Greeting</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Paul, an apostle&#8212;not from men nor through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead&#8212;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and all the brothers<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or brothers and sisters. In New Testament usage, depending on the context, the plural Greek word adelphoi (translated brothers) may refer either to brothers or to brothers and sisters; also verse 11">a</a></sup></span> who are with me,</p><p class="regular">To the churches of Galatia:</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>who gave himself for our sins to deliver us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="heading">No Other Gospel</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel&#8212;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>not that there is another one, but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For am I now seeking the approval of man, or of God? Or am I trying to please man? If I were still trying to please man, I would not be a servant<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="For the contextual rendering of the Greek word doulos, see Preface">b</a></sup></span> of Christ.</p>
<p class="heading">Paul Called by God</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For I would have you know, brothers, that the gospel that was preached by me is not man&#8217;s gospel.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek not according to man">c</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>For I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For you have heard of my former life in Judaism, how I persecuted the church of God violently and tried to destroy it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people, so extremely zealous was I for the traditions of my fathers.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But when he who had set me apart before I was born,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek set me apart from my mother's womb">d</a></sup></span> and who called me by his grace,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>was pleased to reveal his Son to<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek in">e</a></sup></span> me, in order that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with anyone;<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek with flesh and blood">f</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas and remained with him fifteen days.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>But I saw none of the other apostles except James the Lord&#8217;s brother.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>(In what I am writing to you, before God, I do not lie!)
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And I was still unknown in person to the churches of Judea that are in Christ.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>They only were hearing it said, &#8220;He who used to persecute us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy.&#8221;
