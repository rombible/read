<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>There is one body and one Spirit&#8212;just as you were called to the one hope that belongs to your call&#8212;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>one Lord, one faith, one baptism,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But grace was given to each one of us according to the measure of Christ&#8217;s gift.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Therefore it says,</p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">&#8220;When he ascended on high he led a host of captives,</span><br /><span class="indent">and he gave gifts to men.&#8221;<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="The Greek word anthropoi can refer to both men and women">a</a></sup></span></span></p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>He who descended is the one who also ascended far above all the heavens, that he might fill all things.)
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or pastors">c</a></sup></span> and teachers,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or the shepherd-teachers">d</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek to a full-grown man">e</a></sup></span> to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>so that we may no longer be children, tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness in deceitful schemes.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>from whom the whole body, joined and held together by every joint with which it is equipped, when each part is working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love.</p>
<p class="heading">The New Life</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Now this I say and testify in the Lord, that you must no longer walk as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their minds.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>They are darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, due to their hardness of heart.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>They have become callous and have given themselves up to sensuality, greedy to practice every kind of impurity.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>But that is not the way you learned Christ!&#8212;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>assuming that you have heard about him and were taught in him, as the truth is in Jesus,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>to put off your old self,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek man; also verse 24">f</a></sup></span> which belongs to your former manner of life and is corrupt through deceitful desires,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>and to be renewed in the spirit of your minds,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>and to put on the new self, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Therefore, having put away falsehood, let each one of you speak the truth with his neighbor, for we are members one of another.
