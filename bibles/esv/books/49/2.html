<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience&#8212;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek flesh">a</a></sup></span> and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek like the rest">b</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or And">c</a></sup></span> God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ&#8212;by grace you have been saved&#8212;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>not a result of works, so that no one may boast.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.</p>
<p class="heading">One in Christ</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Therefore remember that at one time you Gentiles in the flesh, called &#8220;the uncircumcision&#8221; by what is called the circumcision, which is made in the flesh by hands&#8212;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>remember that you were at that time separated from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For he himself is our peace, who has made us both one and has broken down in his flesh the dividing wall of hostility
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>by abolishing the law of commandments expressed in ordinances, that he might create in himself one new man in place of the two, so making peace,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>and might reconcile us both to God in one body through the cross, thereby killing the hostility.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And he came and preached peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>For through him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father.
