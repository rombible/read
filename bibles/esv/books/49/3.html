<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>assuming that you have heard of the stewardship of God&#8217;s grace that was given to me for you,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>how the mystery was made known to me by revelation, as I have written briefly.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>When you read this, you can perceive my insight into the mystery of Christ,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>which was not made known to the sons of men in other generations as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit.

<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Of this gospel I was made a minister according to the gift of God&#8217;s grace, which was given me by the working of his power.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>To me, though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places.
