<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Honor your father and mother&#8221; (this is the first commandment with a promise),

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>In all circumstances take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming darts of the evil one;
