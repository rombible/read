<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Greeting</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philemon/1-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Paul, a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother,</p><p class="regular">To Philemon our beloved fellow worker
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philemon/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and Apphia our sister and Archippus our fellow soldier, and the church in your house:</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philemon/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="heading">Philemon&#8217;s Love and Faith</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philemon/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>I thank my God always when I remember you in my prayers,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philemon/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>because I hear of your love and of the faith that you have toward the Lord Jesus and for all the saints,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philemon/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective for the full knowledge of every good thing that is in us for the sake of Christ.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or for Christ's service">a</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philemon/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For I have derived much joy and comfort from your love, my brother, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you.</p>
<p class="heading">Paul&#8217;s Plea for Onesimus</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philemon/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Accordingly, though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do what is required,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philemon/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>yet for love&#8217;s sake I prefer to appeal to you&#8212;I, Paul, an old man and now a prisoner also for Christ Jesus&#8212;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philemon/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>I appeal to you for my child, Onesimus,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Onesimus means useful (see verse 11) or beneficial (see verse 20)">b</a></sup></span> whose father I became in my imprisonment.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philemon/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>(Formerly he was useless to you, but now he is indeed useful to you and to me.)
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philemon/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>I am sending him back to you, sending my very heart.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philemon/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>I would have been glad to keep him with me, in order that he might serve me on your behalf during my imprisonment for the gospel,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philemon/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>but I preferred to do nothing without your consent in order that your goodness might not be by compulsion but of your own accord.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philemon/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>For this perhaps is why he was parted from you for a while, that you might have him back forever,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philemon/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>no longer as a bondservant<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="For the contextual rendering of the Greek word doulos, see Preface; twice in this verse">c</a></sup></span> but more than a bondservant, as a beloved brother&#8212;especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philemon/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So if you consider me your partner, receive him as you would receive me.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philemon/1-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>If he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, charge that to my account.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philemon/1-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it&#8212;to say nothing of your owing me even your own self.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philemon/1-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Yes, brother, I want some benefit from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philemon/1-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philemon/1-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>At the same time, prepare a guest room for me, for I am hoping that through your prayers I will be graciously given to you.</p>
<p class="heading">Final Greetings</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philemon/1-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends greetings to you,
