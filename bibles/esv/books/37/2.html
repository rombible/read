<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to all the remnant of the people, and say,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8216;Who is left among you who saw this house in its former glory? How do you see it now? Is it not as nothing in your eyes?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, declares the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. Be strong, O Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest. Be strong, all you people of the land, declares the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. Work, for I am with you, declares the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>according to the covenant that I made with you when you came out of Egypt. My Spirit remains in your midst. Fear not.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>For thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts: Yet once more, in a little while, I will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And I will shake all nations, so that the treasures of all nations shall come in, and I will fill this house with glory, says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, declares the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>The latter glory of this house shall be greater than the former, says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8220;Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts: Ask the priests about the law:
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>&#8216;If someone carries holy meat in the fold of his garment and touches with his fold bread or stew or wine or oil or any kind of food, does it become holy?&#8217;&#8221; The priests answered and said, &#8220;No.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then Haggai said, &#8220;If someone who is unclean by contact with a dead body touches any of these, does it become unclean?&#8221; The priests answered and said, &#8220;It does become unclean.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then Haggai answered and said, &#8220;So is it with this people, and with this nation before me, declares the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and so with every work of their hands. And what they offer there is unclean.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/2-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Consider from this day onward, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month. Since the day that the foundation of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s temple was laid, consider:
