<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts: These people say the time has not yet come to rebuild the house of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> came by the hand of Haggai the prophet,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8220;Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your paneled houses, while this house lies in ruins?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now, therefore, thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts: Consider your ways.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>You have sown much, and harvested little. You eat, but you never have enough; you drink, but you never have your fill. You clothe yourselves, but no one is warm. And he who earns wages does so to put them into a bag with holes.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8220;Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts: Consider your ways.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Go up to the hills and bring wood and build the house, that I may take pleasure in it and that I may be glorified, says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>You looked for much, and behold, it came to little. And when you brought it home, I blew it away. Why? declares the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts. Because of my house that lies in ruins, while each of you busies himself with his own house.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Therefore the heavens above you have withheld the dew, and the earth has withheld its produce.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And I have called for a drought on the land and the hills, on the grain, the new wine, the oil, on what the ground brings forth, on man and beast, and on all their labors.&#8221;</p>

And the people feared the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then Haggai, the messenger of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, spoke to the people with the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s message, &#8220;I am with you, declares the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people.
