<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region about the Jordan were going out to him,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, &#8220;You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And do not presume to say to yourselves, &#8216;We have Abraham as our father,&#8217; for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8220;I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.&#8221;</p>
<p class="heading">The Baptism of Jesus</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him.
