<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span><span class="woc">it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth; this defiles a person.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then the disciples came and said to him, &#8220;Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>He answered, <span class="woc">&#8220;Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up.</span>

<p class="heading">The Faith of a Canaanite Woman</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And Jesus went away from there and withdrew to the district of Tyre and Sidon.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And behold, a Canaanite woman from that region came out and was crying, &#8220;Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David; my daughter is severely oppressed by a demon.&#8221;

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>He answered, <span class="woc">&#8220;I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.&#8221;</span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And he answered, <span class="woc">&#8220;It is not right to take the children&#8217;s bread and throw it to the dogs.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>She said, &#8220;Yes, Lord, yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters&#8217; table.&#8221;

<p class="heading">Jesus Feeds the Four Thousand</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, <span class="woc">&#8220;I have compassion on the crowd because they have been with me now three days and have nothing to eat.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And the disciples said to him, &#8220;Where are we to get enough bread in such a desolate place to feed so great a crowd?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>And Jesus said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;How many loaves do you have?&#8221;</span> They said, &#8220;Seven, and a few small fish.&#8221;
