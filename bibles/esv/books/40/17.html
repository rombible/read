<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became white as light.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elijah, talking with him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And Peter said to Jesus, &#8220;Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will make three tents here, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>He was still speaking when, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, &#8220;This is my beloved Son,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or my Son, my (or the) Beloved">a</a></sup></span> with whom I am well pleased; listen to him.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>When the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces and were terrified.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But Jesus came and touched them, saying, <span class="woc">&#8220;Rise, and have no fear.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus only.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And as they were coming down the mountain, Jesus commanded them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Tell no one the vision, until the Son of Man is raised from the dead.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And the disciples asked him, &#8220;Then why do the scribes say that first Elijah must come?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>He answered, <span class="woc">&#8220;Elijah does come, and he will restore all things.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span><span class="woc">But I tell you that Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they pleased. So also the Son of Man will certainly suffer at their hands.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them of John the Baptist.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>said, &#8220;Lord, have mercy on my son, for he has seizures and he suffers terribly. For often he falls into the fire, and often into the water.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And I brought him to your disciples, and they could not heal him.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And Jesus answered, <span class="woc">&#8220;O faithless and twisted generation, how long am I to be with you? How long am I to bear with you? Bring him here to me.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And Jesus rebuked the demon,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek it">b</a></sup></span> and it<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek the demon">c</a></sup></span> came out of him, and the boy was healed instantly.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek from that hour">d</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, &#8220;Why could we not cast it out?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>He said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Because of your little faith.
