His disciples were hungry, and they began to pluck heads of grain and to eat.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>But when the Pharisees saw it, they said to him, &#8220;Look, your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>He said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him:</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span><span class="woc">how he entered the house of God and ate the bread of the Presence, which it was not lawful for him to eat nor for those who were with him, but only for the priests?</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span><span class="woc">Or have you not read in the Law how on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless?</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span><span class="woc">I tell you, something greater than the temple is here.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span><span class="woc">And if you had known what this means, &#8216;I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,&#8217; you would not have condemned the guiltless.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><span class="woc">For the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.&#8221;</span></p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And a man was there with a withered hand. And they asked him, &#8220;Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?&#8221;&#8212;so that they might accuse him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>He said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Which one of you who has a sheep, if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it out?</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span><span class="woc">Of how much more value is a man than a sheep! So it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then he said to the man, <span class="woc">&#8220;Stretch out your hand.&#8221;</span> And the man stretched it out, and it was restored, healthy like the other.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But the Pharisees went out and conspired against him, how to destroy him.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah:</p>
