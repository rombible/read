<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Jesus Delivered to Pilate</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>When morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And they bound him and led him away and delivered him over to Pilate the governor.</p>
<p class="heading">Judas Hangs Himself</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then when Judas, his betrayer, saw that Jesus<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek he">a</a></sup></span> was condemned, he changed his mind and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>saying, &#8220;I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.&#8221; They said, &#8220;What is that to us? See to it yourself.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And throwing down the pieces of silver into the temple, he departed, and he went and hanged himself.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said, &#8220;It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is blood money.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So they took counsel and bought with them the potter&#8217;s field as a burial place for strangers.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then was fulfilled what had been spoken by the prophet Jeremiah, saying, &#8220;And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him on whom a price had been set by some of the sons of Israel,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and they gave them for the potter&#8217;s field, as the Lord directed me.&#8221;</p>
<p class="heading">Jesus Before Pilate</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, &#8220;Are you the King of the Jews?&#8221; Jesus said, <span class="woc">&#8220;You have said so.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he gave no answer.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then Pilate said to him, &#8220;Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But he gave him no answer, not even to a single charge, so that the governor was greatly amazed.</p>
<p class="heading">The Crowd Chooses Barabbas</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release for the crowd any one prisoner whom they wanted.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And they had then a notorious prisoner called Barabbas.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So when they had gathered, Pilate said to them, &#8220;Whom do you want me to release for you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>For he knew that it was out of envy that they had delivered him up.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Besides, while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him, &#8220;Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered much because of him today in a dream.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>The governor again said to them, &#8220;Which of the two do you want me to release for you?&#8221; And they said, &#8220;Barabbas.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Pilate said to them, &#8220;Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?&#8221; They all said, &#8220;Let him be crucified!&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;Why? What evil has he done?&#8221; But they shouted all the more, &#8220;Let him be crucified!&#8221;</p>
<p class="heading">Pilate Delivers Jesus to Be Crucified</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>So when Pilate saw that he was gaining nothing, but rather that a riot was beginning, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, &#8220;I am innocent of this man&#8217;s blood;<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts this righteous blood, or this righteous man's blood">b</a></sup></span> see to it yourselves.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And all the people answered, &#8220;His blood be on us and on our children!&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Then he released for them Barabbas, and having scourged<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="A Roman judicial penalty, consisting of a severe beating with a multi-lashed whip containing embedded pieces of bone and metal">c</a></sup></span> Jesus, delivered him to be crucified.</p>
<p class="heading">Jesus Is Mocked</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the governor&#8217;s headquarters,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek the praetorium">d</a></sup></span> and they gathered the whole battalion<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek cohort; a tenth of a Roman legion, usually about 600 men">e</a></sup></span> before him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And they stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>and twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on his head and put a reed in his right hand. And kneeling before him, they mocked him, saying, &#8220;Hail, King of the Jews!&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And they spit on him and took the reed and struck him on the head.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the robe and put his own clothes on him and led him away to crucify him.</p>
<p class="heading">The Crucifixion</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>As they went out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name. They compelled this man to carry his cross.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And when they came to a place called Golgotha (which means Place of a Skull),
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>they offered him wine to drink, mixed with gall, but when he tasted it, he would not drink it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments among them by casting lots.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Then they sat down and kept watch over him there.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>And over his head they put the charge against him, which read, &#8220;This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>Then two robbers were crucified with him, one on the right and one on the left.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>and saying, &#8220;You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>So also the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, mocked him, saying,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>&#8220;He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if he desires him. For he said, &#8216;I am the Son of God.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>And the robbers who were crucified with him also reviled him in the same way.</p>
<p class="heading">The Death of Jesus</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>Now from the sixth hour<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, noon">f</a></sup></span> there was darkness over all the land<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or earth">g</a></sup></span> until the ninth hour.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, 3 p.m.">h</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span>And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, <span class="woc">&#8220;Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?&#8221;</span> that is, <span class="woc">&#8220;My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-47.htm"><b>47</b></a></span>And some of the bystanders, hearing it, said, &#8220;This man is calling Elijah.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-48.htm"><b>48</b></a></span>And one of them at once ran and took a sponge, filled it with sour wine, and put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-49.htm"><b>49</b></a></span>But the others said, &#8220;Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to save him.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-50.htm"><b>50</b></a></span>And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-51.htm"><b>51</b></a></span>And behold, the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. And the earth shook, and the rocks were split.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-52.htm"><b>52</b></a></span>The tombs also were opened. And many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-53.htm"><b>53</b></a></span>and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-54.htm"><b>54</b></a></span>When the centurion and those who were with him, keeping watch over Jesus, saw the earthquake and what took place, they were filled with awe and said, &#8220;Truly this was the Son<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or a son">i</a></sup></span> of God!&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-55.htm"><b>55</b></a></span>There were also many women there, looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-56.htm"><b>56</b></a></span>among whom were Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Joseph and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-58.htm"><b>58</b></a></span>He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-59.htm"><b>59</b></a></span>And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen shroud
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-60.htm"><b>60</b></a></span>and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut in the rock. And he rolled a great stone to the entrance of the tomb and went away.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-61.htm"><b>61</b></a></span>Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb.</p>
