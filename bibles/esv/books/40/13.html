<div class="chap"><p class="heading">The Parable of the Sower</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat beside the sea.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And great crowds gathered about him, so that he got into a boat and sat down. And the whole crowd stood on the beach.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And he told them many things in parables, saying: <span class="woc">&#8220;A sower went out to sow.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span><span class="woc">And as he sowed, some seeds fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured them.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span><span class="woc">Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil, and immediately they sprang up, since they had no depth of soil,</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span><span class="woc">but when the sun rose they were scorched. And since they had no root, they withered away.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span><span class="woc">Other seeds fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><span class="woc">Other seeds fell on good soil and produced grain, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span><span class="woc">He who has ears,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts add here and in verse 43 to hear">a</a></sup></span> let him hear.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="heading">The Purpose of the Parables</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then the disciples came and said to him, &#8220;Why do you speak to them in parables?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And he answered them, <span class="woc">&#8220;To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span><span class="woc">For to the one who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span><span class="woc">This is why I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span><span class="woc">Indeed, in their case the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled that says:</span></p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group"><span class="woc">&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;You will indeed hear but never understand,</span><br /><span class="indent">and you will indeed see but never perceive.&#8221;</span></span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span><span class="ln-group"><span class="woc">For this people&#8217;s heart has grown dull,</span><br /><span class="indent">and with their ears they can barely hear,</span><br /><span class="indent">and their eyes they have closed,</span><br /><span class="ln-group">lest they should see with their eyes</span><br /><span class="indent">and hear with their ears</span><br /><span class="ln-group">and understand with their heart</span><br /><span class="indent">and turn, and I would heal them.&#8217;</span></span></p>
<p class="same-paragraph"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span><span class="woc">But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span><span class="woc">For truly, I say to you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.</span></p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span><span class="woc">When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown along the path.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span><span class="woc">As for what was sown on rocky ground, this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy,</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span><span class="woc">yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while, and when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately he falls away.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or stumbles">b</a></sup></span></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span><span class="woc">As for what was sown among thorns, this is the one who hears the word, but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it proves unfruitful.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span><span class="woc">As for what was sown on good soil, this is the one who hears the word and understands it.

<p class="heading">The Parable of the Weeds</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>He put another parable before them, saying, <span class="woc">&#8220;The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field,</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span><span class="woc">but while his men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Probably darnel, a wheat-like weed">c</a></sup></span> among the wheat and went away.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span><span class="woc">So when the plants came up and bore grain, then the weeds appeared also.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span><span class="woc">And the servants<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or bondservants; also verse 28">d</a></sup></span> of the master of the house came and said to him, &#8216;Master, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have weeds?&#8217;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span><span class="woc">He said to them, &#8216;An enemy has done this.&#8217; So the servants said to him, &#8216;Then do you want us to go and gather them?&#8217;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span><span class="woc">But he said, &#8216;No, lest in gathering the weeds you root up the wheat along with them.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span><span class="woc">Let both grow together until the harvest, and at harvest time I will tell the reapers, &#8220;Gather the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn.&#8221;&#8217;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="heading">The Mustard Seed and the Leaven</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>He put another parable before them, saying, <span class="woc">&#8220;The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span><span class="woc">It is the smallest of all seeds, but when it has grown it is larger than all the garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>He told them another parable. <span class="woc">&#8220;The kingdom of heaven is like leaven that a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, till it was all leavened.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="heading">Prophecy and Parables</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>All these things Jesus said to the crowds in parables; indeed, he said nothing to them without a parable.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet:<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts Isaiah the prophet">e</a></sup></span></p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">&#8220;I will open my mouth in parables;</span><br /><span class="indent">I will utter what has been hidden since the foundation of the world.&#8221;</span></p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>He answered, <span class="woc">&#8220;The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span><span class="woc">The field is the world, and the good seed is the sons of the kingdom. The weeds are the sons of the evil one,</span>
