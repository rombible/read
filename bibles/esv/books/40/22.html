<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span><span class="woc">&#8220;The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a wedding feast for his son,</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span><span class="woc">and sent his servants<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or bondservants; also verses 4, 6, 8, 10">a</a></sup></span> to call those who were invited to the wedding feast, but they would not come.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span><span class="woc">Again he sent other servants, saying, &#8216;Tell those who are invited, &#8220;See, I have prepared my dinner, my oxen and my fat calves have been slaughtered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast.&#8221;&#8217;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span><span class="woc">But they paid no attention and went off, one to his farm, another to his business,</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span><span class="woc">while the rest seized his servants, treated them shamefully, and killed them.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span><span class="woc">The king was angry, and he sent his troops and destroyed those murderers and burned their city.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><span class="woc">Then he said to his servants, &#8216;The wedding feast is ready, but those invited were not worthy.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span><span class="woc">Go therefore to the main roads and invite to the wedding feast as many as you find.&#8217;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><span class="woc">And those servants went out into the roads and gathered all whom they found, both bad and good. So the wedding hall was filled with guests.</span></p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span><span class="woc">&#8220;But when the king came in to look at the guests, he saw there a man who had no wedding garment.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span><span class="woc">And he said to him, &#8216;Friend, how did you get in here without a wedding garment?&#8217; And he was speechless.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span><span class="woc">Then the king said to the attendants, &#8216;Bind him hand and foot and cast him into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.&#8217;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span><span class="woc">For many are called, but few are chosen.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="heading">Paying Taxes to Caesar</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then the Pharisees went and plotted how to entangle him in his words.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And they sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, &#8220;Teacher, we know that you are true and teach the way of God truthfully, and you do not care about anyone&#8217;s opinion, for you are not swayed by appearances.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek for you do not look at people's faces">b</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Tell us, then, what you think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, <span class="woc">&#8220;Why put me to the test, you hypocrites?</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span><span class="woc">Show me the coin for the tax.&#8221;</span> And they brought him a denarius.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="A denarius was a day's wage for a laborer">c</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And Jesus said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Whose likeness and inscription is this?&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>They said, &#8220;Caesar&#8217;s.&#8221; Then he said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Therefore render to Caesar the things that are Caesar&#8217;s, and to God the things that are God&#8217;s.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>When they heard it, they marveled. And they left him and went away.</p>
<p class="heading">Sadducees Ask About the Resurrection</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>The same day Sadducees came to him, who say that there is no resurrection, and they asked him a question,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>saying, &#8220;Teacher, Moses said, &#8216;If a man dies having no children, his brother must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Now there were seven brothers among us. The first married and died, and having no offspring left his wife to his brother.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>So too the second and third, down to the seventh.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>After them all, the woman died.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>In the resurrection, therefore, of the seven, whose wife will she be? For they all had her.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>But Jesus answered them, <span class="woc">&#8220;You are wrong, because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span><span class="woc">For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span><span class="woc">And as for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was said to you by God:</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span><span class="woc">&#8216;I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob&#8217;? He is not God of the dead, but of the living.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And when the crowd heard it, they were astonished at his teaching.</p>
<p class="heading">The Great Commandment</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>And one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question to test him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>&#8220;Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>And he said to him, <span class="woc">&#8220;You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span><span class="woc">This is the great and first commandment.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span><span class="woc">And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.</span>
