<div class="chap"><p class="heading">The Death of John the Baptist</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>At that time Herod the tetrarch heard about the fame of Jesus,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and he said to his servants, &#8220;This is John the Baptist. He has been raised from the dead; that is why these miraculous powers are at work in him.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For Herod had seized John and bound him and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip&#8217;s wife,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts his brother's wife">a</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>because John had been saying to him, &#8220;It is not lawful for you to have her.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And though he wanted to put him to death, he feared the people, because they held him to be a prophet.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But when Herod&#8217;s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before the company and pleased Herod,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>so that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Prompted by her mother, she said, &#8220;Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And the king was sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests he commanded it to be given.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>He sent and had John beheaded in the prison,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>and his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And his disciples came and took the body and buried it, and they went and told Jesus.</p>
<p class="heading">Jesus Feeds the Five Thousand</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat to a desolate place by himself. But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>When he went ashore he saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them and healed their sick.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Now when it was evening, the disciples came to him and said, &#8220;This is a desolate place, and the day is now over; send the crowds away to go into the villages and buy food for themselves.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But Jesus said, <span class="woc">&#8220;They need not go away; you give them something to eat.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>They said to him, &#8220;We have only five loaves here and two fish.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And he said, <span class="woc">&#8220;Bring them here to me.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass, and taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and said a blessing. Then he broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up twelve baskets full of the broken pieces left over.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.</p>
<p class="heading">Jesus Walks on the Water</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowds.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And after he had dismissed the crowds, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>but the boat by this time was a long way<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek many stadia, a stadion was about 607 feet or 185 meters">b</a></sup></span> from the land,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts was out on the sea">c</a></sup></span> beaten by the waves, for the wind was against them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And in the fourth watch of the night<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, between 3 a.m. and 6 a.m.">d</a></sup></span> he came to them, walking on the sea.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>But when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified, and said, &#8220;It is a ghost!&#8221; and they cried out in fear.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, <span class="woc">&#8220;Take heart; it is I. Do not be afraid.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And Peter answered him, &#8220;Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>He said, <span class="woc">&#8220;Come.&#8221;</span> So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water and came to Jesus.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>But when he saw the wind,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts strong wind">e</a></sup></span> he was afraid, and beginning to sink he cried out, &#8220;Lord, save me.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Jesus immediately reached out his hand and took hold of him, saying to him, <span class="woc">&#8220;O you of little faith, why did you doubt?&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And those in the boat worshiped him, saying, &#8220;Truly you are the Son of God.&#8221;</p>
<p class="heading">Jesus Heals the Sick in Gennesaret</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>And when they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret.
