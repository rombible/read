<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/16-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>He answered them,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts omit the following words to the end of verse 3">a</a></sup></span> <span class="woc">&#8220;When it is evening, you say, &#8216;It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.&#8217;</span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/16-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Jesus said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Watch and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/16-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And they began discussing it among themselves, saying, &#8220;We brought no bread.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/16-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But Jesus, aware of this, said, <span class="woc">&#8220;O you of little faith, why are you discussing among yourselves the fact that you have no bread?</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/16-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span><span class="woc">Do you not yet perceive? Do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you gathered?</span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/16-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And they said, &#8220;Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.&#8221;
