<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And behold, a leper<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Leprosy was a term for several skin diseases; see Leviticus 13">a</a></sup></span> came to him and knelt before him, saying, &#8220;Lord, if you will, you can make me clean.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And Jesus<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek he">b</a></sup></span> stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, <span class="woc">&#8220;I will; be clean.&#8221;</span> And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And Jesus said to him, <span class="woc">&#8220;See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a proof to them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="heading">The Faith of a Centurion</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>When he had entered Capernaum, a centurion came forward to him, appealing to him,

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And he said to him, <span class="woc">&#8220;I will come and heal him.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But the centurion replied, &#8220;Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof, but only say the word, and my servant will be healed.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For I too am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. And I say to one, &#8216;Go,&#8217; and he goes, and to another, &#8216;Come,&#8217; and he comes, and to my servant,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or bondservant">c</a></sup></span> &#8216;Do this,&#8217; and he does it.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>When Jesus heard this, he marveled and said to those who followed him, <span class="woc">&#8220;Truly, I tell you, with no one in Israel<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts not even in Israel">d</a></sup></span> have I found such faith.</span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And to the centurion Jesus said, <span class="woc">&#8220;Go; let it be done for you as you have believed.&#8221;</span> And the servant was healed at that very moment.</p>
<p class="heading">Jesus Heals Many</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And when Jesus entered Peter&#8217;s house, he saw his mother-in-law lying sick with a fever.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>He touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she rose and began to serve him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>That evening they brought to him many who were oppressed by demons, and he cast out the spirits with a word and healed all who were sick.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah: &#8220;He took our illnesses and bore our diseases.&#8221;</p>
<p class="heading">The Cost of Following Jesus</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Now when Jesus saw a crowd around him, he gave orders to go over to the other side.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And a scribe came up and said to him, &#8220;Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And Jesus said to him, <span class="woc">&#8220;Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Another of the disciples said to him, &#8220;Lord, let me first go and bury my father.&#8221;

<p class="heading">Jesus Calms a Storm</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And when he got into the boat, his disciples followed him.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And they went and woke him, saying, &#8220;Save us, Lord; we are perishing.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And he said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Why are you afraid, O you of little faith?&#8221;</span> Then he rose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And the men marveled, saying, &#8220;What sort of man is this, that even winds and sea obey him?&#8221;</p>
