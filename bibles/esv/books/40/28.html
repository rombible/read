<div class="chap"><p class="heading">The Resurrection</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Now after the Sabbath, toward the dawn of the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone and sat on it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And for fear of him the guards trembled and became like dead men.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But the angel said to the women, &#8220;Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>He is not here, for he has risen, as he said. Come, see the place where he<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts the Lord">a</a></sup></span> lay.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead, and behold, he is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him. See, I have told you.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And behold, Jesus met them and said, <span class="woc">&#8220;Greetings!&#8221;</span> And they came up and took hold of his feet and worshiped him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then Jesus said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="heading">The Report of the Guard</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>While they were going, behold, some of the guard went into the city and told the chief priests all that had taken place.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And when they had assembled with the elders and taken counsel, they gave a sufficient sum of money to the soldiers
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>and said, &#8220;Tell people, &#8216;His disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And if this comes to the governor&#8217;s ears, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So they took the money and did as they were directed. And this story has been spread among the Jews to this day.</p>
<p class="heading">The Great Commission</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And when they saw him they worshiped him, but some doubted.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And Jesus came and said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.</span>
