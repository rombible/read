<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Jesus said to him, <span class="woc">&#8220;Do you see these great buildings? There will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="heading">Signs of the End of the Age</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And as he sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8220;Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign when all these things are about to be accomplished?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And Jesus began to say to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;See that no one leads you astray.</span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/13-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span><span class="woc">And when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed. This must take place, but the end is not yet.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><span class="woc">For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places; there will be famines. These are but the beginning of the birth pains.</span></p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/13-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span><span class="woc">&#8220;But be on your guard. For they will deliver you over to councils, and you will be beaten in synagogues, and you will stand before governors and kings for my sake, to bear witness before them.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/13-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><span class="woc">And the gospel must first be proclaimed to all nations.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span><span class="woc">And when they bring you to trial and deliver you over, do not be anxious beforehand what you are to say, but say whatever is given you in that hour, for it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/13-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span><span class="woc">And brother will deliver brother over to death, and the father his child, and children will rise against parents and have them put to death.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/13-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span><span class="woc">And you will be hated by all for my name&#8217;s sake. But the one who endures to the end will be saved.</span></p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/13-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span><span class="woc">And then if anyone says to you, &#8216;Look, here is the Christ!&#8217; or &#8216;Look, there he is!&#8217; do not believe it.</span>
