<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Jesus Rejected at Nazareth</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>He went away from there and came to his hometown, and his disciples followed him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And on the Sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were astonished, saying, &#8220;Where did this man get these things? What is the wisdom given to him? How are such mighty works done by his hands?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us?&#8221; And they took offense at him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And Jesus said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;A prophet is not without honor, except in his hometown and among his relatives and in his own household.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And he could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and healed them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And he marveled because of their unbelief.</p><p class="regular">And he went about among the villages teaching.</p>
<p class="heading">Jesus Sends Out the Twelve Apostles</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And he called the twelve and began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over the unclean spirits.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>He charged them to take nothing for their journey except a staff&#8212;no bread, no bag, no money in their belts&#8212;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>but to wear sandals and not put on two tunics.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek chiton, a long garment worn under the cloak next to the skin">a</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And he said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you depart from there.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span><span class="woc">And if any place will not receive you and they will not listen to you, when you leave, shake off the dust that is on your feet as a testimony against them.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So they went out and proclaimed that people should repent.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And they cast out many demons and anointed with oil many who were sick and healed them.</p>
<p class="heading">The Death of John the Baptist</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>King Herod heard of it, for Jesus&#8217;<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek his">b</a></sup></span> name had become known. Some<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts He">c</a></sup></span> said, &#8220;John the Baptist<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek baptizer; also verse 24">d</a></sup></span> has been raised from the dead. That is why these miraculous powers are at work in him.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But others said, &#8220;He is Elijah.&#8221; And others said, &#8220;He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But when Herod heard of it, he said, &#8220;John, whom I beheaded, has been raised.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>For it was Herod who had sent and seized John and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip&#8217;s wife, because he had married her.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>For John had been saying to Herod, &#8220;It is not lawful for you to have your brother&#8217;s wife.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And Herodias had a grudge against him and wanted to put him to death. But she could not,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he kept him safe. When he heard him, he was greatly perplexed, and yet he heard him gladly.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>But an opportunity came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his nobles and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>For when Herodias&#8217;s daughter came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests. And the king said to the girl, &#8220;Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will give it to you.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And he vowed to her, &#8220;Whatever you ask me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And she went out and said to her mother, &#8220;For what should I ask?&#8221; And she said, &#8220;The head of John the Baptist.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And she came in immediately with haste to the king and asked, saying, &#8220;I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And the king was exceedingly sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests he did not want to break his word to her.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And immediately the king sent an executioner with orders to bring John&#8217;s<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek his">e</a></sup></span> head. He went and beheaded him in the prison
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>and brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>When his disciples heard of it, they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.</p>
<p class="heading">Jesus Feeds the Five Thousand</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>The apostles returned to Jesus and told him all that they had done and taught.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>And he said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Come away by yourselves to a desolate place and rest a while.&#8221;</span> For many were coming and going, and they had no leisure even to eat.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And they went away in the boat to a desolate place by themselves.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Now many saw them going and recognized them, and they ran there on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>When he went ashore he saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. And he began to teach them many things.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>And when it grew late, his disciples came to him and said, &#8220;This is a desolate place, and the hour is now late.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Send them away to go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>But he answered them, <span class="woc">&#8220;You give them something to eat.&#8221;</span> And they said to him, &#8220;Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="A denarius was a day's wage for a laborer">f</a></sup></span> worth of bread and give it to them to eat?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>And he said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;How many loaves do you have? Go and see.&#8221;</span> And when they had found out, they said, &#8220;Five, and two fish.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>Then he commanded them all to sit down in groups on the green grass.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>So they sat down in groups, by hundreds and by fifties.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>And taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and said a blessing and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to set before the people. And he divided the two fish among them all.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>And they all ate and were satisfied.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>And they took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and of the fish.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>And those who ate the loaves were five thousand men.</p>
<p class="heading">Jesus Walks on the Water</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>Immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span>And after he had taken leave of them, he went up on the mountain to pray.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-47.htm"><b>47</b></a></span>And when evening came, the boat was out on the sea, and he was alone on the land.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-48.htm"><b>48</b></a></span>And he saw that they were making headway painfully, for the wind was against them. And about the fourth watch of the night<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, between 3 a.m. and 6 a.m.">g</a></sup></span> he came to them, walking on the sea. He meant to pass by them,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-49.htm"><b>49</b></a></span>but when they saw him walking on the sea they thought it was a ghost, and cried out,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-50.htm"><b>50</b></a></span>for they all saw him and were terrified. But immediately he spoke to them and said, <span class="woc">&#8220;Take heart; it is I. Do not be afraid.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-51.htm"><b>51</b></a></span>And he got into the boat with them, and the wind ceased. And they were utterly astounded,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-52.htm"><b>52</b></a></span>for they did not understand about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened.</p>
<p class="heading">Jesus Heals the Sick in Gennesaret</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-53.htm"><b>53</b></a></span>When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret and moored to the shore.
