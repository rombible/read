<p class="heading">The Transfiguration</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And after six days Jesus took with him Peter and James and John, and led them up a high mountain by themselves. And he was transfigured before them,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and his clothes became radiant, intensely white, as no one<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek launderer (gnapheus)">a</a></sup></span> on earth could bleach them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And there appeared to them Elijah with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And Peter said to Jesus, &#8220;Rabbi,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Rabbi means my teacher, or my master">b</a></sup></span> it is good that we are here. Let us make three tents, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>For he did not know what to say, for they were terrified.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And a cloud overshadowed them, and a voice came out of the cloud, &#8220;This is my beloved Son;<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or my Son, my (or the) Beloved">c</a></sup></span> listen to him.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And suddenly, looking around, they no longer saw anyone with them but Jesus only.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And as they were coming down the mountain, he charged them to tell no one what they had seen, until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So they kept the matter to themselves, questioning what this rising from the dead might mean.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And they asked him, &#8220;Why do the scribes say that first Elijah must come?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And he said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Elijah does come first to restore all things. And how is it written of the Son of Man that he should suffer many things and be treated with contempt?</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span><span class="woc">But I tell you that Elijah has come, and they did to him whatever they pleased, as it is written of him.&#8221;</span></p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And immediately all the crowd, when they saw him, were greatly amazed and ran up to him and greeted him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And he asked them, <span class="woc">&#8220;What are you arguing about with them?&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And someone from the crowd answered him, &#8220;Teacher, I brought my son to you, for he has a spirit that makes him mute.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And whenever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid. So I asked your disciples to cast it out, and they were not able.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And he answered them, <span class="woc">&#8220;O faithless generation, how long am I to be with you? How long am I to bear with you? Bring him to me.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And they brought the boy to him. And when the spirit saw him, immediately it convulsed the boy, and he fell on the ground and rolled about, foaming at the mouth.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And Jesus asked his father, <span class="woc">&#8220;How long has this been happening to him?&#8221;</span> And he said, &#8220;From childhood.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And it has often cast him into fire and into water, to destroy him. But if you can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And Jesus said to him, <span class="woc">&#8220;&#8216;If you can&#8217;! All things are possible for one who believes.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Immediately the father of the child cried out<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts add with tears">d</a></sup></span> and said, &#8220;I believe; help my unbelief!&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And when Jesus saw that a crowd came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, <span class="woc">&#8220;You mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him and never enter him again.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And after crying out and convulsing him terribly, it came out, and the boy was like a corpse, so that most of them said, &#8220;He is dead.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he arose.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And when he had entered the house, his disciples asked him privately, &#8220;Why could we not cast it out?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And he said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;This kind cannot be driven out by anything but prayer.&#8221;<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts add and fasting">e</a></sup></span></span></p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>But they did not understand the saying, and were afraid to ask him.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>But they kept silent, for on the way they had argued with one another about who was the greatest.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>And he sat down and called the twelve. And he said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;If anyone would be first, he must be last of all and servant of all.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>And he took a child and put him in the midst of them, and taking him in his arms, he said to them,
