<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span><span class="woc">&#8220;I have compassion on the crowd, because they have been with me now three days and have nothing to eat.</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span><span class="woc">And if I send them away hungry to their homes, they will faint on the way. And some of them have come from far away.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And his disciples answered him, &#8220;How can one feed these people with bread here in this desolate place?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And he asked them, <span class="woc">&#8220;How many loaves do you have?&#8221;</span> They said, &#8220;Seven.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And he directed the crowd to sit down on the ground. And he took the seven loaves, and having given thanks, he broke them and gave them to his disciples to set before the people; and they set them before the crowd.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And they had a few small fish. And having blessed them, he said that these also should be set before them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And they ate and were satisfied. And they took up the broken pieces left over, seven baskets full.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And there were about four thousand people. And he sent them away.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And immediately he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the district of Dalmanutha.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts Magadan, or Magdala">a</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="heading">The Pharisees Demand a Sign</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>The Pharisees came and began to argue with him, seeking from him a sign from heaven to test him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And he sighed deeply in his spirit and said, <span class="woc">&#8220;Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly, I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And he left them, got into the boat again, and went to the other side.</p>
<p class="heading">The Leaven of the Pharisees and Herod</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Now they had forgotten to bring bread, and they had only one loaf with them in the boat.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And he cautioned them, saying, <span class="woc">&#8220;Watch out; beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.&#8221;<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts the Herodians">b</a></sup></span></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And they began discussing with one another the fact that they had no bread.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And Jesus, aware of this, said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Why are you discussing the fact that you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Are your hearts hardened?</span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village, and when he had spit on his eyes and laid his hands on him, he asked him, <span class="woc">&#8220;Do you see anything?&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And he looked up and said, &#8220;I see people, but they look like trees, walking.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then Jesus<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek he">c</a></sup></span> laid his hands on his eyes again; and he opened his eyes, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly.

<p class="heading">Peter Confesses Jesus as the Christ</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And Jesus went on with his disciples to the villages of Caesarea Philippi.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And they told him, &#8220;John the Baptist; and others say, Elijah; and others, one of the prophets.&#8221;
