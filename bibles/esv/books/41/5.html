<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And when Jesus<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek he; also verse 9">b</a></sup></span> had stepped out of the boat, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>He lived among the tombs. And no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>for he had often been bound with shackles and chains, but he wrenched the chains apart, and he broke the shackles in pieces. No one had the strength to subdue him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was always crying out and cutting himself with stones.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And when he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and fell down before him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And crying out with a loud voice, he said, &#8220;What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I adjure you by God, do not torment me.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For he was saying to him, <span class="woc">&#8220;Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And Jesus asked him, <span class="woc">&#8220;What is your name?&#8221;</span> He replied, &#8220;My name is Legion, for we are many.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And he begged him earnestly not to send them out of the country.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now a great herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>and they begged him, saying, &#8220;Send us to the pigs; let us enter them.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So he gave them permission. And the unclean spirits came out and entered the pigs; and the herd, numbering about two thousand, rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned in the sea.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>The herdsmen fled and told it in the city and in the country. And people came to see what it was that had happened.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And they came to Jesus and saw the demon-possessed<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek daimonizomai (demonized); also verses 16, 18; elsewhere rendered oppressed by demons">c</a></sup></span> man, the one who had had the legion, sitting there, clothed and in his right mind, and they were afraid.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And those who had seen it described to them what had happened to the demon-possessed man and to the pigs.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And they began to beg Jesus<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek him">d</a></sup></span> to depart from their region.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>As he was getting into the boat, the man who had been possessed with demons begged him that he might be with him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And he did not permit him but said to him, <span class="woc">&#8220;Go home to your friends and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him, and everyone marveled.</p>
<p class="heading">Jesus Heals a Woman and Jairus&#8217;s Daughter</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And when Jesus had crossed again in the boat to the other side, a great crowd gathered about him, and he was beside the sea.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then came one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name, and seeing him, he fell at his feet
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>and implored him earnestly, saying, &#8220;My little daughter is at the point of death. Come and lay your hands on her, so that she may be made well and live.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And he went with him.</p><p class="regular">And a great crowd followed him and thronged about him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And there was a woman who had had a discharge of blood for twelve years,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>and who had suffered much under many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better but rather grew worse.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>She had heard the reports about Jesus and came up behind him in the crowd and touched his garment.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>For she said, &#8220;If I touch even his garments, I will be made well.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And immediately the flow of blood dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And Jesus, perceiving in himself that power had gone out from him, immediately turned about in the crowd and said, <span class="woc">&#8220;Who touched my garments?&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>And his disciples said to him, &#8220;You see the crowd pressing around you, and yet you say, <span class="woc">&#8216;Who touched me?&#8217;</span>&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And he looked around to see who had done it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>But the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came in fear and trembling and fell down before him and told him the whole truth.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>And he said to her, <span class="woc">&#8220;Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace, and be healed of your disease.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>While he was still speaking, there came from the ruler&#8217;s house some who said, &#8220;Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>But overhearing<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or ignoring; some manuscripts hearing">e</a></sup></span> what they said, Jesus said to the ruler of the synagogue, <span class="woc">&#8220;Do not fear, only believe.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>And he allowed no one to follow him except Peter and James and John the brother of James.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>They came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and Jesus<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek he">f</a></sup></span> saw a commotion, people weeping and wailing loudly.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>And when he had entered, he said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Why are you making a commotion and weeping? The child is not dead but sleeping.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>And they laughed at him. But he put them all outside and took the child&#8217;s father and mother and those who were with him and went in where the child was.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>Taking her by the hand he said to her, <span class="woc">&#8220;Talitha cumi,&#8221;</span> which means, <span class="woc">&#8220;Little girl, I say to you, arise.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>And immediately the girl got up and began walking (for she was twelve years of age), and they were immediately overcome with amazement.
