<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Jesus Delivered to Pilate</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>And as soon as it was morning, the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council. And they bound Jesus and led him away and delivered him over to Pilate.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Pilate asked him, &#8220;Are you the King of the Jews?&#8221; And he answered him, <span class="woc">&#8220;You have said so.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And the chief priests accused him of many things.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And Pilate again asked him, &#8220;Have you no answer to make? See how many charges they bring against you.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate was amazed.</p>
<p class="heading">Pilate Delivers Jesus to Be Crucified</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now at the feast he used to release for them one prisoner for whom they asked.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And among the rebels in prison, who had committed murder in the insurrection, there was a man called Barabbas.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do as he usually did for them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And he answered them, saying, &#8220;Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For he perceived that it was out of envy that the chief priests had delivered him up.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release for them Barabbas instead.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And Pilate again said to them, &#8220;Then what shall I do with the man you call the King of the Jews?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And they cried out again, &#8220;Crucify him.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And Pilate said to them, &#8220;Why? What evil has he done?&#8221; But they shouted all the more, &#8220;Crucify him.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released for them Barabbas, and having scourged<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="A Roman judicial penalty, consisting of a severe beating with a multi-lashed whip containing embedded pieces of bone and metal">a</a></sup></span> Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.</p>
<p class="heading">Jesus Is Mocked</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And the soldiers led him away inside the palace (that is, the governor&#8217;s headquarters),<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek the praetorium">b</a></sup></span> and they called together the whole battalion.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek cohort; a tenth of a Roman legion, usually about 600 men">c</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And they clothed him in a purple cloak, and twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And they began to salute him, &#8220;Hail, King of the Jews!&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And they were striking his head with a reed and spitting on him and kneeling down in homage to him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the purple cloak and put his own clothes on him. And they led him out to crucify him.</p>
<p class="heading">The Crucifixion</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And they compelled a passerby, Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to carry his cross.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And they brought him to the place called Golgotha (which means Place of a Skull).
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And they offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And they crucified him and divided his garments among them, casting lots for them, to decide what each should take.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And it was the third hour<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, 9 a.m.">d</a></sup></span> when they crucified him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And the inscription of the charge against him read, &#8220;The King of the Jews.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And with him they crucified two robbers, one on his right and one on his left.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts insert verse 28: And the Scripture was fulfilled that says, He was numbered with the transgressors">e</a></sup></span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads and saying, &#8220;Aha! You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>save yourself, and come down from the cross!&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>So also the chief priests with the scribes mocked him to one another, saying, &#8220;He saved others; he cannot save himself.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross that we may see and believe.&#8221; Those who were crucified with him also reviled him.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, <span class="woc">&#8220;Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?&#8221;</span> which means, <span class="woc">&#8220;My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?&#8221;</span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>And someone ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink, saying, &#8220;Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>And Jesus uttered a loud cry and breathed his last.
