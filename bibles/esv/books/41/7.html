<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/7-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And the Pharisees and the scribes asked him, &#8220;Why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat with defiled hands?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/7-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And he said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written,</span></p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group"><span class="woc">&#8220;&#8216;This people honors me with their lips,</span><br /><span class="indent">but their heart is far from me;</span></span><br />

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><span class="woc">For Moses said, &#8216;Honor your father and your mother&#8217;; and, &#8216;Whoever reviles father or mother must surely die.&#8217;</span>

<p class="heading">What Defiles a Person</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/7-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And he called the people to him again and said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Hear me, all of you, and understand:</span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/7-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>But immediately a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit heard of him and came and fell down at his feet.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/7-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>But she answered him, &#8220;Yes, Lord; yet even the dogs under the table eat the children&#8217;s crumbs.&#8221;
