<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And many were gathered together, so that there was no more room, not even at the door. And he was preaching the word to them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And they came, bringing to him a paralytic carried by four men.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And when they could not get near him because of the crowd, they removed the roof above him, and when they had made an opening, they let down the bed on which the paralytic lay.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, <span class="woc">&#8220;Son, your sins are forgiven.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now some of the scribes were sitting there, questioning in their hearts,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8220;Why does this man speak like that? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they thus questioned within themselves, said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Why do you question these things in your hearts?</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span><span class="woc">Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, &#8216;Your sins are forgiven,&#8217; or to say, &#8216;Rise, take up your bed and walk&#8217;?</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><span class="woc">But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins&#8221;</span>&#8212;he said to the paralytic&#8212;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span><span class="woc">&#8220;I say to you, rise, pick up your bed, and go home.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And he rose and immediately picked up his bed and went out before them all, so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, &#8220;We never saw anything like this!&#8221;</p>
<p class="heading">Jesus Calls Levi</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>He went out again beside the sea, and all the crowd was coming to him, and he was teaching them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him, <span class="woc">&#8220;Follow me.&#8221;</span> And he rose and followed him.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And as he reclined at table in his house, many tax collectors and sinners were reclining with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many who followed him.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And when Jesus heard it, he said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="heading">A Question About Fasting</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Now John&#8217;s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And Jesus said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.</span>
