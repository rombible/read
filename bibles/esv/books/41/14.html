And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to arrest him by stealth and kill him,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/14-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>for they said, &#8220;Not during the feast, lest there be an uproar from the people.&#8221;</p>
<p class="heading">Jesus Anointed at Bethany</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/14-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And while he was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Leprosy was a term for several skin diseases; see Leviticus 13">a</a></sup></span> as he was reclining at table, a woman came with an alabaster flask of ointment of pure nard, very costly, and she broke the flask and poured it over his head.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/14-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>There were some who said to themselves indignantly, &#8220;Why was the ointment wasted like that?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/14-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For this ointment could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="A denarius was a day's wage for a laborer">b</a></sup></span> and given to the poor.&#8221; And they scolded her.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/14-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But Jesus said, <span class="woc">&#8220;Leave her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a beautiful thing to me.</span>

<p class="heading">Judas to Betray Jesus</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/14-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went to the chief priests in order to betray him to them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/14-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And when they heard it, they were glad and promised to give him money. And he sought an opportunity to betray him.</p>
<p class="heading">The Passover with the Disciples</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/14-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And on the first day of Unleavened Bread, when they sacrificed the Passover lamb, his disciples said to him, &#8220;Where will you have us go and prepare for you to eat the Passover?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/14-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And he sent two of his disciples and said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him,</span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/14-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And the disciples set out and went to the city and found it just as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/14-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>They began to be sorrowful and to say to him one after another, &#8220;Is it I?&#8221;

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/14-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank of it.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/14-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>And going a little farther, he fell on the ground and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.
