<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to see if he could find anything on it. When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/11-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And he said to it, <span class="woc">&#8220;May no one ever eat fruit from you again.&#8221;</span> And his disciples heard it.</p>
