<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/12-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>There were seven brothers; the first took a wife, and when he died left no offspring.

<p class="heading">The Great Commandment</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/12-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that he answered them well, asked him, &#8220;Which commandment is the most important of all?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/12-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Jesus answered, <span class="woc">&#8220;The most important is, &#8216;Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one.</span>
