<div class="chap"><p class="heading">The Philistines and the Ark</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>When the Philistines captured the ark of God, they brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then the Philistines took the ark of God and brought it into the house of Dagon and set it up beside Dagon.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And when the people of Ashdod rose early the next day, behold, Dagon had fallen face downward on the ground before the ark of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. So they took Dagon and put him back in his place.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But when they rose early on the next morning, behold, Dagon had fallen face downward on the ground before the ark of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and the head of Dagon and both his hands were lying cut off on the threshold. Only the trunk of Dagon was left to him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>This is why the priests of Dagon and all who enter the house of Dagon do not tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>The hand of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> was heavy against the people of Ashdod, and he terrified and afflicted them with tumors, both Ashdod and its territory.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And when the men of Ashdod saw how things were, they said, &#8220;The ark of the God of Israel must not remain with us, for his hand is hard against us and against Dagon our god.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines and said, &#8220;What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?&#8221; They answered, &#8220;Let the ark of the God of Israel be brought around to Gath.&#8221; So they brought the ark of the God of Israel there.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But after they had brought it around, the hand of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> was against the city, causing a very great panic, and he afflicted the men of the city, both young and old, so that tumors broke out on them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. But as soon as the ark of God came to Ekron, the people of Ekron cried out, &#8220;They have brought around to us the ark of the God of Israel to kill us and our people.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines and said, &#8220;Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it return to its own place, that it may not kill us and our people.&#8221; For there was a deathly panic throughout the whole city. The hand of God was very heavy there.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>The men who did not die were struck with tumors, and the cry of the city went up to heaven.</p></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
