And they were gathered at Socoh, which belongs to Judah, and encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered, and encamped in the Valley of Elah, and drew up in line of battle against the Philistines.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And the Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side, with a valley between them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And there came out from the camp of the Philistines a champion named Goliath of Gath, whose height was six<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew; Septuagint, Dead Sea Scroll and Josephus four">a</a></sup></span> cubits<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="A cubit was about 18 inches or 45 centimeters">b</a></sup></span> and a span.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>He had a helmet of bronze on his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail, and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="A shekel was about 2/5 ounce or 11 grams">c</a></sup></span> of bronze.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And he had bronze armor on his legs, and a javelin of bronze slung between his shoulders.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>The shaft of his spear was like a weaver&#8217;s beam, and his spear&#8217;s head weighed six hundred shekels of iron. And his shield-bearer went before him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>He stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel, &#8220;Why have you come out to draw up for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves, and let him come down to me.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will be your servants. But if I prevail against him and kill him, then you shall be our servants and serve us.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And the Philistine said, &#8220;I defy the ranks of Israel this day. Give me a man, that we may fight together.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now David was the son of an Ephrathite of Bethlehem in Judah, named Jesse, who had eight sons. In the days of Saul the man was already old and advanced in years.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Septuagint, Syriac; Hebrew advanced among men">d</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>The three oldest sons of Jesse had followed Saul to the battle. And the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>David was the youngest. The three eldest followed Saul,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>but David went back and forth from Saul to feed his father&#8217;s sheep at Bethlehem.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>For forty days the Philistine came forward and took his stand, morning and evening.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And Jesse said to David his son, &#8220;Take for your brothers an ephah<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="An ephah was about 3/5 bushel or 22 liters">e</a></sup></span> of this parched grain, and these ten loaves, and carry them quickly to the camp to your brothers.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Also take these ten cheeses to the commander of their thousand. See if your brothers are well, and bring some token from them.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Now Saul and they and all the men of Israel were in the Valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And David rose early in the morning and left the sheep with a keeper and took the provisions and went, as Jesse had commanded him. And he came to the encampment as the host was going out to the battle line, shouting the war cry.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And Israel and the Philistines drew up for battle, army against army.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And David left the things in charge of the keeper of the baggage and ran to the ranks and went and greeted his brothers.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>As he talked with them, behold, the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, came up out of the ranks of the Philistines and spoke the same words as before. And David heard him.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>All the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him and were much afraid.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And the men of Israel said, &#8220;Have you seen this man who has come up? Surely he has come up to defy Israel. And the king will enrich the man who kills him with great riches and will give him his daughter and make his father&#8217;s house free in Israel.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And David said to the men who stood by him, &#8220;What shall be done for the man who kills this Philistine and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And the people answered him in the same way, &#8220;So shall it be done to the man who kills him.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Now Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spoke to the men. And Eliab&#8217;s anger was kindled against David, and he said, &#8220;Why have you come down? And with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your presumption and the evil of your heart, for you have come down to see the battle.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And David said, &#8220;What have I done now? Was it not but a word?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And he turned away from him toward another, and spoke in the same way, and the people answered him again as before.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>When the words that David spoke were heard, they repeated them before Saul, and he sent for him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And David said to Saul, &#8220;Let no man&#8217;s heart fail because of him. Your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And Saul said to David, &#8220;You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him, for you are but a youth, and he has been a man of war from his youth.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>But David said to Saul, &#8220;Your servant used to keep sheep for his father. And when there came a lion, or a bear, and took a lamb from the flock,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>I went after him and struck him and delivered it out of his mouth. And if he arose against me, I caught him by his beard and struck him and killed him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Your servant has struck down both lions and bears, and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be like one of them, for he has defied the armies of the living God.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>And David said, &#8220;The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.&#8221; And Saul said to David, &#8220;Go, and the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> be with you!&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>Then Saul clothed David with his armor. He put a helmet of bronze on his head and clothed him with a coat of mail,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>and David strapped his sword over his armor. And he tried in vain to go, for he had not tested them. Then David said to Saul, &#8220;I cannot go with these, for I have not tested them.&#8221; So David put them off.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>Then he took his staff in his hand and chose five smooth stones from the brook and put them in his shepherd&#8217;s pouch. His sling was in his hand, and he approached the Philistine.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>And the Philistine moved forward and came near to David, with his shield-bearer in front of him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>And when the Philistine looked and saw David, he disdained him, for he was but a youth, ruddy and handsome in appearance.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>And the Philistine said to David, &#8220;Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?&#8221; And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>The Philistine said to David, &#8220;Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the air and to the beasts of the field.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>Then David said to the Philistine, &#8220;You come to me with a sword and with a spear and with a javelin, but I come to you in the name of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span>This day the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you down and cut off your head. And I will give the dead bodies of the host of the Philistines this day to the birds of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth, that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-47.htm"><b>47</b></a></span>and that all this assembly may know that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> saves not with sword and spear. For the battle is the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s, and he will give you into our hand.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-48.htm"><b>48</b></a></span>When the Philistine arose and came and drew near to meet David, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the Philistine.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-49.htm"><b>49</b></a></span>And David put his hand in his bag and took out a stone and slung it and struck the Philistine on his forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the ground.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-50.htm"><b>50</b></a></span>So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and struck the Philistine and killed him. There was no sword in the hand of David.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-51.htm"><b>51</b></a></span>Then David ran and stood over the Philistine and took his sword and drew it out of its sheath and killed him and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-52.htm"><b>52</b></a></span>And the men of Israel and Judah rose with a shout and pursued the Philistines as far as Gath<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Septuagint; Hebrew Gai">f</a></sup></span> and the gates of Ekron, so that the wounded Philistines fell on the way from Shaaraim as far as Gath and Ekron.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-53.htm"><b>53</b></a></span>And the people of Israel came back from chasing the Philistines, and they plundered their camp.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-54.htm"><b>54</b></a></span>And David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put his armor in his tent.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-55.htm"><b>55</b></a></span>As soon as Saul saw David go out against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the commander of the army, &#8220;Abner, whose son is this youth?&#8221; And Abner said, &#8220;As your soul lives, O king, I do not know.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-56.htm"><b>56</b></a></span>And the king said, &#8220;Inquire whose son the boy is.&#8221;
