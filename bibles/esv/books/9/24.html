<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel and went to seek David and his men in front of the Wildgoats&#8217; Rocks.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And he came to the sheepfolds by the way, where there was a cave, and Saul went in to relieve himself.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew cover his feet">b</a></sup></span> Now David and his men were sitting in the innermost parts of the cave.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And the men of David said to him, &#8220;Here is the day of which the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to you, &#8216;Behold, I will give your enemy into your hand, and you shall do to him as it shall seem good to you.&#8217;&#8221; Then David arose and stealthily cut off a corner of Saul&#8217;s robe.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And afterward David&#8217;s heart struck him, because he had cut off a corner of Saul&#8217;s robe.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>He said to his men, &#8220;The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> forbid that I should do this thing to my lord, the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s anointed, to put out my hand against him, seeing he is the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s anointed.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So David persuaded his men with these words and did not permit them to attack Saul. And Saul rose up and left the cave and went on his way.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Afterward David also arose and went out of the cave, and called after Saul, &#8220;My lord the king!&#8221; And when Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth and paid homage.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And David said to Saul, &#8220;Why do you listen to the words of men who say, &#8216;Behold, David seeks your harm&#8217;?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Behold, this day your eyes have seen how the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> gave you today into my hand in the cave. And some told me to kill you, but I spared you.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Septuagint, Syriac, Targum; Hebrew it [my eye] spared you">c</a></sup></span> I said, &#8216;I will not put out my hand against my lord, for he is the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s anointed.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>See, my father, see the corner of your robe in my hand. For by the fact that I cut off the corner of your robe and did not kill you, you may know and see that there is no wrong or treason in my hands. I have not sinned against you, though you hunt my life to take it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>May the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> judge between me and you, may the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> avenge me against you, but my hand shall not be against you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>As the proverb of the ancients says, &#8216;Out of the wicked comes wickedness.&#8217; But my hand shall not be against you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>After whom has the king of Israel come out? After whom do you pursue? After a dead dog! After a flea!
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>May the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> therefore be judge and give sentence between me and you, and see to it and plead my cause and deliver me from your hand.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>As soon as David had finished speaking these words to Saul, Saul said, &#8220;Is this your voice, my son David?&#8221; And Saul lifted up his voice and wept.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>He said to David, &#8220;You are more righteous than I, for you have repaid me good, whereas I have repaid you evil.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And you have declared this day how you have dealt well with me, in that you did not kill me when the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> put me into your hands.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go away safe? So may the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> reward you with good for what you have done to me this day.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And now, behold, I know that you shall surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hand.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Swear to me therefore by the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> that you will not cut off my offspring after me, and that you will not destroy my name out of my father&#8217;s house.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And David swore this to Saul. Then Saul went home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold.</p><A name="footnotes"></a><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">1</span> Ch 24:2 in Hebrew<br /><span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">3</span> Hebrew <i>cover his feet</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <span class="fnverse">10</span> Septuagint, Syriac, Targum; Hebrew <i>it</i> [my eye] <i>spared you</i><br /></span></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
