<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts, &#8216;I have noted what Amalek did to Israel in opposing them on the way when they came up out of Egypt.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Now go and strike Amalek and devote to destruction<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, set apart (devote) as an offering to the Lord (for destruction); also verses 8, 9, 15, 18, 20, 21">a</a></sup></span> all that they have.

<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So Saul summoned the people and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand men on foot, and ten thousand men of Judah.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And Saul came to the city of Amalek and lay in wait in the valley.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then Saul said to the Kenites, &#8220;Go, depart; go down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them. For you showed kindness to all the people of Israel when they came up out of Egypt.&#8221; So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And Saul defeated the Amalekites from Havilah as far as Shur, which is east of Egypt.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive and devoted to destruction all the people with the edge of the sword.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the sheep and of the oxen and of the fattened calves<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="The meaning of the Hebrew term is uncertain">b</a></sup></span> and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them. All that was despised and worthless they devoted to destruction.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>The word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> came to Samuel:
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8220;I regret<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="See also verses 29, 35">c</a></sup></span> that I have made Saul king, for he has turned back from following me and has not performed my commandments.&#8221; And Samuel was angry, and he cried to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> all night.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning. And it was told Samuel, &#8220;Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he set up a monument for himself and turned and passed on and went down to Gilgal.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And Samuel came to Saul, and Saul said to him, &#8220;Blessed be you to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. I have performed the commandment of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And Samuel said, &#8220;What then is this bleating of the sheep in my ears and the lowing of the oxen that I hear?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Saul said, &#8220;They have brought them from the Amalekites, for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen to sacrifice to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God, and the rest we have devoted to destruction.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then Samuel said to Saul, &#8220;Stop! I will tell you what the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to me this night.&#8221; And he said to him, &#8220;Speak.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And Samuel said, &#8220;Though you are little in your own eyes, are you not the head of the tribes of Israel? The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> anointed you king over Israel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> sent you on a mission and said, &#8216;Go, devote to destruction the sinners, the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are consumed.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Why then did you not obey the voice of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>? Why did you pounce on the spoil and do what was evil in the sight of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And Saul said to Samuel, &#8220;I have obeyed the voice of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the best of the things devoted to destruction, to sacrifice to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God in Gilgal.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And Samuel said,</p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">&#8220;Has the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices,</span><br /><span class="indent">as in obeying the voice of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>?</span><br /><span class="ln-group">Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice,</span><br /><span class="indent">and to listen than the fat of rams.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span><span class="ln-group">For rebellion is as the sin of divination,</span><br /><span class="indent">and presumption is as iniquity and idolatry.</span><br /><span class="ln-group">Because you have rejected the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>,</span><br /><span class="indent">he has also rejected you from being king.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Saul said to Samuel, &#8220;I have sinned, for I have transgressed the commandment of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and your words, because I feared the people and obeyed their voice.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Now therefore, please pardon my sin and return with me that I may bow before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And Samuel said to Saul, &#8220;I will not return with you.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>As Samuel turned to go away, Saul seized the skirt of his robe, and it tore.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And also the Glory of Israel will not lie or have regret, for he is not a man, that he should have regret.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Then he said, &#8220;I have sinned; yet honor me now before the elders of my people and before Israel, and return with me, that I may bow before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>So Samuel turned back after Saul, and Saul bowed before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Then Samuel said, &#8220;Bring here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites.&#8221; And Agag came to him cheerfully.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or haltingly (compare Septuagint); the Hebrew is uncertain">d</a></sup></span> Agag said, &#8220;Surely the bitterness of death is past.&#8221;
