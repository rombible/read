<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And now, behold, the king walks before you, and I am old and gray; and behold, my sons are with you. I have walked before you from my youth until this day.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Here I am; testify against me before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and before his anointed. Whose ox have I taken? Or whose donkey have I taken? Or whom have I defrauded? Whom have I oppressed? Or from whose hand have I taken a bribe to blind my eyes with it? Testify against me<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Septuagint; Hebrew lacks Testify against me">a</a></sup></span> and I will restore it to you.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>They said, &#8220;You have not defrauded us or oppressed us or taken anything from any man&#8217;s hand.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And he said to them, &#8220;The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand.&#8221; And they said, &#8220;He is witness.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And Samuel said to the people, &#8220;The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> is witness,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Septuagint; Hebrew lacks is witness">b</a></sup></span> who appointed Moses and Aaron and brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now therefore stand still that I may plead with you before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> concerning all the righteous deeds of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> that he performed for you and for your fathers.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>When Jacob went into Egypt, and the Egyptians oppressed them,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Septuagint; Hebrew lacks and the Egyptians oppressed them">c</a></sup></span> then your fathers cried out to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> sent Moses and Aaron, who brought your fathers out of Egypt and made them dwell in this place.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But they forgot the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> their God. And he sold them into the hand of Sisera, commander of the army of Hazor,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Septuagint the army of Jabin king of Hazor">d</a></sup></span> and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab. And they fought against them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And they cried out to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and said, &#8216;We have sinned, because we have forsaken the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and have served the Baals and the Ashtaroth. But now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, that we may serve you.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> sent Jerubbaal and Barak<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Septuagint, Syriac; Hebrew Bedan">e</a></sup></span> and Jephthah and Samuel and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and you lived in safety.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And when you saw that Nahash the king of the Ammonites came against you, you said to me, &#8216;No, but a king shall reign over us,&#8217; when the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God was your king.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And now behold the king whom you have chosen, for whom you have asked; behold, the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has set a king over you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>If you will fear the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and serve him and obey his voice and not rebel against the commandment of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and if both you and the king who reigns over you will follow the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God, it will be well.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But if you will not obey the voice of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, but rebel against the commandment of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, then the hand of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> will be against you and your king.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Septuagint; Hebrew fathers">f</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Now therefore stand still and see this great thing that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> will do before your eyes.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Is it not wheat harvest today? I will call upon the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, that he may send thunder and rain. And you shall know and see that your wickedness is great, which you have done in the sight of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, in asking for yourselves a king.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>So Samuel called upon the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> sent thunder and rain that day, and all the people greatly feared the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and Samuel.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And all the people said to Samuel, &#8220;Pray for your servants to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God, that we may not die, for we have added to all our sins this evil, to ask for ourselves a king.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And Samuel said to the people, &#8220;Do not be afraid; you have done all this evil. Yet do not turn aside from following the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, but serve the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> with all your heart.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And do not turn aside after empty things that cannot profit or deliver, for they are empty.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>For the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> will not forsake his people, for his great name&#8217;s sake, because it has pleased the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> to make you a people for himself.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Moreover, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> by ceasing to pray for you, and I will instruct you in the good and the right way.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Only fear the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and serve him faithfully with all your heart. For consider what great things he has done for you.
