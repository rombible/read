<p class="heading">Eli&#8217;s Worthless Sons</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now the sons of Eli were worthless men. They did not know the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>The custom of the priests with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice, the priest&#8217;s servant would come, while the meat was boiling, with a three-pronged fork in his hand,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>and he would thrust it into the pan or kettle or cauldron or pot. All that the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. This is what they did at Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Moreover, before the fat was burned, the priest&#8217;s servant would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, &#8220;Give meat for the priest to roast, for he will not accept boiled meat from you but only raw.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And if the man said to him, &#8220;Let them burn the fat first, and then take as much as you wish,&#8221; he would say, &#8220;No, you must give it now, and if not, I will take it by force.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Thus the sin of the young men was very great in the sight of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, for the men treated the offering of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> with contempt.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Samuel was ministering before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, a boy clothed with a linen ephod.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, and say, &#8220;May the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> give you children by this woman for the petition she asked of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221; So then they would return to their home.</p>

<p class="heading">Eli Rebukes His Sons</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Now Eli was very old, and he kept hearing all that his sons were doing to all Israel, and how they lay with the women who were serving at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And he said to them, &#8220;Why do you do such things? For I hear of your evil dealings from all these people.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me?
