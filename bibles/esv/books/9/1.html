<div class="chap"><p class="heading">The Birth of Samuel</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>There was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim of the hill country of Ephraim whose name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham, son of Elihu, son of Tohu, son of Zuph, an Ephrathite.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>He had two wives. The name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other, Peninnah. And Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Now this man used to go up year by year from his city to worship and to sacrifice to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts at Shiloh, where the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>On the day when Elkanah sacrificed, he would give portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and daughters.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But to Hannah he gave a double portion, because he loved her, though the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> had closed her womb.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Syriac; the meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain. Septuagint And, although he loved Hannah, he would give Hannah only one portion, because the LORD had closed her womb">a</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And her rival used to provoke her grievously to irritate her, because the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> had closed her womb.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So it went on year by year. As often as she went up to the house of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, she used to provoke her. Therefore Hannah wept and would not eat.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And Elkanah, her husband, said to her, &#8220;Hannah, why do you weep? And why do you not eat? And why is your heart sad? Am I not more to you than ten sons?&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>After they had eaten and drunk in Shiloh, Hannah rose. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat beside the doorpost of the temple of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>She was deeply distressed and prayed to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and wept bitterly.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And she vowed a vow and said, &#8220;O <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts, if you will indeed look on the affliction of your servant and remember me and not forget your servant, but will give to your servant a son, then I will give him to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> all the days of his life, and no razor shall touch his head.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>As she continued praying before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, Eli observed her mouth.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Hannah was speaking in her heart; only her lips moved, and her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli took her to be a drunken woman.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And Eli said to her, &#8220;How long will you go on being drunk? Put your wine away from you.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But Hannah answered, &#8220;No, my lord, I am a woman troubled in spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I have been pouring out my soul before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Do not regard your servant as a worthless woman, for all along I have been speaking out of my great anxiety and vexation.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then Eli answered, &#8220;Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant your petition that you have made to him.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And she said, &#8220;Let your servant find favor in your eyes.&#8221; Then the woman went her way and ate, and her face was no longer sad.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>They rose early in the morning and worshiped before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>; then they went back to their house at Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife, and the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> remembered her.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And in due time Hannah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Samuel, for she said, &#8220;I have asked for him from the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221;<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Samuel sounds like the Hebrew for heard of God">b</a></sup></span></p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, &#8220;As soon as the child is weaned, I will bring him, so that he may appear in the presence of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and dwell there forever.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Elkanah her husband said to her, &#8220;Do what seems best to you; wait until you have weaned him; only, may the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> establish his word.&#8221; So the woman remained and nursed her son until she weaned him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, along with a three-year-old bull,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Dead Sea Scroll, Septuagint, Syriac; Masoretic Text three bulls">c</a></sup></span> an ephah<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="An ephah was about 3/5 bushel or 22 liters">d</a></sup></span> of flour, and a skin of wine, and she brought him to the house of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> at Shiloh.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then they slaughtered the bull, and they brought the child to Eli.
