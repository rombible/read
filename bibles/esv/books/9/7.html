<div class="chap"><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>And the men of Kiriath-jearim came and took up the ark of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and brought it to the house of Abinadab on the hill. And they consecrated his son Eleazar to have charge of the ark of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>From the day that the ark was lodged at Kiriath-jearim, a long time passed, some twenty years, and all the house of Israel lamented after the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.</p>
<p class="heading">Samuel Judges Israel</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And Samuel said to all the house of Israel, &#8220;If you are returning to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> with all your heart, then put away the foreign gods and the Ashtaroth from among you and direct your heart to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and serve him only, and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So the people of Israel put away the Baals and the Ashtaroth, and they served the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> only.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then Samuel said, &#8220;Gather all Israel at Mizpah, and I will pray to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> for you.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So they gathered at Mizpah and drew water and poured it out before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and fasted on that day and said there, &#8220;We have sinned against the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221; And Samuel judged the people of Israel at Mizpah.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now when the Philistines heard that the people of Israel had gathered at Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the people of Israel heard of it, they were afraid of the Philistines.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And the people of Israel said to Samuel, &#8220;Do not cease to cry out to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> our God for us, that he may save us from the hand of the Philistines.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So Samuel took a nursing lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. And Samuel cried out to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> for Israel, and the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> answered him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>As Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to attack Israel. But the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> thundered with a mighty sound that day against the Philistines and threw them into confusion, and they were defeated before Israel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And the men of Israel went out from Mizpah and pursued the Philistines and struck them, as far as below Beth-car.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew; Septuagint, Syriac Jeshanah">a</a></sup></span> and called its name Ebenezer;<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Ebenezer means stone of help">b</a></sup></span> for he said, &#8220;Till now the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has helped us.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So the Philistines were subdued and did not again enter the territory of Israel. And the hand of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>The cities that the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron to Gath, and Israel delivered their territory from the hand of the Philistines. There was peace also between Israel and the Amorites.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And he went on a circuit year by year to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah. And he judged Israel in all these places.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then he would return to Ramah, for his home was there, and there also he judged Israel. And he built there an altar to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.</p><A name="footnotes"></a><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">12</span> Hebrew; Septuagint, Syriac <i>Jeshanah</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">12</span> <i class="catch-word">Ebenezer</i> means <i>stone of help</i><br /></span></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
