And Ahimelech came to meet David, trembling, and said to him, &#8220;Why are you alone, and no one with you?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And David said to Ahimelech the priest, &#8220;The king has charged me with a matter and said to me, &#8216;Let no one know anything of the matter about which I send you, and with which I have charged you.&#8217; I have made an appointment with the young men for such and such a place.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Now then, what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever is here.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And the priest answered David, &#8220;I have no common bread on hand, but there is holy bread&#8212;if the young men have kept themselves from women.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And David answered the priest, &#8220;Truly women have been kept from us as always when I go on an expedition. The vessels of the young men are holy even when it is an ordinary journey. How much more today will their vessels be holy?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So the priest gave him the holy bread, for there was no bread there but the bread of the Presence, which is removed from before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, to be replaced by hot bread on the day it is taken away.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. His name was Doeg the Edomite, the chief of Saul&#8217;s herdsmen.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then David said to Ahimelech, &#8220;Then have you not here a spear or a sword at hand? For I have brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king&#8217;s business required haste.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And the priest said, &#8220;The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you struck down in the Valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you will take that, take it, for there is none but that here.&#8221; And David said, &#8220;There is none like that; give it to me.&#8221;</p>
<p class="heading">David Flees to Gath</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And David rose and fled that day from Saul and went to Achish the king of Gath.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And the servants of Achish said to him, &#8220;Is not this David the king of the land? Did they not sing to one another of him in dances,</p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">&#8216;Saul has struck down his thousands,</span><br /><span class="indent">and David his ten thousands&#8217;?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="same-paragraph"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And David took these words to heart and was much afraid of Achish the king of Gath.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So he changed his behavior before them and pretended to be insane in their hands and made marks on the doors of the gate and let his spittle run down his beard.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then Achish said to his servants, &#8220;Behold, you see the man is mad. Why then have you brought him to me?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Do I lack madmen, that you have brought this fellow to behave as a madman in my presence? Shall this fellow come into my house?&#8221;</p><A name="footnotes"></a><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">1</span> Ch 21:2 in Hebrew<br /></span></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
