<div class="chap"><p class="heading">David at the Cave of Adullam</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>David departed from there and escaped to the cave of Adullam. And when his brothers and all his father&#8217;s house heard it, they went down there to him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And everyone who was in distress, and everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was bitter in soul,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or discontented">a</a></sup></span> gathered to him. And he became commander over them. And there were with him about four hundred men.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And David went from there to Mizpeh of Moab. And he said to the king of Moab, &#8220;Please let my father and my mother stay<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Syriac, Vulgate; Hebrew go out">b</a></sup></span> with you, till I know what God will do for me.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And he left them with the king of Moab, and they stayed with him all the time that David was in the stronghold.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then the prophet Gad said to David, &#8220;Do not remain in the stronghold; depart, and go into the land of Judah.&#8221; So David departed and went into the forest of Hereth.</p>
<p class="heading">Saul Kills the Priests at Nob</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men who were with him. Saul was sitting at Gibeah under the tamarisk tree on the height with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And Saul said to his servants who stood about him, &#8220;Hear now, people of Benjamin; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, will he make you all commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>that all of you have conspired against me? No one discloses to me when my son makes a covenant with the son of Jesse. None of you is sorry for me or discloses to me that my son has stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then answered Doeg the Edomite, who stood by the servants of Saul, &#8220;I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and he inquired of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> for him and gave him provisions and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then the king sent to summon Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father&#8217;s house, the priests who were at Nob, and all of them came to the king.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And Saul said, &#8220;Hear now, son of Ahitub.&#8221; And he answered, &#8220;Here I am, my lord.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And Saul said to him, &#8220;Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, in that you have given him bread and a sword and have inquired of God for him, so that he has risen against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then Ahimelech answered the king, &#8220;And who among all your servants is so faithful as David, who is the king&#8217;s son-in-law, and captain over<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Septuagint, Targum; Hebrew and has turned aside to">c</a></sup></span> your bodyguard, and honored in your house?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Is today the first time that I have inquired of God for him? No! Let not the king impute anything to his servant or to all the house of my father, for your servant has known nothing of all this, much or little.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And the king said, &#8220;You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you and all your father&#8217;s house.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And the king said to the guard who stood about him, &#8220;Turn and kill the priests of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, because their hand also is with David, and they knew that he fled and did not disclose it to me.&#8221; But the servants of the king would not put out their hand to strike the priests of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then the king said to Doeg, &#8220;You turn and strike the priests.&#8221; And Doeg the Edomite turned and struck down the priests, and he killed on that day eighty-five persons who wore the linen ephod.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And Nob, the city of the priests, he put to the sword; both man and woman, child and infant, ox, donkey and sheep, he put to the sword.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>But one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped and fled after David.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And Abiathar told David that Saul had killed the priests of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And David said to Abiathar, &#8220;I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul. I have occasioned the death of all the persons of your father&#8217;s house.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Stay with me; do not be afraid, for he who seeks my life seeks your life.
