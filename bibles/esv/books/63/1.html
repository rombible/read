<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_john/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>because of the truth that abides in us and will be with us forever:</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_john/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father and from Jesus Christ the Father&#8217;s Son, in truth and love.</p>
<p class="heading">Walking in Truth and Love</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_john/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>I rejoiced greatly to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as we were commanded by the Father.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_john/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And now I ask you, dear lady&#8212;not as though I were writing you a new commandment, but the one we have had from the beginning&#8212;that we love one another.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_john/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And this is love, that we walk according to his commandments; this is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, so that you should walk in it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_john/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh. Such a one is the deceiver and the antichrist.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_john/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Watch yourselves, so that you may not lose what we<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts you">a</a></sup></span> have worked for, but may win a full reward.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_john/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Everyone who goes on ahead and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God. Whoever abides in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_john/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house or give him any greeting,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_john/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>for whoever greets him takes part in his wicked works.</p>
<p class="heading">Final Greetings</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_john/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Though I have much to write to you, I would rather not use paper and ink. Instead I hope to come to you and talk face to face, so that our joy may be complete.</p>
