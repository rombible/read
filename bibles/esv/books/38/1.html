<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> was very angry with your fathers.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Therefore say to them, Thus declares the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts: Return to me, says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts, and I will return to you, says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Do not be like your fathers, to whom the former prophets cried out, &#8216;Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts, Return from your evil ways and from your evil deeds.&#8217; But they did not hear or pay attention to me, declares the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not overtake your fathers? So they repented and said, &#8216;As the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts purposed to deal with us for our ways and deeds, so has he dealt with us.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p class="heading">A Vision of a Horseman</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> came to the prophet Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, son of Iddo, saying,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8220;I saw in the night, and behold, a man riding on a red horse! He was standing among the myrtle trees in the glen, and behind him were red, sorrel, and white horses.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then I said, &#8216;What are these, my lord?&#8217; The angel who talked with me said to me, &#8216;I will show you what they are.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered, &#8216;These are they whom the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has sent to patrol the earth.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And they answered the angel of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> who was standing among the myrtle trees, and said, &#8216;We have patrolled the earth, and behold, all the earth remains at rest.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then the angel of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said, &#8216;O <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts, how long will you have no mercy on Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, against which you have been angry these seventy years?&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> answered gracious and comforting words to the angel who talked with me.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So the angel who talked with me said to me, &#8216;Cry out, Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts: I am exceedingly jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And I am exceedingly angry with the nations that are at ease; for while I was angry but a little, they furthered the disaster.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Therefore, thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, I have returned to Jerusalem with mercy; my house shall be built in it, declares the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts, and the measuring line shall be stretched out over Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Cry out again, Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts: My cities shall again overflow with prosperity, and the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> will again comfort Zion and again choose Jerusalem.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
