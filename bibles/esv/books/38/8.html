<div class="chap"><p class="heading">The Coming Peace and Prosperity of Zion</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>And the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts came, saying,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts: I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I am jealous for her with great wrath.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>: I have returned to Zion and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem, and Jerusalem shall be called the faithful city, and the mountain of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts, the holy mountain.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts: Old men and old women shall again sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each with staff in hand because of great age.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in its streets.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts: If it is marvelous in the sight of the remnant of this people in those days, should it also be marvelous in my sight, declares the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts: Behold, I will save my people from the east country and from the west country,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>and I will bring them to dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in faithfulness and in righteousness.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts: &#8220;Let your hands be strong, you who in these days have been hearing these words from the mouth of the prophets who were present on the day that the foundation of the house of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts was laid, that the temple might be built.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For before those days there was no wage for man or any wage for beast, neither was there any safety from the foe for him who went out or came in, for I set every man against his neighbor.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But now I will not deal with the remnant of this people as in the former days, declares the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>For there shall be a sowing of peace. The vine shall give its fruit, and the ground shall give its produce, and the heavens shall give their dew. And I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And as you have been a byword of cursing among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so will I save you, and you shall be a blessing. Fear not, but let your hands be strong.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts: &#8220;As I purposed to bring disaster to you when your fathers provoked me to wrath, and I did not relent, says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>so again have I purposed in these days to bring good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah; fear not.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>These are the things that you shall do: Speak the truth to one another; render in your gates judgments that are true and make for peace;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>do not devise evil in your hearts against one another, and love no false oath, for all these things I hate, declares the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts came to me, saying,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>&#8220;Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts: The fast of the fourth month and the fast of the fifth and the fast of the seventh and the fast of the tenth shall be to the house of Judah seasons of joy and gladness and cheerful feasts. Therefore love truth and peace.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>&#8220;Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts: Peoples shall yet come, even the inhabitants of many cities.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>The inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying, &#8216;Let us go at once to entreat the favor of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and to seek the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts; I myself am going.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Many peoples and strong nations shall come to seek the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts in Jerusalem and to entreat the favor of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts: In those days ten men from the nations of every tongue shall take hold of the robe of a Jew, saying, &#8216;Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.&#8217;&#8221;</p></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
