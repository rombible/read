<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Behold, I am about to make Jerusalem a cup of staggering to all the surrounding peoples. The siege of Jerusalem will also be against Judah.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>On that day I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples. All who lift it will surely hurt themselves. And all the nations of the earth will gather against it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>On that day, declares the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, I will strike every horse with panic, and its rider with madness. But for the sake of the house of Judah I will keep my eyes open, when I strike every horse of the peoples with blindness.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then the clans of Judah shall say to themselves, &#8216;The inhabitants of Jerusalem have strength through the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts, their God.&#8217;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>&#8220;On that day I will make the clans of Judah like a blazing pot in the midst of wood, like a flaming torch among sheaves. And they shall devour to the right and to the left all the surrounding peoples, while Jerusalem shall again be inhabited in its place, in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8220;And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> will give salvation to the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem may not surpass that of Judah.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>On that day the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> will protect the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the feeblest among them on that day shall be like David, and the house of David shall be like God, like the angel of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, going before them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And on that day I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>On that day the mourning in Jerusalem will be as great as the mourning for Hadad-rimmon in the plain of Megiddo.
