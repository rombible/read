<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to Satan, &#8220;The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> rebuke you, O Satan!

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Now Joshua was standing before the angel, clothed with filthy garments.
