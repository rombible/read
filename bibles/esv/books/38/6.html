And the mountains were mountains of bronze.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>The first chariot had red horses, the second black horses,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>the third white horses, and the fourth chariot dappled horses&#8212;all of them strong.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or and the fourth chariot strong dappled horses">a</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then I answered and said to the angel who talked with me, &#8220;What are these, my lord?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And the angel answered and said to me, &#8220;These are going out to the four winds of heaven, after presenting themselves before the Lord of all the earth.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>The chariot with the black horses goes toward the north country, the white ones go after them, and the dappled ones go toward the south country.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>When the strong horses came out, they were impatient to go and patrol the earth. And he said, &#8220;Go, patrol the earth.&#8221; So they patrolled the earth.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then he cried to me, &#8220;Behold, those who go toward the north country have set my Spirit at rest in the north country.&#8221;</p>
