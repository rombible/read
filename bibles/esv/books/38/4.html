<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he said to me, &#8220;What do you see?&#8221; I said, &#8220;I see, and behold, a lampstand all of gold, with a bowl on the top of it, and seven lamps on it, with seven lips on each of the lamps that are on the top of it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And there are two olive trees by it, one on the right of the bowl and the other on its left.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And I said to the angel who talked with me, &#8220;What are these, my lord?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then the angel who talked with me answered and said to me, &#8220;Do you not know what these are?&#8221; I said, &#8220;No, my lord.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then he said to me, &#8220;This is the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> to Zerubbabel: Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Who are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you shall become a plain. And he shall bring forward the top stone amid shouts of &#8216;Grace, grace to it!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> came to me, saying,
