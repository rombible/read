<div class="chap"><p class="heading">A Call for Justice and Mercy</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, which is Chislev.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Now the people of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regem-melech and their men to entreat the favor of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>saying to the priests of the house of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts and the prophets, &#8220;Should I weep and abstain in the fifth month, as I have done for so many years?&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts came to me:
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8220;Say to all the people of the land and the priests, &#8216;When you fasted and mourned in the fifth month and in the seventh, for these seventy years, was it for me that you fasted?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And when you eat and when you drink, do you not eat for yourselves and drink for yourselves?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Were not these the words that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous, with her cities around her, and the South and the lowland were inhabited?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> came to Zechariah, saying,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts, Render true judgments, show kindness and mercy to one another,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>do not oppress the widow, the fatherless, the sojourner, or the poor, and let none of you devise evil against another in your heart.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But they refused to pay attention and turned a stubborn shoulder and stopped their ears that they might not hear.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew and made their ears too heavy to hear">a</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>They made their hearts diamond-hard lest they should hear the law and the words that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts had sent by his Spirit through the former prophets. Therefore great anger came from the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8220;As I<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew he">b</a></sup></span> called, and they would not hear, so they called, and I would not hear,&#8221; says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>&#8220;and I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations that they had not known. Thus the land they left was desolate, so that no one went to and fro, and the pleasant land was made desolate.&#8221;</p><A name="footnotes"></a><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">11</span> Hebrew <i>and made their ears too heavy to hear</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">13</span> Hebrew <i>he</i><br /></span></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
