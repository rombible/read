<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/17-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he said to his mother, &#8220;The 1,100 pieces of silver that were taken from you, about which you uttered a curse, and also spoke it in my ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it.&#8221; And his mother said, &#8220;Blessed be my son by the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/17-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And he restored the 1,100 pieces of silver to his mother. And his mother said, &#8220;I dedicate the silver to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> from my hand for my son, to make a carved image and a metal image. Now therefore I will restore it to you.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/17-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So when he restored the money to his mother, his mother took 200 pieces of silver and gave it to the silversmith, who made it into a carved image and a metal image. And it was in the house of Micah.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/17-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And the man Micah had a shrine, and he made an ephod and household gods, and ordained<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew filled the hand of; also verse 12">a</a></sup></span> one of his sons, who became his priest.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/17-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did what was right in his own eyes.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/17-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now there was a young man of Bethlehem in Judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/17-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And the man departed from the town of Bethlehem in Judah to sojourn where he could find a place. And as he journeyed, he came to the hill country of Ephraim to the house of Micah.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/17-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And Micah said to him, &#8220;Where do you come from?&#8221; And he said to him, &#8220;I am a Levite of Bethlehem in Judah, and I am going to sojourn where I may find a place.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/17-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And Micah said to him, &#8220;Stay with me, and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give you ten pieces of silver a year and a suit of clothes and your living.&#8221; And the Levite went in.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/17-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And the Levite was content to dwell with the man, and the young man became to him like one of his sons.
