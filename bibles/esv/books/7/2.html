<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Israel&#8217;s Disobedience</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Now the angel of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> went up from Gilgal to Bochim. And he said, &#8220;I brought you up from Egypt and brought you into the land that I swore to give to your fathers. I said, &#8216;I will never break my covenant with you,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and you shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; you shall break down their altars.&#8217; But you have not obeyed my voice. What is this you have done?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So now I say, I will not drive them out before you, but they shall become thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare to you.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>As soon as the angel of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> spoke these words to all the people of Israel, the people lifted up their voices and wept.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And they called the name of that place Bochim.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Bochim means weepers">a</a></sup></span> And they sacrificed there to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.</p>
<p class="heading">The Death of Joshua</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>When Joshua dismissed the people, the people of Israel went each to his inheritance to take possession of the land.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And the people served the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> had done for Israel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, died at the age of 110 years.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And they buried him within the boundaries of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, north of the mountain of Gaash.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And all that generation also were gathered to their fathers. And there arose another generation after them who did not know the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> or the work that he had done for Israel.</p>
<p class="heading">Israel&#8217;s Unfaithfulness</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And the people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and served the Baals.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And they abandoned the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt. They went after other gods, from among the gods of the peoples who were around them, and bowed down to them. And they provoked the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> to anger.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>They abandoned the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and served the Baals and the Ashtaroth.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So the anger of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> was kindled against Israel, and he gave them over to plunderers, who plundered them. And he sold them into the hand of their surrounding enemies, so that they could no longer withstand their enemies.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Whenever they marched out, the hand of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> was against them for harm, as the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> had warned, and as the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> had sworn to them. And they were in terrible distress.</p>
<p class="heading">The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> Raises Up Judges</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> raised up judges, who saved them out of the hand of those who plundered them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Yet they did not listen to their judges, for they whored after other gods and bowed down to them. They soon turned aside from the way in which their fathers had walked, who had obeyed the commandments of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and they did not do so.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Whenever the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> raised up judges for them, the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> was with the judge, and he saved them from the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge. For the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> was moved to pity by their groaning because of those who afflicted and oppressed them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>But whenever the judge died, they turned back and were more corrupt than their fathers, going after other gods, serving them and bowing down to them. They did not drop any of their practices or their stubborn ways.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So the anger of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> was kindled against Israel, and he said, &#8220;Because this people have transgressed my covenant that I commanded their fathers and have not obeyed my voice,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>I will no longer drive out before them any of the nations that Joshua left when he died,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>in order to test Israel by them, whether they will take care to walk in the way of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> as their fathers did, or not.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>So the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> left those nations, not driving them out quickly, and he did not give them into the hand of Joshua.</p><A name="footnotes"></a><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">5</span> <i class="catch-word">Bochim</i> means <i>weepers</i><br /></span></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
