We will burn your house over you with fire.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/12-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Jephthah said to them, &#8220;I and my people had a great dispute with the Ammonites, and when I called you, you did not save me from their hand.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/12-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And when I saw that you would not save me, I took my life in my hand and crossed over against the Ammonites, and the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> gave them into my hand. Why then have you come up to me this day to fight against me?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/12-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then Jephthah gathered all the men of Gilead and fought with Ephraim.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/12-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And the Gileadites captured the fords of the Jordan against the Ephraimites. And when any of the fugitives of Ephraim said, &#8220;Let me go over,&#8221; the men of Gilead said to him, &#8220;Are you an Ephraimite?&#8221; When he said, &#8220;No,&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/12-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>they said to him, &#8220;Then say Shibboleth,&#8221; and he said, &#8220;Sibboleth,&#8221; for he could not pronounce it right. Then they seized him and slaughtered him at the fords of the Jordan. At that time 42,000 of the Ephraimites fell.</p>
