<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Boaz Redeems Ruth</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Now Boaz had gone up to the gate and sat down there. And behold, the redeemer, of whom Boaz had spoken, came by. So Boaz said, &#8220;Turn aside, friend; sit down here.&#8221; And he turned aside and sat down.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he took ten men of the elders of the city and said, &#8220;Sit down here.&#8221; So they sat down.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then he said to the redeemer, &#8220;Naomi, who has come back from the country of Moab, is selling the parcel of land that belonged to our relative Elimelech.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So I thought I would tell you of it and say, &#8216;Buy it in the presence of those sitting here and in the presence of the elders of my people.&#8217; If you will redeem it, redeem it. But if you<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew he">a</a></sup></span> will not, tell me, that I may know, for there is no one besides you to redeem it, and I come after you.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;I will redeem it.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then Boaz said, &#8220;The day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi, you also acquire Ruth<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Masoretic Text you also buy it from Ruth">b</a></sup></span> the Moabite, the widow of the dead, in order to perpetuate the name of the dead in his inheritance.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then the redeemer said, &#8220;I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I impair my own inheritance. Take my right of redemption yourself, for I cannot redeem it.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now this was the custom in former times in Israel concerning redeeming and exchanging: to confirm a transaction, the one drew off his sandal and gave it to the other, and this was the manner of attesting in Israel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So when the redeemer said to Boaz, &#8220;Buy it for yourself,&#8221; he drew off his sandal.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then Boaz said to the elders and all the people, &#8220;You are witnesses this day that I have bought from the hand of Naomi all that belonged to Elimelech and all that belonged to Chilion and to Mahlon.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Also Ruth the Moabite, the widow of Mahlon, I have bought to be my wife, to perpetuate the name of the dead in his inheritance, that the name of the dead may not be cut off from among his brothers and from the gate of his native place. You are witnesses this day.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then all the people who were at the gate and the elders said, &#8220;We are witnesses. May the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> make the woman, who is coming into your house, like Rachel and Leah, who together built up the house of Israel. May you act worthily in Ephrathah and be renowned in Bethlehem,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>and may your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, because of the offspring that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> will give you by this young woman.&#8221;</p>
<p class="heading">Ruth and Boaz Marry</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife. And he went in to her, and the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> gave her conception, and she bore a son.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then the women said to Naomi, &#8220;Blessed be the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, who has not left you this day without a redeemer, and may his name be renowned in Israel!
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>He shall be to you a restorer of life and a nourisher of your old age, for your daughter-in-law who loves you, who is more to you than seven sons, has given birth to him.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then Naomi took the child and laid him on her lap and became his nurse.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And the women of the neighborhood gave him a name, saying, &#8220;A son has been born to Naomi.&#8221; They named him Obed. He was the father of Jesse, the father of David.</p>
