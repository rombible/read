<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Azariah the son of Hoshaiah and Johanan the son of Kareah and all the insolent men said to Jeremiah, &#8220;You are telling a lie. The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> our God did not send you to say, &#8216;Do not go to Egypt to live there,&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>but Baruch the son of Neriah has set you against us, to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may kill us or take us into exile in Babylon.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces and all the people did not obey the voice of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, to remain in the land of Judah.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces took all the remnant of Judah who had returned to live in the land of Judah from all the nations to which they had been driven&#8212;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>the men, the women, the children, the princesses, and every person whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan; also Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch the son of Neriah.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And they came into the land of Egypt, for they did not obey the voice of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. And they arrived at Tahpanhes.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes:
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;Take in your hands large stones and hide them in the mortar in the pavement that is at the entrance to Pharaoh&#8217;s palace in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and say to them, &#8216;Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and I will set his throne above these stones that I have hidden, and he will spread his royal canopy over them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>He shall come and strike the land of Egypt, giving over to the pestilence those who are doomed to the pestilence, to captivity those who are doomed to captivity, and to the sword those who are doomed to the sword.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>I shall kindle a fire in the temples of the gods of Egypt, and he shall burn them and carry them away captive. And he shall clean the land of Egypt as a shepherd cleans his cloak of vermin, and he shall go away from there in peace.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>He shall break the obelisks of Heliopolis, which is in the land of Egypt, and the temples of the gods of Egypt he shall burn with fire.&#8217;&#8221;</p></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
