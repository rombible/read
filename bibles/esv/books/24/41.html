As they ate bread together there at Mizpah,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the ten men with him rose up and struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, with the sword, and killed him, whom the king of Babylon had appointed governor in the land.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Ishmael also struck down all the Judeans who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah, and the Chaldean soldiers who happened to be there.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>On the day after the murder of Gedaliah, before anyone knew of it,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>eighty men arrived from Shechem and Shiloh and Samaria, with their beards shaved and their clothes torn, and their bodies gashed, bringing grain offerings and incense to present at the temple of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah came out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he came. As he met them, he said to them, &#8220;Come in to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>When they came into the city, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the men with him slaughtered them and cast them into a cistern.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But there were ten men among them who said to Ishmael, &#8220;Do not put us to death, for we have stores of wheat, barley, oil, and honey hidden in the fields.&#8221; So he refrained and did not put them to death with their companions.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then Ishmael took captive all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah, the king&#8217;s daughters and all the people who were left at Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. Ishmael the son of Nethaniah took them captive and set out to cross over to the Ammonites.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But when Johanan the son of Kareah and all the leaders of the forces with him heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>they took all their men and went to fight against Ishmael the son of Nethaniah. They came upon him at the great pool that is in Gibeon.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah and all the leaders of the forces with him, they rejoiced.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the Ammonites.
