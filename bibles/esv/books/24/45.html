<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/45-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, to you, O Baruch:
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/45-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>You said, &#8216;Woe is me! For the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has added sorrow to my pain. I am weary with my groaning, and I find no rest.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/45-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Thus shall you say to him, Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>: Behold, what I have built I am breaking down, and what I have planted I am plucking up&#8212;that is, the whole land.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/45-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And do you seek great things for yourself? Seek them not, for behold, I am bringing disaster upon all flesh, declares the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. But I will give you your life as a prize of war in all places to which you may go.&#8221;</p></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
