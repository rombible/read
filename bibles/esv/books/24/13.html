<div class="chap"><p class="heading">The Ruined Loincloth</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> to me, &#8220;Go and buy a linen loincloth and put it around your waist, and do not dip it in water.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So I bought a loincloth according to the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and put it around my waist.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> came to me a second time,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8220;Take the loincloth that you have bought, which is around your waist, and arise, go to the Euphrates and hide it there in a cleft of the rock.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So I went and hid it by the Euphrates, as the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> commanded me.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And after many days the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to me, &#8220;Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take from there the loincloth that I commanded you to hide there.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then I went to the Euphrates, and dug, and I took the loincloth from the place where I had hidden it. And behold, the loincloth was spoiled; it was good for nothing.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> came to me:
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>: Even so will I spoil the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>This evil people, who refuse to hear my words, who stubbornly follow their own heart and have gone after other gods to serve them and worship them, shall be like this loincloth, which is good for nothing.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For as the loincloth clings to the waist of a man, so I made the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah cling to me, declares the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, that they might be for me a people, a name, a praise, and a glory, but they would not listen.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then you shall say to them, &#8216;Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>: Behold, I will fill with drunkenness all the inhabitants of this land: the kings who sit on David&#8217;s throne, the priests, the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And I will dash them one against another, fathers and sons together, declares the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.
