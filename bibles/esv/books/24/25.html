<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Seventy Years of Captivity</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah (that was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon),
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem:
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8220;For twenty-three years, from the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, to this day, the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has come to me, and I have spoken persistently to you, but you have not listened.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>You have neither listened nor inclined your ears to hear, although the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> persistently sent to you all his servants the prophets,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>saying, &#8216;Turn now, every one of you, from his evil way and evil deeds, and dwell upon the land that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has given to you and your fathers from of old and forever.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Do not go after other gods to serve and worship them, or provoke me to anger with the work of your hands. Then I will do you no harm.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Yet you have not listened to me, declares the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, that you might provoke me to anger with the work of your hands to your own harm.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8220;Therefore thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts: Because you have not obeyed my words,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>behold, I will send for all the tribes of the north, declares the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and for Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and I will bring them against this land and its inhabitants, and against all these surrounding nations. I will devote them to destruction, and make them a horror, a hissing, and an everlasting desolation.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Moreover, I will banish from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the grinding of the millstones and the light of the lamp.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>This whole land shall become a ruin and a waste, and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then after seventy years are completed, I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation, the land of the Chaldeans, for their iniquity, declares the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, making the land an everlasting waste.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>I will bring upon that land all the words that I have uttered against it, everything written in this book, which Jeremiah prophesied against all the nations.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For many nations and great kings shall make slaves even of them, and I will recompense them according to their deeds and the work of their hands.&#8221;</p>
<p class="heading">The Cup of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s Wrath</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Thus the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, said to me: &#8220;Take from my hand this cup of the wine of wrath, and make all the nations to whom I send you drink it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>They shall drink and stagger and be crazed because of the sword that I am sending among them.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So I took the cup from the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s hand, and made all the nations to whom the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> sent me drink it:
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, its kings and officials, to make them a desolation and a waste, a hissing and a curse, as at this day;
