<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>One basket had very good figs, like first-ripe figs, but the other basket had very bad figs, so bad that they could not be eaten.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to me, &#8220;What do you see, Jeremiah?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Figs, the good figs very good, and the bad figs very bad, so bad that they cannot be eaten.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> came to me:
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8220;Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel: Like these good figs, so I will regard as good the exiles from Judah, whom I have sent away from this place to the land of the Chaldeans.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>I will set my eyes on them for good, and I will bring them back to this land. I will build them up, and not tear them down; I will plant them, and not pluck them up.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>I will give them a heart to know that I am the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and they shall be my people and I will be their God, for they shall return to me with their whole heart.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8220;But thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>: Like the bad figs that are so bad they cannot be eaten, so will I treat Zedekiah the king of Judah, his officials, the remnant of Jerusalem who remain in this land, and those who dwell in the land of Egypt.
