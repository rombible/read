<div class="chap"><p class="heading">The Broken Covenant</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>The word that came to Jeremiah from the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>:
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Hear the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>You shall say to them, Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel: Cursed be the man who does not hear the words of this covenant
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>that I commanded your fathers when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, Listen to my voice, and do all that I command you. So shall you be my people, and I will be your God,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>that I may confirm the oath that I swore to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as at this day.&#8221; Then I answered, &#8220;So be it, <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to me, &#8220;Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem: Hear the words of this covenant and do them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For I solemnly warned your fathers when I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, warning them persistently, even to this day, saying, Obey my voice.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, but everyone walked in the stubbornness of his evil heart. Therefore I brought upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they did not.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Again the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to me, &#8220;A conspiracy exists among the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>They have turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear my words. They have gone after other gods to serve them. The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant that I made with their fathers.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Therefore, thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, Behold, I am bringing disaster upon them that they cannot escape. Though they cry to me, I will not listen to them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and cry to the gods to whom they make offerings, but they cannot save them in the time of their trouble.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For your gods have become as many as your cities, O Judah, and as many as the streets of Jerusalem are the altars you have set up to shame, altars to make offerings to Baal.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>&#8220;Therefore do not pray for this people, or lift up a cry or prayer on their behalf, for I will not listen when they call to me in the time of their trouble.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>What right has my beloved in my house, when she has done many vile deeds? Can even sacrificial flesh avert your doom? Can you then exult?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> once called you &#8216;a green olive tree, beautiful with good fruit.&#8217; But with the roar of a great tempest he will set fire to it, and its branches will be consumed.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts, who planted you, has decreed disaster against you, because of the evil that the house of Israel and the house of Judah have done, provoking me to anger by making offerings to Baal.&#8221;</p>

<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Therefore thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> concerning the men of Anathoth, who seek your life, and say, &#8220;Do not prophesy in the name of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, or you will die by our hand&#8221;&#8212;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>therefore thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts: &#8220;Behold, I will punish them. The young men shall die by the sword, their sons and their daughters shall die by famine,
