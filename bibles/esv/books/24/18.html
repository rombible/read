<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Arise, and go down to the potter&#8217;s house, and there I will let you hear<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or will cause you to hear">a</a></sup></span> my words.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So I went down to the potter&#8217;s house, and there he was working at his wheel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And the vessel he was making of clay was spoiled in the potter&#8217;s hand, and he reworked it into another vessel, as it seemed good to the potter to do.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> came to me:
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>&#8220;O house of Israel, can I not do with you as this potter has done? declares the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. Behold, like the clay in the potter&#8217;s hand, so are you in my hand, O house of Israel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>If at any time I declare concerning a nation or a kingdom, that I will pluck up and break down and destroy it,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>and if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, turns from its evil, I will relent of the disaster that I intended to do to it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And if at any time I declare concerning a nation or a kingdom that I will build and plant it,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and if it does evil in my sight, not listening to my voice, then I will relent of the good that I had intended to do to it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now, therefore, say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: &#8216;Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, Behold, I am shaping disaster against you and devising a plan against you. Return, every one from his evil way, and amend your ways and your deeds.&#8217;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>&#8220;But they say, &#8216;That is in vain! We will follow our own plans, and will every one act according to the stubbornness of his evil heart.&#8217;</p>
