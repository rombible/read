<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Thus the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to me: &#8220;Make yourself straps and yoke-bars, and put them on your neck.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Send word<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew Send them">b</a></sup></span> to the king of Edom, the king of Moab, the king of the sons of Ammon, the king of Tyre, and the king of Sidon by the hand of the envoys who have come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Give them this charge for their masters: &#8216;Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts, the God of Israel: This is what you shall say to your masters:
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8220;It is I who by my great power and my outstretched arm have made the earth, with the men and animals that are on the earth, and I give it to whomever it seems right to me.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, my servant, and I have given him also the beasts of the field to serve him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>All the nations shall serve him and his son and his grandson, until the time of his own land comes. Then many nations and great kings shall make him their slave.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So do not listen to your prophets, your diviners, your dreamers, your fortune-tellers, or your sorcerers, who are saying to you, &#8216;You shall not serve the king of Babylon.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For it is a lie that they are prophesying to you, with the result that you will be removed far from your land, and I will drive you out, and you will perish.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But any nation that will bring its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, I will leave on its own land, to work it and dwell there, declares the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221;&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>To Zedekiah king of Judah I spoke in like manner: &#8220;Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people and live.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Why will you and your people die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence, as the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has spoken concerning any nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Do not listen to the words of the prophets who are saying to you, &#8216;You shall not serve the king of Babylon,&#8217; for it is a lie that they are prophesying to you.

<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, &#8220;Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>: Do not listen to the words of your prophets who are prophesying to you, saying, &#8216;Behold, the vessels of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s house will now shortly be brought back from Babylon,&#8217; for it is a lie that they are prophesying to you.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>For thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts concerning the pillars, the sea, the stands, and the rest of the vessels that are left in this city,
