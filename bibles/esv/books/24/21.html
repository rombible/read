<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Inquire of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> for us, for Nebuchadnezzar<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew Nebuchadrezzar, an alternate spelling of Nebuchadnezzar (king of Babylon) occurring frequently from Jeremiah 21-52; this latter spelling is used throughout Jeremiah for consistency">a</a></sup></span> king of Babylon is making war against us.

<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then Jeremiah said to them: &#8220;Thus you shall say to Zedekiah,

And I will bring them together into the midst of this city.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>I myself will fight against you with outstretched hand and strong arm, in anger and in fury and in great wrath.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And I will strike down the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast. They shall die of a great pestilence.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Afterward, declares the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, I will give Zedekiah king of Judah and his servants and the people in this city who survive the pestilence, sword, and famine into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and into the hand of their enemies, into the hand of those who seek their lives. He shall strike them down with the edge of the sword. He shall not pity them or spare them or have compassion.&#8217;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8220;And to this people you shall say: &#8216;Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>: Behold, I set before you the way of life and the way of death.
