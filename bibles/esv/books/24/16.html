<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Famine, Sword, and Death</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>The word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> came to me:
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;You shall not take a wife, nor shall you have sons or daughters in this place.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> concerning the sons and daughters who are born in this place, and concerning the mothers who bore them and the fathers who fathered them in this land:
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>They shall die of deadly diseases. They shall not be lamented, nor shall they be buried. They shall be as dung on the surface of the ground. They shall perish by the sword and by famine, and their dead bodies shall be food for the birds of the air and for the beasts of the earth.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8220;For thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>: Do not enter the house of mourning, or go to lament or grieve for them, for I have taken away my peace from this people, my steadfast love and mercy, declares the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Both great and small shall die in this land. They shall not be buried, and no one shall lament for them or cut himself or make himself bald for them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>No one shall break bread for the mourner, to comfort him for the dead, nor shall anyone give him the cup of consolation to drink for his father or his mother.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>You shall not go into the house of feasting to sit with them, to eat and drink.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will silence in this place, before your eyes and in your days, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8220;And when you tell this people all these words, and they say to you, &#8216;Why has the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> pronounced all this great evil against us? What is our iniquity? What is the sin that we have committed against the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> our God?&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>then you shall say to them: &#8216;Because your fathers have forsaken me, declares the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and have gone after other gods and have served and worshiped them, and have forsaken me and have not kept my law,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>and because you have done worse than your fathers, for behold, every one of you follows his stubborn, evil will, refusing to listen to me.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Therefore I will hurl you out of this land into a land that neither you nor your fathers have known, and there you shall serve other gods day and night, for I will show you no favor.&#8217;</p>
<p class="heading">The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> Will Restore Israel</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>&#8220;Therefore, behold, the days are coming, declares the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, when it shall no longer be said, &#8216;As the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> lives who brought up the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt,&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>but &#8216;As the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> lives who brought up the people of Israel out of the north country and out of all the countries where he had driven them.&#8217; For I will bring them back to their own land that I gave to their fathers.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>&#8220;Behold, I am sending for many fishers, declares the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and they shall catch them. And afterward I will send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain and every hill, and out of the clefts of the rocks.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>For my eyes are on all their ways. They are not hidden from me, nor is their iniquity concealed from my eyes.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>But first I will doubly repay their iniquity and their sin, because they have polluted my land with the carcasses of their detestable idols, and have filled my inheritance with their abominations.&#8221;</p>
