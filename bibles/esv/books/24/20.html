<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then Pashhur beat Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the upper Benjamin Gate of the house of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>The next day, when Pashhur released Jeremiah from the stocks, Jeremiah said to him, &#8220;The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> does not call your name Pashhur, but Terror on Every Side.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>: Behold, I will make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends. They shall fall by the sword of their enemies while you look on. And I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon. He shall carry them captive to Babylon, and shall strike them down with the sword.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Moreover, I will give all the wealth of the city, all its gains, all its prized belongings, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah into the hand of their enemies, who shall plunder them and seize them and carry them to Babylon.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And you, Pashhur, and all who dwell in your house, shall go into captivity. To Babylon you shall go, and there you shall die, and there you shall be buried, you and all your friends, to whom you have prophesied falsely.&#8221;</p>
