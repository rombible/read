His mother&#8217;s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he did what was evil in the sight of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For because of the anger of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> it came to the point in Jerusalem and Judah that he cast them out from his presence.</p><p class="regular">And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came with all his army against Jerusalem, and laid siege to it.

And they went in the direction of the Arabah.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho, and all his army was scattered from him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then they captured the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he passed sentence on him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>The king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and also slaughtered all the officials of Judah at Riblah.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>He put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him in chains, and the king of Babylon took him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.</p>
