<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And when they heard that he was addressing them in the Hebrew language,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or the Hebrew dialect (probably Aramaic)">a</a></sup></span> they became even more quiet. And he said:</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8220;I am a Jew, born in Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up in this city, educated at the feet of Gamaliel<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or city at the feet of Gamaliel, educated">b</a></sup></span> according to the strict manner of the law of our fathers, being zealous for God as all of you are this day.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering to prison both men and women,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>as the high priest and the whole council of elders can bear me witness. From them I received letters to the brothers, and I journeyed toward Damascus to take those also who were there and bring them in bonds to Jerusalem to be punished.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>&#8220;As I was on my way and drew near to Damascus, about noon a great light from heaven suddenly shone around me.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, <span class="woc">&#8216;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?&#8217;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And I answered, &#8216;Who are you, Lord?&#8217; And he said to me, <span class="woc">&#8216;I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting.&#8217;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Now those who were with me saw the light but did not understand<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or hear with understanding">c</a></sup></span> the voice of the one who was speaking to me.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And I said, &#8216;What shall I do, Lord?&#8217; And the Lord said to me, <span class="woc">&#8216;Rise, and go into Damascus, and there you will be told all that is appointed for you to do.&#8217;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And since I could not see because of the brightness of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me, and came into Damascus.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>&#8220;And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, well spoken of by all the Jews who lived there,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>came to me, and standing by me said to me, &#8216;Brother Saul, receive your sight.&#8217; And at that very hour I received my sight and saw him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And he said, &#8216;The God of our fathers appointed you to know his will, to see the Righteous One and to hear a voice from his mouth;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>for you will be a witness for him to everyone of what you have seen and heard.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And now why do you wait? Rise and be baptized and wash away your sins, calling on his name.&#8217;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>&#8220;When I had returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, I fell into a trance
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>and saw him saying to me, <span class="woc">&#8216;Make haste and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about me.&#8217;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And I said, &#8216;Lord, they themselves know that in one synagogue after another I imprisoned and beat those who believed in you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And when the blood of Stephen your witness was being shed, I myself was standing by and approving and watching over the garments of those who killed him.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And he said to me, <span class="woc">&#8216;Go, for I will send you far away to the Gentiles.&#8217;</span>&#8221;</p>
<p class="heading">Paul and the Roman Tribune</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Up to this word they listened to him. Then they raised their voices and said, &#8220;Away with such a fellow from the earth! For he should not be allowed to live.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And as they were shouting and throwing off their cloaks and flinging dust into the air,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>the tribune ordered him to be brought into the barracks, saying that he should be examined by flogging, to find out why they were shouting against him like this.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>But when they had stretched him out for the whips,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or when they had tied him up with leather strips">d</a></sup></span> Paul said to the centurion who was standing by, &#8220;Is it lawful for you to flog a man who is a Roman citizen and uncondemned?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>When the centurion heard this, he went to the tribune and said to him, &#8220;What are you about to do? For this man is a Roman citizen.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>So the tribune came and said to him, &#8220;Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>The tribune answered, &#8220;I bought this citizenship for a large sum.&#8221; Paul said, &#8220;But I am a citizen by birth.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>So those who were about to examine him withdrew from him immediately, and the tribune also was afraid, for he realized that Paul was a Roman citizen and that he had bound him.</p>
