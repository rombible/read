<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Peter and Cornelius</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>At Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion of what was known as the Italian Cohort,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>a devout man who feared God with all his household, gave alms generously to the people, and prayed continually to God.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>About the ninth hour of the day<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, 3 p.m.">a</a></sup></span> he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God come in and say to him, &#8220;Cornelius.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And he stared at him in terror and said, &#8220;What is it, Lord?&#8221; And he said to him, &#8220;Your prayers and your alms have ascended as a memorial before God.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And now send men to Joppa and bring one Simon who is called Peter.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>He is lodging with one Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>When the angel who spoke to him had departed, he called two of his servants and a devout soldier from among those who attended him,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>and having related everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.</p>
<p class="heading">Peter&#8217;s Vision</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>The next day, as they were on their journey and approaching the city, Peter went up on the housetop about the sixth hour<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, noon">b</a></sup></span> to pray.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And he became hungry and wanted something to eat, but while they were preparing it, he fell into a trance
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>and saw the heavens opened and something like a great sheet descending, being let down by its four corners upon the earth.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>In it were all kinds of animals and reptiles and birds of the air.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And there came a voice to him: <span class="woc">&#8220;Rise, Peter; kill and eat.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But Peter said, &#8220;By no means, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And the voice came to him again a second time, <span class="woc">&#8220;What God has made clean, do not call common.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>This happened three times, and the thing was taken up at once to heaven.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Now while Peter was inwardly perplexed as to what the vision that he had seen might mean, behold, the men who were sent by Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simon&#8217;s house, stood at the gate
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>and called out to ask whether Simon who was called Peter was lodging there.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And while Peter was pondering the vision, the Spirit said to him, &#8220;Behold, three men are looking for you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Rise and go down and accompany them without hesitation,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or accompany them, making no distinction">c</a></sup></span> for I have sent them.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And Peter went down to the men and said, &#8220;I am the one you are looking for. What is the reason for your coming?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And they said, &#8220;Cornelius, a centurion, an upright and God-fearing man, who is well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation, was directed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house and to hear what you have to say.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>So he invited them in to be his guests.</p><p class="regular">The next day he rose and went away with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And on the following day they entered Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>When Peter entered, Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshiped him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>But Peter lifted him up, saying, &#8220;Stand up; I too am a man.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And as he talked with him, he went in and found many persons gathered.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And he said to them, &#8220;You yourselves know how unlawful it is for a Jew to associate with or to visit anyone of another nation, but God has shown me that I should not call any person common or unclean.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>So when I was sent for, I came without objection. I ask then why you sent for me.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And Cornelius said, &#8220;Four days ago, about this hour, I was praying in my house at the ninth hour,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, 3 p.m.">d</a></sup></span> and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>and said, &#8216;Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before God.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Send therefore to Joppa and ask for Simon who is called Peter. He is lodging in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>So I sent for you at once, and you have been kind enough to come. Now therefore we are all here in the presence of God to hear all that you have been commanded by the Lord.&#8221;</p>
<p class="heading">Gentiles Hear the Good News</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>So Peter opened his mouth and said: &#8220;Truly I understand that God shows no partiality,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>As for the word that he sent to Israel, preaching good news of peace through Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all),
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>you yourselves know what happened throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism that John proclaimed:
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power. He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>And we are witnesses of all that he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>but God raised him on the third day and made him to appear,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>not to all the people but to us who had been chosen by God as witnesses, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>And he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one appointed by God to be judge of the living and the dead.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>To him all the prophets bear witness that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.&#8221;</p>
<p class="heading">The Holy Spirit Falls on the Gentiles</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>While Peter was still saying these things, the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard the word.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>And the believers from among the circumcised who had come with Peter were amazed, because the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out even on the Gentiles.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span>For they were hearing them speaking in tongues and extolling God. Then Peter declared,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-47.htm"><b>47</b></a></span>&#8220;Can anyone withhold water for baptizing these people, who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-48.htm"><b>48</b></a></span>And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to remain for some days.</p><A name="footnotes"></a><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">3</span> That is, <span class="us-time">3 p.m.</span><br /><span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">9</span> That is, noon<br /><span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <span class="fnverse">20</span> Or <i><span class="catch-word">accompany them</span>, making no distinction</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">d</span> <span class="fnverse">30</span> That is, <span class="us-time">3 p.m.</span><br /></span></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
