<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Saul Ravages the Church</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>And Saul approved of his execution.</p><p class="regular">And there arose on that day a great persecution against the church in Jerusalem, and they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Devout men buried Stephen and made great lamentation over him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But Saul was ravaging the church, and entering house after house, he dragged off men and women and committed them to prison.</p>
<p class="heading">Philip Proclaims Christ in Samaria</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Now those who were scattered went about preaching the word.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Philip went down to the city<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts a city">a</a></sup></span> of Samaria and proclaimed to them the Christ.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And the crowds with one accord paid attention to what was being said by Philip, when they heard him and saw the signs that he did.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For unclean spirits, crying out with a loud voice, came out of many who had them, and many who were paralyzed or lame were healed.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So there was much joy in that city.</p>
<p class="heading">Simon the Magician Believes</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But there was a man named Simon, who had previously practiced magic in the city and amazed the people of Samaria, saying that he himself was somebody great.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>They all paid attention to him, from the least to the greatest, saying, &#8220;This man is the power of God that is called Great.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And they paid attention to him because for a long time he had amazed them with his magic.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But when they believed Philip as he preached good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Even Simon himself believed, and after being baptized he continued with Philip. And seeing signs and great miracles<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek works of power">b</a></sup></span> performed, he was amazed.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Now when the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>who came down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>for he had not yet fallen on any of them, but they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles&#8217; hands, he offered them money,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>saying, &#8220;Give me this power also, so that anyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>But Peter said to him, &#8220;May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money!
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart is not right before God.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Repent, therefore, of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that, if possible, the intent of your heart may be forgiven you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>For I see that you are in the gall<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, a bitter fluid secreted by the liver; bile">c</a></sup></span> of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And Simon answered, &#8220;Pray for me to the Lord, that nothing of what you have said may come upon me.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Now when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans.</p>
<p class="heading">Philip and the Ethiopian Eunuch</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, &#8220;Rise and go toward the south<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or go at about noon">d</a></sup></span> to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.&#8221; This is a desert place.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And he rose and went. And there was an Ethiopian, a eunuch, a court official of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was in charge of all her treasure. He had come to Jerusalem to worship
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>and was returning, seated in his chariot, and he was reading the prophet Isaiah.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And the Spirit said to Philip, &#8220;Go over and join this chariot.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>So Philip ran to him and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet and asked, &#8220;Do you understand what you are reading?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;How can I, unless someone guides me?&#8221; And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Now the passage of the Scripture that he was reading was this:</p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">&#8220;Like a sheep he was led to the slaughter</span><br /><span class="indent">and like a lamb before its shearer is silent,</span><br /><span class="indent">so he opens not his mouth.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span><span class="ln-group">In his humiliation justice was denied him.</span><br /><span class="indent">Who can describe his generation?</span><br /><span class="ln-group">For his life is taken away from the earth.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="same-paragraph"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>And the eunuch said to Philip, &#8220;About whom, I ask you, does the prophet say this, about himself or about someone else?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning with this Scripture he told him the good news about Jesus.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>And as they were going along the road they came to some water, and the eunuch said, &#8220;See, here is water!

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>And he commanded the chariot to stop, and they both went down into the water, Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord carried Philip away, and the eunuch saw him no more, and went on his way rejoicing.
