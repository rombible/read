<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/2-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>&#8220;Brothers, I may say to you with confidence about the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/2-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants on his throne,

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/2-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says,</p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">&#8220;&#8216;The Lord said to my Lord,</span><br /><span class="ln-group">&#8220;Sit at my right hand,</span><br />

<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/2-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>Now when they heard this they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, &#8220;Brothers, what shall we do?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/2-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>And Peter said to them, &#8220;Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
