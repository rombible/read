<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Paul and Silas in Thessalonica</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Paul went in, as was his custom, and on three Sabbath days he reasoned with them from the Scriptures,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>explaining and proving that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead, and saying, &#8220;This Jesus, whom I proclaim to you, is the Christ.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And some of them were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, as did a great many of the devout Greeks and not a few of the leading women.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But the Jews<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek Ioudaioi probably refers here to Jewish religious leaders, and others under their influence, in that time; also verse 13">a</a></sup></span> were jealous, and taking some wicked men of the rabble, they formed a mob, set the city in an uproar, and attacked the house of Jason, seeking to bring them out to the crowd.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And when they could not find them, they dragged Jason and some of the brothers before the city authorities, shouting, &#8220;These men who have turned the world upside down have come here also,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and Jason has received them, and they are all acting against the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And the people and the city authorities were disturbed when they heard these things.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And when they had taken money as security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.</p>
<p class="heading">Paul and Silas in Berea</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>The brothers<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or brothers and sisters; also verse 14">b</a></sup></span> immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea, and when they arrived they went into the Jewish synagogue.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now these Jews were more noble than those in Thessalonica; they received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Many of them therefore believed, with not a few Greek women of high standing as well as men.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>But when the Jews from Thessalonica learned that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul at Berea also, they came there too, agitating and stirring up the crowds.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then the brothers immediately sent Paul off on his way to the sea, but Silas and Timothy remained there.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Those who conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens, and after receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible, they departed.</p>
<p class="heading">Paul in Athens</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he saw that the city was full of idols.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons, and in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be there.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also conversed with him. And some said, &#8220;What does this babbler wish to say?&#8221; Others said, &#8220;He seems to be a preacher of foreign divinities&#8221;&#8212;because he was preaching Jesus and the resurrection.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And they took him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, &#8220;May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>For you bring some strange things to our ears. We wish to know therefore what these things mean.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Now all the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there would spend their time in nothing except telling or hearing something new.</p>
<p class="heading">Paul Addresses the Areopagus</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So Paul, standing in the midst of the Areopagus, said: &#8220;Men of Athens, I perceive that in every way you are very religious.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>For as I passed along and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription: &#8216;To the unknown god.&#8217; What therefore you worship as unknown, this I proclaim to you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>The God who made the world and everything in it, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in temples made by man,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek made by hands">c</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all mankind life and breath and everything.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And he made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their dwelling place,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>that they should seek God, and perhaps feel their way toward him and find him. Yet he is actually not far from each one of us,

<p class="same-paragraph"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Being then God&#8217;s offspring, we ought not to think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by the art and imagination of man.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed; and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked. But others said, &#8220;We will hear you again about this.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>So Paul went out from their midst.
