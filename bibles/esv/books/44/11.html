<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Peter Reports to the Church</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Now the apostles and the brothers<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or brothers and sisters">a</a></sup></span> who were throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcision party<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or Jerusalem, those of the circumcision">b</a></sup></span> criticized him, saying,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8220;You went to uncircumcised men and ate with them.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But Peter began and explained it to them in order:
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8220;I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision, something like a great sheet descending, being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came down to me.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Looking at it closely, I observed animals and beasts of prey and reptiles and birds of the air.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And I heard a voice saying to me, <span class="woc">&#8216;Rise, Peter; kill and eat.&#8217;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But I said, &#8216;By no means, Lord; for nothing common or unclean has ever entered my mouth.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But the voice answered a second time from heaven, <span class="woc">&#8216;What God has made clean, do not call common.&#8217;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>This happened three times, and all was drawn up again into heaven.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And behold, at that very moment three men arrived at the house in which we were, sent to me from Caesarea.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And the Spirit told me to go with them, making no distinction. These six brothers also accompanied me, and we entered the man&#8217;s house.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And he told us how he had seen the angel stand in his house and say, &#8216;Send to Joppa and bring Simon who is called Peter;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>he will declare to you a message by which you will be saved, you and all your household.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them just as on us at the beginning.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, <span class="woc">&#8216;John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.&#8217;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>If then God gave the same gift to them as he gave to us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could stand in God&#8217;s way?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>When they heard these things they fell silent. And they glorified God, saying, &#8220;Then to the Gentiles also God has granted repentance that leads to life.&#8221;</p>
<p class="heading">The Church in Antioch</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Now those who were scattered because of the persecution that arose over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except Jews.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who on coming to Antioch spoke to the Hellenists<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or Greeks (that is, Greek-speaking non-Jews)">c</a></sup></span> also, preaching the Lord Jesus.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number who believed turned to the Lord.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>The report of this came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>When he came and saw the grace of God, he was glad, and he exhorted them all to remain faithful to the Lord with steadfast purpose,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>for he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a great many people were added to the Lord.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>So Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. For a whole year they met with the church and taught a great many people. And in Antioch the disciples were first called Christians.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Now in these days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And one of them named Agabus stood up and foretold by the Spirit that there would be a great famine over all the world (this took place in the days of Claudius).
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>So the disciples determined, every one according to his ability, to send relief to the brothers<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or brothers and sisters">d</a></sup></span> living in Judea.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And they did so, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.</p><A name="footnotes"></a><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">1</span> Or <i><span class="catch-word">brothers</span> and sisters</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">2</span> Or <i><span class="catch-word">Jerusalem,</span> those of the circumcision</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <span class="fnverse">20</span> Or <i>Greeks</i> (that is, Greek-speaking non-Jews)<br /><span class="footnotesbot">d</span> <span class="fnverse">29</span> Or <i><span class="catch-word">brothers</span> and sisters</i><br /></span></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
