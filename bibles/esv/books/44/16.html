<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Timothy Joins Paul and Silas</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Paul<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek He">a</a></sup></span> came also to Derbe and to Lystra. A disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer, but his father was a Greek.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>He was well spoken of by the brothers<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or brothers and sisters; also verse 40">b</a></sup></span> at Lystra and Iconium.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Paul wanted Timothy to accompany him, and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those places, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>As they went on their way through the cities, they delivered to them for observance the decisions that had been reached by the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So the churches were strengthened in the faith, and they increased in numbers daily.</p>
<p class="heading">The Macedonian Call</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And when they had come up to Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So, passing by Mysia, they went down to Troas.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: a man of Macedonia was standing there, urging him and saying, &#8220;Come over to Macedonia and help us.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And when Paul<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek he">c</a></sup></span> had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go on into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.</p>
<p class="heading">The Conversion of Lydia</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So, setting sail from Troas, we made a direct voyage to Samothrace, and the following day to Neapolis,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>and from there to Philippi, which is a leading city of the<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or that">d</a></sup></span> district of Macedonia and a Roman colony. We remained in this city some days.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And on the Sabbath day we went outside the gate to the riverside, where we supposed there was a place of prayer, and we sat down and spoke to the women who had come together.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>One who heard us was a woman named Lydia, from the city of Thyatira, a seller of purple goods, who was a worshiper of God. The Lord opened her heart to pay attention to what was said by Paul.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And after she was baptized, and her household as well, she urged us, saying, &#8220;If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come to my house and stay.&#8221; And she prevailed upon us.</p>
<p class="heading">Paul and Silas in Prison</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>As we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a slave girl who had a spirit of divination and brought her owners much gain by fortune-telling.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>She followed Paul and us, crying out, &#8220;These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to you the way of salvation.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And this she kept doing for many days. Paul, having become greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, &#8220;I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.&#8221; And it came out that very hour.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>But when her owners saw that their hope of gain was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And when they had brought them to the magistrates, they said, &#8220;These men are Jews, and they are disturbing our city.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>They advocate customs that are not lawful for us as Romans to accept or practice.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>The crowd joined in attacking them, and the magistrates tore the garments off them and gave orders to beat them with rods.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And when they had inflicted many blows upon them, they threw them into prison, ordering the jailer to keep them safely.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Having received this order, he put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.</p>
<p class="heading">The Philippian Jailer Converted</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>and suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken. And immediately all the doors were opened, and everyone&#8217;s bonds were unfastened.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>When the jailer woke and saw that the prison doors were open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>But Paul cried with a loud voice, &#8220;Do not harm yourself, for we are all here.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And the jailer<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek he">e</a></sup></span> called for lights and rushed in, and trembling with fear he fell down before Paul and Silas.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Then he brought them out and said, &#8220;Sirs, what must I do to be saved?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>And they said, &#8220;Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And he took them the same hour of the night and washed their wounds; and he was baptized at once, he and all his family.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Then he brought them up into his house and set food before them. And he rejoiced along with his entire household that he had believed in God.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>But when it was day, the magistrates sent the police, saying, &#8220;Let those men go.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>And the jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, &#8220;The magistrates have sent to let you go. Therefore come out now and go in peace.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>But Paul said to them, &#8220;They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men who are Roman citizens, and have thrown us into prison; and do they now throw us out secretly? No! Let them come themselves and take us out.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>The police reported these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Roman citizens.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>So they came and apologized to them. And they took them out and asked them to leave the city.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>So they went out of the prison and visited Lydia. And when they had seen the brothers, they encouraged them and departed.</p><A name="footnotes"></a><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">1</span> Greek <i>He</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">2</span> Or <i><span class="catch-word">brothers</span> and sisters</i>; also verse 40<br /><span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <span class="fnverse">10</span> Greek <i>he</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">d</span> <span class="fnverse">12</span> Or <i>that</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">e</span> <span class="fnverse">29</span> Greek <i>he</i><br /></span></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
