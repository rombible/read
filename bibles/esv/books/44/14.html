<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Paul and Barnabas at Iconium</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/14-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Now at Iconium they entered together into the Jewish synagogue and spoke in such a way that a great number of both Jews and Greeks believed.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/14-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or brothers and sisters">a</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/14-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So they remained for a long time, speaking boldly for the Lord, who bore witness to the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/14-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But the people of the city were divided; some sided with the Jews and some with the apostles.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/14-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>When an attempt was made by both Gentiles and Jews, with their rulers, to mistreat them and to stone them,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/14-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>they learned of it and fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and to the surrounding country,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/14-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and there they continued to preach the gospel.</p>
<p class="heading">Paul and Barnabas at Lystra</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/14-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Now at Lystra there was a man sitting who could not use his feet. He was crippled from birth and had never walked.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/14-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>He listened to Paul speaking. And Paul, looking intently at him and seeing that he had faith to be made well,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or be saved">b</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/14-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>said in a loud voice, &#8220;Stand upright on your feet.&#8221; And he sprang up and began walking.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/14-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And when the crowds saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in Lycaonian, &#8220;The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/14-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul, Hermes, because he was the chief speaker.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/14-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And the priest of Zeus, whose temple was at the entrance to the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates and wanted to offer sacrifice with the crowds.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/14-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their garments and rushed out into the crowd, crying out,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/14-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>&#8220;Men, why are you doing these things? We also are men, of like nature with you, and we bring you good news, that you should turn from these vain things to a living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/14-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>In past generations he allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/14-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Yet he did not leave himself without witness, for he did good by giving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/14-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Even with these words they scarcely restrained the people from offering sacrifice to them.</p>
<p class="heading">Paul Stoned at Lystra</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/14-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>But Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and having persuaded the crowds, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/14-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>But when the disciples gathered about him, he rose up and entered the city, and on the next day he went on with Barnabas to Derbe.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/14-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>When they had preached the gospel to that city and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/14-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the faith, and saying that through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/14-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And when they had appointed elders for them in every church, with prayer and fasting they committed them to the Lord in whom they had believed.</p>
<p class="heading">Paul and Barnabas Return to Antioch in Syria</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/14-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then they passed through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/14-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/14-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>and from there they sailed to Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work that they had fulfilled.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/14-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And when they arrived and gathered the church together, they declared all that God had done with them, and how he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/14-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And they remained no little time with the disciples.</p><A name="footnotes"></a><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">2</span> Or <i><span class="catch-word">brothers</span> and sisters</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">9</span> Or <i>be saved</i><br /></span></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
