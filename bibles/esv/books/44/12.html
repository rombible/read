<div class="chap"><p class="heading">James Killed and Peter Imprisoned</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>About that time Herod the king laid violent hands on some who belonged to the church.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>He killed James the brother of John with the sword,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and when he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. This was during the days of Unleavened Bread.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And when he had seized him, he put him in prison, delivering him over to four squads of soldiers to guard him, intending after the Passover to bring him out to the people.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So Peter was kept in prison, but earnest prayer for him was made to God by the church.</p>
<p class="heading">Peter Is Rescued</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now when Herod was about to bring him out, on that very night, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and sentries before the door were guarding the prison.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And behold, an angel of the Lord stood next to him, and a light shone in the cell. He struck Peter on the side and woke him, saying, &#8220;Get up quickly.&#8221; And the chains fell off his hands.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And the angel said to him, &#8220;Dress yourself and put on your sandals.&#8221; And he did so. And he said to him, &#8220;Wrap your cloak around you and follow me.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And he went out and followed him. He did not know that what was being done by the angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>When they had passed the first and the second guard, they came to the iron gate leading into the city. It opened for them of its own accord, and they went out and went along one street, and immediately the angel left him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>When Peter came to himself, he said, &#8220;Now I am sure that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>When he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John whose other name was Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And when he knocked at the door of the gateway, a servant girl named Rhoda came to answer.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Recognizing Peter&#8217;s voice, in her joy she did not open the gate but ran in and reported that Peter was standing at the gate.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>They said to her, &#8220;You are out of your mind.&#8221; But she kept insisting that it was so, and they kept saying, &#8220;It is his angel!&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But Peter continued knocking, and when they opened, they saw him and were amazed.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he described to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, &#8220;Tell these things to James and to the brothers.&#8221;<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or brothers and sisters">a</a></sup></span> Then he departed and went to another place.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Now when day came, there was no little disturbance among the soldiers over what had become of Peter.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And after Herod searched for him and did not find him, he examined the sentries and ordered that they should be put to death. Then he went down from Judea to Caesarea and spent time there.</p>
<p class="heading">The Death of Herod</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Now Herod was angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon, and they came to him with one accord, and having persuaded Blastus, the king&#8217;s chamberlain,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, trusted personal attendant">b</a></sup></span> they asked for peace, because their country depended on the king&#8217;s country for food.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>On an appointed day Herod put on his royal robes, took his seat upon the throne, and delivered an oration to them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And the people were shouting, &#8220;The voice of a god, and not of a man!&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Immediately an angel of the Lord struck him down, because he did not give God the glory, and he was eaten by worms and breathed his last.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>But the word of God increased and multiplied.</p>
