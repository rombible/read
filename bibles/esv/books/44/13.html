<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Barnabas and Saul Sent Off</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Now there were in the church at Antioch prophets and teachers, Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Niger is a Latin word meaning black, or dark">a</a></sup></span> Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen a lifelong friend of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, &#8220;Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then after fasting and praying they laid their hands on them and sent them off.</p>
<p class="heading">Barnabas and Saul on Cyprus</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia, and from there they sailed to Cyprus.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>When they arrived at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. And they had John to assist them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, they came upon a certain magician, a Jewish false prophet named Bar-Jesus.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>He was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of intelligence, who summoned Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But Elymas the magician (for that is the meaning of his name) opposed them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But Saul, who was also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently at him
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and said, &#8220;You son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, full of all deceit and villainy, will you not stop making crooked the straight paths of the Lord?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you will be blind and unable to see the sun for a time.&#8221; Immediately mist and darkness fell upon him, and he went about seeking people to lead him by the hand.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then the proconsul believed, when he saw what had occurred, for he was astonished at the teaching of the Lord.</p>
<p class="heading">Paul and Barnabas at Antioch in Pisidia</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Now Paul and his companions set sail from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia. And John left them and returned to Jerusalem,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>but they went on from Perga and came to Antioch in Pisidia. And on the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>After the reading from the Law and the Prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent a message to them, saying, &#8220;Brothers, if you have any word of encouragement for the people, say it.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand said:</p><p class="regular">&#8220;Men of Israel and you who fear God, listen.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with uplifted arm he led them out of it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And for about forty years he put up with<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts he carried (compare Deuteronomy 1:31)">b</a></sup></span> them in the wilderness.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And after destroying seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land as an inheritance.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>All this took about 450 years. And after that he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And when he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king, of whom he testified and said, &#8216;I have found in David the son of Jesse a man after my heart, who will do all my will.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Of this man&#8217;s offspring God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus, as he promised.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Before his coming, John had proclaimed a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And as John was finishing his course, he said, &#8216;What do you suppose that I am? I am not he. No, but behold, after me one is coming, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.&#8217;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>&#8220;Brothers, sons of the family of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, to us has been sent the message of this salvation.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>For those who live in Jerusalem and their rulers, because they did not recognize him nor understand the utterances of the prophets, which are read every Sabbath, fulfilled them by condemning him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And though they found in him no guilt worthy of death, they asked Pilate to have him executed.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And when they had carried out all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>But God raised him from the dead,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>and for many days he appeared to those who had come up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses to the people.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And we bring you the good news that what God promised to the fathers,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>this he has fulfilled to us their children by raising Jesus, as also it is written in the second Psalm,</p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">&#8220;&#8216;You are my Son,</span><br /><span class="indent">today I have begotten you.&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="same-paragraph"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>And as for the fact that he raised him from the dead, no more to return to corruption, he has spoken in this way,</p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">&#8220;&#8216;I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David.&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="same-paragraph"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Therefore he says also in another psalm,</p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">&#8220;&#8216;You will not let your Holy One see corruption.&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="same-paragraph"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>For David, after he had served the purpose of God in his own generation, fell asleep and was laid with his fathers and saw corruption,

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>Let it be known to you therefore, brothers, that through this man forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you,

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>Beware, therefore, lest what is said in the Prophets should come about:</p>

<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>As they went out, the people begged that these things might be told them the next Sabbath.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>And after the meeting of the synagogue broke up, many Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who, as they spoke with them, urged them to continue in the grace of God.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>The next Sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span>And Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, saying, &#8220;It was necessary that the word of God be spoken first to you.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-47.htm"><b>47</b></a></span>For so the Lord has commanded us, saying,</p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">&#8220;&#8216;I have made you a light for the Gentiles,</span><br /><span class="indent">that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.&#8217;&#8221;</span></p>
