<p class="heading">The Ascension</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So when they had come together, they asked him, &#8220;Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>He said to them, <span class="woc">&#8220;It is not for you to know times or seasons that the Father has fixed by his own authority.</span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And when he had said these things, as they were looking on, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And while they were gazing into heaven as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white robes,
