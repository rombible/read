<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>though I myself have reason for confidence in the flesh also. If anyone else thinks he has reason for confidence in the flesh, I have more:

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith&#8212;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>that I may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>that by any means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Brothers, I do not consider that I have made it my own. But one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.
