<p class="heading">Thanksgiving and Prayer</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>I thank my God in all my remembrance of you,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>always in every prayer of mine for you all making my prayer with joy,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>It is right for me to feel this way about you all, because I hold you in my heart, for you are all partakers with me of grace,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or you all have fellowship with me in grace">d</a></sup></span> both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For God is my witness, how I yearn for you all with the affection of Christ Jesus.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And it is my prayer that your love may abound more and more, with knowledge and all discernment,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>so that you may approve what is excellent, and so be pure and blameless for the day of Christ,

<p class="heading">The Advance of the Gospel</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>I want you to know, brothers,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or brothers and sisters. In New Testament usage, depending on the context, the plural Greek word adelphoi (translated brothers) may refer either to brothers or to brothers and sisters; also verse 14">e</a></sup></span> that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>so that it has become known throughout the whole imperial guard<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek in the whole praetorium">f</a></sup></span> and to all the rest that my imprisonment is for Christ.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And most of the brothers, having become confident in the Lord by my imprisonment, are much more bold to speak the word<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts add of God">g</a></sup></span> without fear.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Some indeed preach Christ from envy and rivalry, but others from good will.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>The latter do it out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>The former proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely but thinking to afflict me in my imprisonment.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and in that I rejoice.</p><p class="heading">To Live Is Christ</p><p class="regular">                  Yes, and I will rejoice,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>for I know that through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>as it is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be at all ashamed, but that with full courage now as always Christ will be honored in my body, whether by life or by death.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me. Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith,

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>and not frightened in anything by your opponents. This is a clear sign to them of their destruction, but of your salvation, and that from God.
