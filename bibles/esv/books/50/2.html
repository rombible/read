<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or which was also in Christ Jesus">a</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or a thing to be held on to for advantage">b</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or slave (for the contextual rendering of the Greek word doulos, see Preface)">c</a></sup></span> being born in the likeness of men.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</p>
<p class="heading">Lights in the World</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, so now, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Do all things without grumbling or disputing,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>that you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>holding fast to the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I may be proud that I did not run in vain or labor in vain.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Even if I am to be poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrificial offering of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Likewise you also should be glad and rejoice with me.</p>
<p class="heading">Timothy and Epaphroditus</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, so that I too may be cheered by news of you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>For I have no one like him, who will be genuinely concerned for your welfare.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>For they all seek their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But you know Timothy&#8217;s<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek his">d</a></sup></span> proven worth, how as a son<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek child">e</a></sup></span> with a father he has served with me in the gospel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>I hope therefore to send him just as soon as I see how it will go with me,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>and I trust in the Lord that shortly I myself will come also.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>I have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, and your messenger and minister to my need,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>for he has been longing for you all and has been distressed because you heard that he was ill.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Indeed he was ill, near to death. But God had mercy on him, and not only on him but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>I am the more eager to send him, therefore, that you may rejoice at seeing him again, and that I may be less anxious.
