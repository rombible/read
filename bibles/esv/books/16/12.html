<p class="heading">Dedication of the Wall</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites in all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem to celebrate the dedication with gladness, with thanksgivings and with singing, with cymbals, harps, and lyres.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And the sons of the singers gathered together from the district surrounding Jerusalem and from the villages of the Netophathites;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>also from Beth-gilgal and from the region of Geba and Azmaveth, for the singers had built for themselves villages around Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and they purified the people and the gates and the wall.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Then I brought the leaders of Judah up onto the wall and appointed two great choirs that gave thanks. One went to the south on the wall to the Dung Gate.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And after them went Hoshaiah and half of the leaders of Judah,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>and Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>and certain of the priests&#8217; sons with trumpets: Zechariah the son of Jonathan, son of Shemaiah, son of Mattaniah, son of Micaiah, son of Zaccur, son of Asaph;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>and his relatives, Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God. And Ezra the scribe went before them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>At the Fountain Gate they went up straight before them by the stairs of the city of David, at the ascent of the wall, above the house of David, to the Water Gate on the east.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>The other choir of those who gave thanks went to the north, and I followed them with half of the people, on the wall, above the Tower of the Ovens, to the Broad Wall,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>and above the Gate of Ephraim, and by the Gate of Yeshanah,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or of the old city">a</a></sup></span> and by the Fish Gate and the Tower of Hananel and the Tower of the Hundred, to the Sheep Gate; and they came to a halt at the Gate of the Guard.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>So both choirs of those who gave thanks stood in the house of God, and I and half of the officials with me;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>and the priests Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>and Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang with Jezrahiah as their leader.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>And they offered great sacrifices that day and rejoiced, for God had made them rejoice with great joy; the women and children also rejoiced. And the joy of Jerusalem was heard far away.</p>
<p class="heading">Service at the Temple</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>On that day men were appointed over the storerooms, the contributions, the firstfruits, and the tithes, to gather into them the portions required by the Law for the priests and for the Levites according to the fields of the towns, for Judah rejoiced over the priests and the Levites who ministered.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>And they performed the service of their God and the service of purification, as did the singers and the gatekeepers, according to the command of David and his son Solomon.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span>For long ago in the days of David and Asaph there were directors of the singers, and there were songs<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or leaders">b</a></sup></span> of praise and thanksgiving to God.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-47.htm"><b>47</b></a></span>And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah gave the daily portions for the singers and the gatekeepers; and they set apart that which was for the Levites; and the Levites set apart that which was for the sons of Aaron.</p><A name="footnotes"></a><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">39</span> Or <i><span class="catch-word">of</span> the old city</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">46</span> Or <i>leaders</i><br /></span></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
