<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he said in the presence of his brothers and of the army of Samaria, &#8220;What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they restore it for themselves?<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or Will they commit themselves to God?">b</a></sup></span> Will they sacrifice? Will they finish up in a day? Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish, and burned ones at that?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Tobiah the Ammonite was beside him, and he said, &#8220;Yes, what they are building&#8212;if a fox goes up on it he will break down their stone wall!&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Hear, O our God, for we are despised. Turn back their taunt on their own heads and give them up to be plundered in a land where they are captives.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Do not cover their guilt, and let not their sin be blotted out from your sight, for they have provoked you to anger in the presence of the builders.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So we built the wall. And all the wall was joined together to half its height, for the people had a mind to work.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span><span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Ch 4:1 in Hebrew">c</a></sup></span> But when Sanballat and Tobiah and the Arabs and the Ammonites and the Ashdodites heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem was going forward and that the breaches were beginning to be closed, they were very angry.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And they all plotted together to come and fight against Jerusalem and to cause confusion in it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And we prayed to our God and set a guard as a protection against them day and night.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>In Judah it was said,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew Judah said">d</a></sup></span> &#8220;The strength of those who bear the burdens is failing. There is too much rubble. By ourselves we will not be able to rebuild the wall.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And our enemies said, &#8220;They will not know or see till we come among them and kill them and stop the work.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>At that time the Jews who lived near them came from all directions and said to us ten times, &#8220;You must return to us.&#8221;<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain">e</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, in open places, I stationed the people by their clans, with their swords, their spears, and their bows.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And I looked and arose and said to the nobles and to the officials and to the rest of the people, &#8220;Do not be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your homes.&#8221;</p>
<p class="heading">The Work Resumes</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>When our enemies heard that it was known to us and that God had frustrated their plan, we all returned to the wall, each to his work.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>From that day on, half of my servants worked on construction, and half held the spears, shields, bows, and coats of mail. And the leaders stood behind the whole house of Judah,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>who were building on the wall. Those who carried burdens were loaded in such a way that each labored on the work with one hand and held his weapon with the other.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And each of the builders had his sword strapped at his side while he built. The man who sounded the trumpet was beside me.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And I said to the nobles and to the officials and to the rest of the people, &#8220;The work is great and widely spread, and we are separated on the wall, far from one another.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>In the place where you hear the sound of the trumpet, rally to us there. Our God will fight for us.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>So we labored at the work, and half of them held the spears from the break of dawn until the stars came out.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>I also said to the people at that time, &#8220;Let every man and his servant pass the night within Jerusalem, that they may be a guard for us by night and may labor by day.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>So neither I nor my brothers nor my servants nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us took off our clothes; each kept his weapon at his right hand.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or his weapon when drinking">f</a></sup></span></p><A name="footnotes"></a><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">1</span> Ch 3:33 in Hebrew<br /><span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">2</span> Or <i><span class="catch-word">Will they</span> commit themselves to God?</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <span class="fnverse">7</span> Ch 4:1 in Hebrew<br /><span class="footnotesbot">d</span> <span class="fnverse">10</span> Hebrew <i>Judah said</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">e</span> <span class="fnverse">12</span> The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain<br /><span class="footnotesbot">f</span> <span class="fnverse">23</span> Or <i>his weapon when drinking</i><br /></span></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
