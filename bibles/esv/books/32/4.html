<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he prayed to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and said, &#8220;O <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, is not this what I said when I was yet in my country? That is why I made haste to flee to Tarshish; for I knew that you are a gracious God and merciful, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love, and relenting from disaster.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Therefore now, O <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, please take my life from me, for it is better for me to die than to live.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said, &#8220;Do you do well to be angry?&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Jonah went out of the city and sat to the east of the city and made a booth for himself there. He sat under it in the shade, till he should see what would become of the city.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> God appointed a plant<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew qiqayon, probably the castor oil plant; also verses 7, 9, 10">b</a></sup></span> and made it come up over Jonah, that it might be a shade over his head, to save him from his discomfort.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or his evil">c</a></sup></span> So Jonah was exceedingly glad because of the plant.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But when dawn came up the next day, God appointed a worm that attacked the plant, so that it withered.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>When the sun rose, God appointed a scorching east wind, and the sun beat down on the head of Jonah so that he was faint. And he asked that he might die and said, &#8220;It is better for me to die than to live.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But God said to Jonah, &#8220;Do you do well to be angry for the plant?&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Yes, I do well to be angry, angry enough to die.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said, &#8220;You pity the plant, for which you did not labor, nor did you make it grow, which came into being in a night and perished in a night.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And should not I pity Nineveh, that great city, in which there are more than 120,000 persons who do not know their right hand from their left, and also much cattle?&#8221;</p><A name="footnotes"></a><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">1</span> Hebrew <i><span class="catch-word">it</span> was exceedingly evil to Jonah</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">6</span> Hebrew <i language="Hebrew">qiqayon</i>, probably the castor oil plant; also verses 7, 9, 10<br /><span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <span class="fnverse">6</span> Or <i><span class="catch-word">his</span> evil</i><br /></span></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
