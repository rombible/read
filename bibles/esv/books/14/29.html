His mother&#8217;s name was Abijah<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Spelled Abi in 2 Kings 18:2">a</a></sup></span> the daughter of Zechariah.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he did what was right in the eyes of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, according to all that David his father had done.</p>
<p class="heading">Hezekiah Cleanses the Temple</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>In the first year of his reign, in the first month, he opened the doors of the house of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and repaired them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>He brought in the priests and the Levites and assembled them in the square on the east

Now consecrate yourselves, and consecrate the house of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of your fathers, and carry out the filth<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew impurity">b</a></sup></span> from the Holy Place.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>For our fathers have been unfaithful and have done what was evil in the sight of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> our God. They have forsaken him and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and turned their backs.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>They also shut the doors of the vestibule and put out the lamps and have not burned incense or offered burnt offerings in the Holy Place to the God of Israel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Therefore the wrath of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> came on Judah and Jerusalem, and he has made them an object of horror, of astonishment, and of hissing, as you see with your own eyes.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For behold, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, in order that his fierce anger may turn away from us.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>My sons, do not now be negligent, for the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has chosen you to stand in his presence, to minister to him and to be his ministers and make offerings to him.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites; and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehallelel; and of the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah;

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>They gathered their brothers and consecrated themselves and went in as the king had commanded, by the words of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, to cleanse the house of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>The priests went into the inner part of the house of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> to cleanse it, and they brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> into the court of the house of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then they went in to Hezekiah the king and said, &#8220;We have cleansed all the house of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and the table for the showbread and all its utensils.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>All the utensils that King Ahaz discarded in his reign when he was faithless, we have made ready and consecrated, and behold, they are before the altar of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221;</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So they slaughtered the bulls, and the priests received the blood and threw it against the altar.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Then the goats for the sin offering were brought to the king and the assembly, and they laid their hands on them,

<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And he stationed the Levites in the house of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> with cymbals, harps, and lyres, according to the commandment of David and of Gad the king&#8217;s seer and of Nathan the prophet, for the commandment was from the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> through his prophets.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>The Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>The whole assembly worshiped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded. All this continued until the burnt offering was finished.

<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Then Hezekiah said, &#8220;You have now consecrated yourselves to<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew filled your hand for">c</a></sup></span> the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. Come near; bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the house of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221; And the assembly brought sacrifices and thank offerings, and all who were of a willing heart brought burnt offerings.
