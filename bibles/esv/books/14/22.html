So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Ahaziah was twenty-two<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="See 2 Kings 8:26; Hebrew forty-two; Septuagint twenty">a</a></sup></span> years old when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother&#8217;s name was Athaliah, the granddaughter of Omri.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother was his counselor in doing wickedly.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>He did what was evil in the sight of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, as the house of Ahab had done. For after the death of his father they were his counselors, to his undoing.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>He even followed their counsel and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to make war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead. And the Syrians wounded Joram,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and he returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds that he had received at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was wounded.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But it was ordained by<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew was from">b</a></sup></span> God that the downfall of Ahaziah should come about through his going to visit Joram. For when he came there, he went out with Jehoram to meet Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> had anointed to destroy the house of Ahab.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And when Jehu was executing judgment on the house of Ahab, he met the princes of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah&#8217;s brothers, who attended Ahaziah, and he killed them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>He searched for Ahaziah, and he was captured while hiding in Samaria, and he was brought to Jehu and put to death. They buried him, for they said, &#8220;He is the grandson of Jehoshaphat, who sought the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> with all his heart.&#8221; And the house of Ahaziah had no one able to rule the kingdom.</p>
