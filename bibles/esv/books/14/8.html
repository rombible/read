<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Solomon rebuilt the cities that Hiram had given to him, and settled the people of Israel in them.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And Solomon went to Hamath-zobah and took it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>He built Tadmor in the wilderness and all the store cities that he built in Hamath.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>He also built Upper Beth-horon and Lower Beth-horon, fortified cities with walls, gates, and bars,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and Baalath, and all the store cities that Solomon had and all the cities for his chariots and the cities for his horsemen, and whatever Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>All the people who were left of the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of Israel,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>from their descendants who were left after them in the land, whom the people of Israel had not destroyed&#8212;these Solomon drafted as forced labor, and so they are to this day.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But of the people of Israel Solomon made no slaves for his work; they were soldiers, and his officers, the commanders of his chariots, and his horsemen.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And these were the chief officers of King Solomon, 250, who exercised authority over the people.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Solomon brought Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter up from the city of David to the house that he had built for her, for he said, &#8220;My wife shall not live in the house of David king of Israel, for the places to which the ark of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has come are holy.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then Solomon offered up burnt offerings to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> on the altar of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> that he had built before the vestibule,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>as the duty of each day required, offering according to the commandment of Moses for the Sabbaths, the new moons, and the three annual feasts&#8212;the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Booths.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>According to the ruling of David his father, he appointed the divisions of the priests for their service, and the Levites for their offices of praise and ministry before the priests as the duty of each day required, and the gatekeepers in their divisions at each gate, for so David the man of God had commanded.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And they did not turn aside from what the king had commanded the priests and Levites concerning any matter and concerning the treasuries.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Thus was accomplished all the work of Solomon from<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Septuagint, Syriac, Vulgate; Hebrew to">a</a></sup></span> the day the foundation of the house of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> was laid until it was finished.
