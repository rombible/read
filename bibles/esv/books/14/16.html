<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then Asa took silver and gold from the treasures of the house of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and the king&#8217;s house and sent them to Ben-hadad king of Syria, who lived in Damascus, saying,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8220;There is a covenant<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or treaty; twice in this verse">a</a></sup></span> between me and you, as there was between my father and your father. Behold, I am sending to you silver and gold. Go, break your covenant with Baasha king of Israel, that he may withdraw from me.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And Ben-hadad listened to King Asa and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel, and they conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel-maim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And when Baasha heard of it, he stopped building Ramah and let his work cease.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then King Asa took all Judah, and they carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber, with which Baasha had been building, and with them he built Geba and Mizpah.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah and said to him, &#8220;Because you relied on the king of Syria, and did not rely on the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God, the army of the king of Syria has escaped you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Were not the Ethiopians and the Libyans a huge army with very many chariots and horsemen? Yet because you relied on the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, he gave them into your hand.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For the eyes of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to give strong support to those whose heart is blameless<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or whole">b</a></sup></span> toward him. You have done foolishly in this, for from now on you will have wars.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then Asa was angry with the seer and put him in the stocks in prison, for he was in a rage with him because of this. And Asa inflicted cruelties upon some of the people at the same time.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>The acts of Asa, from first to last, are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>In the thirty-ninth year of his reign Asa was diseased in his feet, and his disease became severe. Yet even in his disease he did not seek the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, but sought help from physicians.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And Asa slept with his fathers, dying in the forty-first year of his reign.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>They buried him in the tomb that he had cut for himself in the city of David. They laid him on a bier that had been filled with various kinds of spices prepared by the perfumer&#8217;s art, and they made a very great fire in his honor.</p><A name="footnotes"></a><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">3</span> Or <i>treaty</i>; twice in this verse<br /><span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">9</span> Or <i>whole</i><br /></span></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
