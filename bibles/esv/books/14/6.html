<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>But I have built you an exalted house, a place for you to dwell in forever.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then the king turned around and blessed all the assembly of Israel, while all the assembly of Israel stood.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;Blessed be the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, who with his hand has fulfilled what he promised with his mouth to David my father, saying,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8216;Since the day that I brought my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel in which to build a house, that my name might be there, and I chose no man as prince over my people Israel;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>but I have chosen Jerusalem that my name may be there, and I have chosen David to be over my people Israel.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to David my father, &#8216;Whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name, you did well that it was in your heart.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Nevertheless, it is not you who shall build the house, but your son who shall be born to you shall build the house for my name.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Now the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has fulfilled his promise that he made. For I have risen in the place of David my father and sit on the throne of Israel, as the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> promised, and I have built the house for the name of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And there I have set the ark, in which is the covenant of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> that he made with the people of Israel.&#8221;</p>
<p class="heading">Solomon&#8217;s Prayer of Dedication</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then Solomon stood before the altar of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> in the presence of all the assembly of Israel and spread out his hands.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Solomon had made a bronze platform five cubits<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="A cubit was about 18 inches or 45 centimeters">a</a></sup></span> long, five cubits wide, and three cubits high, and had set it in the court, and he stood on it. Then he knelt on his knees in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread out his hands toward heaven,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>and said, &#8220;O <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, God of Israel, there is no God like you, in heaven or on earth, keeping covenant and showing steadfast love to your servants who walk before you with all their heart,

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Now therefore, O <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, God of Israel, keep for your servant David my father what you have promised him, saying, &#8216;You shall not lack a man to sit before me on the throne of Israel, if only your sons pay close attention to their way, to walk in my law as you have walked before me.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Now therefore, O <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, God of Israel, let your word be confirmed, which you have spoken to your servant David.</p>
