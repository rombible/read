<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he did what was right in the eyes of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and walked in the ways of David his father; and he did not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet a boy, he began to seek the God of David his father, and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem of the high places, the Asherim, and the carved and the metal images.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And they chopped down the altars of the Baals in his presence, and he cut down the incense altars that stood above them. And he broke in pieces the Asherim and the carved and the metal images, and he made dust of them and scattered it over the graves of those who had sacrificed to them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>He also burned the bones of the priests on their altars and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.

<p class="heading">The Book of the Law Found</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had cleansed the land and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz, the recorder, to repair the house of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> his God.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>They came to Hilkiah the high priest and gave him the money that had been brought into the house of God, which the Levites, the keepers of the threshold, had collected from Manasseh and Ephraim and from all the remnant of Israel and from all Judah and Benjamin and from the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And they gave it to the workmen who were working in the house of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>They gave it to the carpenters and the builders to buy quarried stone, and timber for binders and beams for the buildings that the kings of Judah had let go to ruin.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And the men did the work faithfully. Over them were set Jahath and Obadiah the Levites, of the sons of Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to have oversight. The Levites, all who were skillful with instruments of music,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>were over the burden-bearers and directed all who did work in every kind of service, and some of the Levites were scribes and officials and gatekeepers.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>While they were bringing out the money that had been brought into the house of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, Hilkiah the priest found the Book of the Law of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> given through<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew by the hand of">b</a></sup></span> Moses.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the secretary, &#8220;I have found the Book of the Law in the house of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221; And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Shaphan brought the book to the king, and further reported to the king, &#8220;All that was committed to your servants they are doing.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then Shaphan the secretary told the king, &#8220;Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.&#8221; And Shaphan read from it before the king.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And when the king heard the words of the Law, he tore his clothes.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And the king commanded Hilkiah, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Abdon the son of Micah, Shaphan the secretary, and Asaiah the king&#8217;s servant, saying,

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And she said to them, &#8220;Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel: &#8216;Tell the man who sent you to me,

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Because they have forsaken me and have made offerings to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands, therefore my wrath will be poured out on this place and will not be quenched.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, and your eyes shall not see all the disaster that I will bring upon this place and its inhabitants.&#8217;&#8221; And they brought back word to the king.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
