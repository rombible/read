<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Some men came and told Jehoshaphat, &#8220;A great multitude is coming against you from Edom,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="One Hebrew manuscript; most Hebrew manuscripts Aram (Syria)">b</a></sup></span> from beyond the sea; and, behold, they are in Hazazon-tamar&#8221; (that is, Engedi).
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then Jehoshaphat was afraid and set his face to seek the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And Judah assembled to seek help from the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>; from all the cities of Judah they came to seek the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, before the new court,

You rule over all the kingdoms of the nations. In your hand are power and might, so that none is able to withstand you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Did you not, our God, drive out the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel, and give it forever to the descendants of Abraham your friend?

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And now behold, the men of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir, whom you would not let Israel invade when they came from the land of Egypt, and whom they avoided and did not destroy&#8212;

<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Meanwhile all Judah stood before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, with their little ones, their wives, and their children.

<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground, and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, worshiping the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And the Levites, of the Kohathites and the Korahites, stood up to praise the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, with a very loud voice.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And when he had taken counsel with the people, he appointed those who were to sing to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and praise him in holy attire, as they went before the army, and say,</p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">&#8220;Give thanks to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>,</span><br /><span class="indent">for his steadfast love endures forever.&#8221;</span></p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>For the men of Ammon and Moab rose against the inhabitants of Mount Seir, devoting them to destruction, and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, they all helped to destroy one another.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>When Jehoshaphat and his people came to take their spoil, they found among them, in great numbers, goods, clothing, and precious things, which they took for themselves until they could carry no more.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>On the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of Beracah,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Beracah means blessing">f</a></sup></span> for there they blessed the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat at their head, returning to Jerusalem with joy, for the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> had made them rejoice over their enemies.
