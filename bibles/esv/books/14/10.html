<div class="chap"><p class="heading">The Revolt Against Rehoboam</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And as soon as Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it (for he was in Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon), then Jeroboam returned from Egypt.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all Israel came and said to Rehoboam,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8220;Your father made our yoke heavy. Now therefore lighten the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke on us, and we will serve you.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>He said to them, &#8220;Come to me again in three days.&#8221; So the people went away.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or the elders; also verses 8, 13">a</a></sup></span> who had stood before Solomon his father while he was yet alive, saying, &#8220;How do you advise me to answer this people?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And they said to him, &#8220;If you will be good to this people and please them and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But he abandoned the counsel that the old men gave him, and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him and stood before him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And he said to them, &#8220;What do you advise that we answer this people who have said to me, &#8216;Lighten the yoke that your father put on us&#8217;?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And the young men who had grown up with him said to him, &#8220;Thus shall you speak to the people who said to you, &#8216;Your father made our yoke heavy, but you lighten it for us&#8217;; thus shall you say to them, &#8216;My little finger is thicker than my father&#8217;s thighs.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And now, whereas my father laid on you a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king said, &#8220;Come to me again the third day.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And the king answered them harshly; and forsaking the counsel of the old men,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>King Rehoboam spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, &#8220;My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So the king did not listen to the people, for it was a turn of affairs brought about by God that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> might fulfill his word, which he spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And when all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people answered the king, &#8220;What portion have we in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. Each of you to your tents, O Israel! Look now to your own house, David.&#8221; So all Israel went to their tents.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But Rehoboam reigned over the people of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Spelled Adoram in 1 Kings 12:18">b</a></sup></span> who was taskmaster over the forced labor, and the people of Israel stoned him to death with stones. And King Rehoboam quickly mounted his chariot to flee to Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.</p><A name="footnotes"></a><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">6</span> Or <i><span class="catch-word">the</span> elders</i>; also verses 8, 13<br /><span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">18</span> Spelled <i>Adoram</i> in 1 Kings 12:18<br /></span></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
