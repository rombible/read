His mother&#8217;s name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he did what was right in the eyes of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> according to all that his father Uzziah had done, except he did not enter the temple of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. But the people still followed corrupt practices.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>He built the upper gate of the house of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and did much building on the wall of Ophel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Moreover, he built cities in the hill country of Judah, and forts and towers on the wooded hills.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>He fought with the king of the Ammonites and prevailed against them. And the Ammonites gave him that year 100 talents<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="A talent was about 75 pounds or 34 kilograms">a</a></sup></span> of silver, and 10,000 cors<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="A cor was about 6 bushels or 220 liters">b</a></sup></span> of wheat and 10,000 of barley. The Ammonites paid him the same amount in the second and the third years.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So Jotham became mighty, because he ordered his ways before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> his God.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars and his ways, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David, and Ahaz his son reigned in his place.</p><A name="footnotes"></a><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">5</span> A <i class="catch-word-plural">talent</i> was about 75 pounds or 34 kilograms<br /><span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">5</span> A <i class="catch-word-plural">cor</i> was about 6 bushels or 220 liters<br /></span></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
