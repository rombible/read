<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>He reigned for three years in Jerusalem. His mother&#8217;s name was Micaiah<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Spelled Maacah in 1 Kings 15:2">a</a></sup></span> the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah.</p><p class="regular">Now there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Abijah went out to battle, having an army of valiant men of war, 400,000 chosen men. And Jeroboam drew up his line of battle against him with 800,000 chosen mighty warriors.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then Abijah stood up on Mount Zemaraim that is in the hill country of Ephraim and said, &#8220;Hear me, O Jeroboam and all Israel!
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Ought you not to know that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel gave the kingship over Israel forever to David and his sons by a covenant of salt?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, a servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up and rebelled against his lord,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and certain worthless scoundrels<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew worthless men, sons of Belial">b</a></sup></span> gathered about him and defied Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and irresolute<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew soft of heart">c</a></sup></span> and could not withstand them.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8220;And now you think to withstand the kingdom of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> in the hand of the sons of David, because you are a great multitude and have with you the golden calves that Jeroboam made you for gods.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Have you not driven out the priests of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made priests for yourselves like the peoples of other lands? Whoever comes for ordination<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew to fill his hand">d</a></sup></span> with a young bull or seven rams becomes a priest of what are not gods.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>But as for us, the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> is our God, and we have not forsaken him. We have priests ministering to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> who are sons of Aaron, and Levites for their service.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>They offer to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> every morning and every evening burnt offerings and incense of sweet spices, set out the showbread on the table of pure gold, and care for the golden lampstand that its lamps may burn every evening. For we keep the charge of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> our God, but you have forsaken him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Behold, God is with us at our head, and his priests with their battle trumpets to sound the call to battle against you. O sons of Israel, do not fight against the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of your fathers, for you cannot succeed.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Jeroboam had sent an ambush around to come upon them from behind. Thus his troops<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew they">e</a></sup></span> were in front of Judah, and the ambush was behind them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And when Judah looked, behold, the battle was in front of and behind them. And they cried to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and the priests blew the trumpets.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then the men of Judah raised the battle shout. And when the men of Judah shouted, God defeated Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>The men of Israel fled before Judah, and God gave them into their hand.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Abijah and his people struck them with great force, so there fell slain of Israel 500,000 chosen men.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Thus the men of Israel were subdued at that time, and the men of Judah prevailed, because they relied on the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of their fathers.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And Abijah pursued Jeroboam and took cities from him, Bethel with its villages and Jeshanah with its villages and Ephron<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or Ephrain">f</a></sup></span> with its villages.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Jeroboam did not recover his power in the days of Abijah. And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> struck him down, and he died.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>But Abijah grew mighty. And he took fourteen wives and had twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>The rest of the acts of Abijah, his ways and his sayings, are written in the story of the prophet Iddo.</p><A name="footnotes"></a><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">2</span> Spelled <i>Maacah</i> in 1 Kings 15:2<br /><span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">7</span> Hebrew <i>worthless men, sons of Belial</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <span class="fnverse">7</span> Hebrew <i>soft of heart</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">d</span> <span class="fnverse">9</span> Hebrew <i>to fill his hand</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">e</span> <span class="fnverse">13</span> Hebrew <i>they</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">f</span> <span class="fnverse">19</span> Or <i>Ephrain</i><br /></span></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
