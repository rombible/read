<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>He placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim that Asa his father had captured.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the earlier ways of his father David. He did not seek the Baals,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>but sought the God of his father and walked in his commandments, and not according to the practices of Israel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Therefore the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> established the kingdom in his hand. And all Judah brought tribute to Jehoshaphat, and he had great riches and honor.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>His heart was courageous in the ways of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. And furthermore, he took the high places and the Asherim out of Judah.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>In the third year of his reign he sent his officials, Ben-hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>and with them the Levites, Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tobadonijah; and with these Levites, the priests Elishama and Jehoram.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And they taught in Judah, having the Book of the Law of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> with them. They went about through all the cities of Judah and taught among the people.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And the fear of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were around Judah, and they made no war against Jehoshaphat.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents and silver for tribute, and the Arabians also brought him 7,700 rams and 7,700 goats.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And Jehoshaphat grew steadily greater. He built in Judah fortresses and store cities,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>and he had large supplies in the cities of Judah. He had soldiers, mighty men of valor, in Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>This was the muster of them by fathers&#8217; houses: Of Judah, the commanders of thousands: Adnah the commander, with 300,000 mighty men of valor;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and next to him Jehohanan the commander, with 280,000;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri, a volunteer for the service of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, with 200,000 mighty men of valor.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Of Benjamin: Eliada, a mighty man of valor, with 200,000 men armed with bow and shield;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>and next to him Jehozabad with 180,000 armed for war.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>These were in the service of the king, besides those whom the king had placed in the fortified cities throughout all Judah.</p></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
