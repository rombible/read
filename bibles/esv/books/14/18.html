<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>After some years he went down to Ahab in Samaria. And Ahab killed an abundance of sheep and oxen for him and for the people who were with him, and induced him to go up against Ramoth-gilead.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, &#8220;Will you go with me to Ramoth-gilead?&#8221; He answered him, &#8220;I am as you are, my people as your people. We will be with you in the war.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, &#8220;Inquire first for the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, four hundred men, and said to them, &#8220;Shall we go to battle against Ramoth-gilead, or shall I refrain?&#8221; And they said, &#8220;Go up, for God will give it into the hand of the king.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But Jehoshaphat said, &#8220;Is there not here another prophet of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of whom we may inquire?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, &#8220;There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, Micaiah the son of Imlah; but I hate him, for he never prophesies good concerning me, but always evil.&#8221; And Jehoshaphat said, &#8220;Let not the king say so.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then the king of Israel summoned an officer and said, &#8220;Bring quickly Micaiah the son of Imlah.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting on their thrones, arrayed in their robes. And they were sitting at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria, and all the prophets were prophesying before them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made for himself horns of iron and said, &#8220;Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, &#8216;With these you shall push the Syrians until they are destroyed.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And all the prophets prophesied so and said, &#8220;Go up to Ramoth-gilead and triumph. The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> will give it into the hand of the king.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And the messenger who went to summon Micaiah said to him, &#8220;Behold, the words of the prophets with one accord are favorable to the king. Let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak favorably.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>But Micaiah said, &#8220;As the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> lives, what my God says, that I will speak.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And when he had come to the king, the king said to him, &#8220;Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I refrain?&#8221; And he answered, &#8220;Go up and triumph; they will be given into your hand.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But the king said to him, &#8220;How many times shall I make you swear that you speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, &#8220;Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And Micaiah said, &#8220;Therefore hear the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>: I saw the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said, &#8216;Who will entice Ahab the king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?&#8217; And one said one thing, and another said another.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then a spirit came forward and stood before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, saying, &#8216;I will entice him.&#8217; And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to him, &#8216;By what means?&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And he said, &#8216;I will go out, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.&#8217; And he said, &#8216;You are to entice him, and you shall succeed; go out and do so.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Now therefore behold, the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these your prophets.

<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near and struck Micaiah on the cheek and said, &#8220;Which way did the Spirit of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> go from me to speak to you?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And Micaiah said, &#8220;Behold, you shall see on that day when you go into an inner chamber to hide yourself.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And the king of Israel said, &#8220;Seize Micaiah and take him back to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king&#8217;s son,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>and say, &#8216;Thus says the king, Put this fellow in prison and feed him with meager rations of bread and water until I return in peace.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And Micaiah said, &#8220;If you return in peace, the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has not spoken by me.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Hear, all you peoples!&#8221;</p>
<p class="heading">The Defeat and Death of Ahab</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, &#8220;I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you wear your robes.&#8221; And the king of Israel disguised himself, and they went into battle.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of his chariots, &#8220;Fight with neither small nor great, but only with the king of Israel.&#8221;

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>For as soon as the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him.
