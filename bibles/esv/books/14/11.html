<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>But the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> came to Shemaiah the man of God:
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8220;Say to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8216;Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, You shall not go up or fight against your relatives.

<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem, and he built cities for defense in Judah.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For the Levites left their common lands and their holdings and came to Judah and Jerusalem, because Jeroboam and his sons cast them out from serving as priests of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and he appointed his own priests for the high places and for the goat idols and for the calves that he had made.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>They strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and for three years they made Rehoboam the son of Solomon secure, for they walked for three years in the way of David and Solomon.</p>
