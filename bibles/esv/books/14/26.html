<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>He built Eloth and restored it to Judah, after the king slept with his fathers.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Uzziah was sixteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother&#8217;s name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And he did what was right in the eyes of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, according to all that his father Amaziah had done.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>He set himself to seek God in the days of Zechariah, who instructed him in the fear of God, and as long as he sought the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, God made him prosper.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>He went out and made war against the Philistines and broke through the wall of Gath and the wall of Jabneh and the wall of Ashdod, and he built cities in the territory of Ashdod and elsewhere among the Philistines.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>God helped him against the Philistines and against the Arabians who lived in Gurbaal and against the Meunites.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>The Ammonites paid tribute to Uzziah, and his fame spread even to the border of Egypt, for he became very strong.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Moreover, Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate and at the Valley Gate and at the Angle, and fortified them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And he built towers in the wilderness and cut out many cisterns, for he had large herds, both in the Shephelah and in the plain, and he had farmers and vinedressers in the hills and in the fertile lands, for he loved the soil.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Moreover, Uzziah had an army of soldiers, fit for war, in divisions according to the numbers in the muster made by Jeiel the secretary and Maaseiah the officer, under the direction of Hananiah, one of the king&#8217;s commanders.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>The whole number of the heads of fathers&#8217; houses of mighty men of valor was 2,600.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Under their command was an army of 307,500, who could make war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And Uzziah prepared for all the army shields, spears, helmets, coats of mail, bows, and stones for slinging.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>In Jerusalem he made machines, invented by skillful men, to be on the towers and the corners, to shoot arrows and great stones. And his fame spread far, for he was marvelously helped, till he was strong.</p>
<p class="heading">Uzziah&#8217;s Pride and Punishment</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But when he was strong, he grew proud, to his destruction. For he was unfaithful to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> his God and entered the temple of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> to burn incense on the altar of incense.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But Azariah the priest went in after him, with eighty priests of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> who were men of valor,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>and they withstood King Uzziah and said to him, &#8220;It is not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, but for the priests, the sons of Aaron, who are consecrated to burn incense. Go out of the sanctuary, for you have done wrong, and it will bring you no honor from the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> God.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then Uzziah was angry. Now he had a censer in his hand to burn incense, and when he became angry with the priests, leprosy<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Leprosy was a term for several skin diseases; see Leviticus 13">a</a></sup></span> broke out on his forehead in the presence of the priests in the house of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, by the altar of incense.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And Azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked at him, and behold, he was leprous in his forehead! And they rushed him out quickly, and he himself hurried to go out, because the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> had struck him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And King Uzziah was a leper to the day of his death, and being a leper lived in a separate house, for he was excluded from the house of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.
