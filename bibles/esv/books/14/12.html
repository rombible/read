<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Egypt Plunders Jerusalem</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>When the rule of Rehoboam was established and he was strong, he abandoned the law of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and all Israel with him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>In the fifth year of King Rehoboam, because they had been unfaithful to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>with 1,200 chariots and 60,000 horsemen. And the people were without number who came with him from Egypt&#8212;Libyans, Sukkiim, and Ethiopians.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And he took the fortified cities of Judah and came as far as Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and to the princes of Judah, who had gathered at Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, &#8220;Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, &#8216;You abandoned me, so I have abandoned you to the hand of Shishak.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, &#8220;The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> is righteous.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>When the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> came to Shemaiah: &#8220;They have humbled themselves. I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance, and my wrath shall not be poured out on Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Nevertheless, they shall be servants to him, that they may know my service and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem. He took away the treasures of the house of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and the treasures of the king&#8217;s house. He took away everything. He also took away the shields of gold that Solomon had made,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and King Rehoboam made in their place shields of bronze and committed them to the hands of the officers of the guard, who kept the door of the king&#8217;s house.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And as often as the king went into the house of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the guard came and carried them and brought them back to the guardroom.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And when he humbled himself the wrath of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> turned from him, so as not to make a complete destruction. Moreover, conditions were good<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew good things were found">a</a></sup></span> in Judah.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So King Rehoboam grew strong in Jerusalem and reigned. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to put his name there. His mother&#8217;s name was Naamah the Ammonite.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And he did evil, for he did not set his heart to seek the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.</p>
