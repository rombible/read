The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Beloved, we are God&#8217;s children now, and what we will be has not yet appeared; but we know that when he appears<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or when it appears">a</a></sup></span> we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And everyone who thus hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness; sin is lawlessness.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>You know that he appeared in order to take away sins, and in him there is no sin.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>No one who abides in him keeps on sinning; no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Little children, let no one deceive you. Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God&#8217;s<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek his">b</a></sup></span> seed abides in him; and he cannot keep on sinning, because he has been born of God.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>By this it is evident who are the children of God, and who are the children of the devil: whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is the one who does not love his brother.</p>
<p class="heading">Love One Another</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For this is the message that you have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>We should not be like Cain, who was of the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own deeds were evil and his brother&#8217;s righteous.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers. Whoever does not love abides in death.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But if anyone has the world&#8217;s goods and sees his brother in need, yet closes his heart against him, how does God&#8217;s love abide in him?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Little children, let us not love in word or talk but in deed and in truth.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>By this we shall know that we are of the truth and reassure our heart before him;
