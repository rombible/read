<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And fire came out from before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and consumed them, and they died before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then Moses said to Aaron, &#8220;This is what the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has said: &#8216;Among those who are near me I will be sanctified, and before all the people I will be glorified.&#8217;&#8221; And Aaron held his peace.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, &#8220;Come near; carry your brothers away from the front of the sanctuary and out of the camp.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So they came near and carried them in their coats out of the camp, as Moses had said.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And Moses said to Aaron and to Eleazar and Ithamar his sons, &#8220;Do not let the hair of your heads hang loose, and do not tear your clothes, lest you die, and wrath come upon all the congregation; but let your brothers, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has kindled.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And do not go outside the entrance of the tent of meeting, lest you die, for the anointing oil of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> is upon you.&#8221; And they did according to the word of Moses.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Aaron, saying,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;Drink no wine or strong drink, you or your sons with you, when you go into the tent of meeting, lest you die. It shall be a statute forever throughout your generations.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>You are to distinguish between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean,

<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Moses spoke to Aaron and to Eleazar and Ithamar, his surviving sons: &#8220;Take the grain offering that is left of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s food offerings, and eat it unleavened beside the altar, for it is most holy.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>You shall eat it in a holy place, because it is your due and your sons&#8217; due, from the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s food offerings, for so I am commanded.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But the breast that is waved and the thigh that is contributed you shall eat in a clean place, you and your sons and your daughters with you, for they are given as your due and your sons&#8217; due from the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the people of Israel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>The thigh that is contributed and the breast that is waved they shall bring with the food offerings of the fat pieces to wave for a wave offering before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and it shall be yours and your sons&#8217; with you as a due forever, as the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has commanded.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Now Moses diligently inquired about the goat of the sin offering, and behold, it was burned up! And he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the surviving sons of Aaron, saying,

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Behold, its blood was not brought into the inner part of the sanctuary. You certainly ought to have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded.&#8221;
