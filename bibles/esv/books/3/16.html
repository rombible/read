<div class="chap"><p class="heading">The Day of Atonement</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they drew near before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and died,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;Tell Aaron your brother not to come at any time into the Holy Place inside the veil, before the mercy seat that is on the ark, so that he may not die. For I will appear in the cloud over the mercy seat.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But in this way Aaron shall come into the Holy Place: with a bull from the herd for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>He shall put on the holy linen coat and shall have the linen undergarment on his body, and he shall tie the linen sash around his waist, and wear the linen turban; these are the holy garments. He shall bathe his body in water and then put them on.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And he shall take from the congregation of the people of Israel two male goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>&#8220;Aaron shall offer the bull as a sin offering for himself and shall make atonement for himself and for his house.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then he shall take the two goats and set them before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And Aaron shall cast lots over the two goats, one lot for the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and the other lot for Azazel.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="The meaning of Azazel is uncertain; possibly the name of a place or a demon, traditionally a scapegoat; also verses 10, 26">a</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And Aaron shall present the goat on which the lot fell for the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and use it as a sin offering,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>but the goat on which the lot fell for Azazel shall be presented alive before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> to make atonement over it, that it may be sent away into the wilderness to Azazel.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And he shall take a censer full of coals of fire from the altar before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and two handfuls of sweet incense beaten small, and he shall bring it inside the veil
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>and put the incense on the fire before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is over the testimony, so that he does not die.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And he shall take some of the blood of the bull and sprinkle it with his finger on the front of the mercy seat on the east side, and in front of the mercy seat he shall sprinkle some of the blood with his finger seven times.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>&#8220;Then he shall kill the goat of the sin offering that is for the people and bring its blood inside the veil and do with its blood as he did with the blood of the bull, sprinkling it over the mercy seat and in front of the mercy seat.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Thus he shall make atonement for the Holy Place, because of the uncleannesses of the people of Israel and because of their transgressions, all their sins.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>No one may be in the tent of meeting from the time he enters to make atonement in the Holy Place until he comes out and has made atonement for himself and for his house and for all the assembly of Israel.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And he shall sprinkle some of the blood on it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it and consecrate it from the uncleannesses of the people of Israel.</p>
