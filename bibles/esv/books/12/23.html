<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And the king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, to walk after the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book.

<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest and the priests of the second order and the keepers of the threshold to bring out of the temple of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> all the vessels made for Baal, for Asherah, and for all the host of heaven. He burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron and carried their ashes to Bethel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And he deposed the priests whom the kings of Judah had ordained to make offerings in the high places at the cities of Judah and around Jerusalem; those also who burned incense to Baal, to the sun and the moon and the constellations and all the host of the heavens.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And he brought out the Asherah from the house of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, outside Jerusalem, to the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron and beat it to dust and cast the dust of it upon the graves of the common people.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And he broke down the houses of the male cult prostitutes who were in the house of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, where the women wove hangings for the Asherah.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had made offerings, from Geba to Beersheba.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And the king defiled the high places that were east of Jerusalem, to the south of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And he broke in pieces the pillars and cut down the Asherim and filled their places with the bones of men.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then he said, &#8220;What is that monument that I see?&#8221; And the men of the city told him, &#8220;It is the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and predicted<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew called">e</a></sup></span> these things that you have done against the altar at Bethel.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;Let him be; let no man move his bones.&#8221; So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet who came out of Samaria.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And Josiah removed all the shrines also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which kings of Israel had made, provoking the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> to anger.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And he sacrificed all the priests of the high places who were there, on the altars, and burned human bones on them. Then he returned to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="heading">Josiah Restores the Passover</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And the king commanded all the people, &#8220;Keep the Passover to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God, as it is written in this Book of the Covenant.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>For no such Passover had been kept since the days of the judges who judged Israel, or during all the days of the kings of Israel or of the kings of Judah.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>But in the eighteenth year of King Josiah this Passover was kept to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Moreover, Josiah put away the mediums and the necromancers and the household gods and the idols and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, that he might establish the words of the law that were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.
