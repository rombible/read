So Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria, to the rulers of the city,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Septuagint, Vulgate; Hebrew rulers of Jezreel">a</a></sup></span> to the elders, and to the guardians of the sons<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew lacks of the sons">b</a></sup></span> of Ahab, saying,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Now then, as soon as this letter comes to you, seeing your master&#8217;s sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, fortified cities also, and weapons,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>select the best and fittest of your master&#8217;s sons and set him on his father&#8217;s throne and fight for your master&#8217;s house.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But they were exceedingly afraid and said, &#8220;Behold, the two kings could not stand before him. How then can we stand?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So he who was over the palace, and he who was over the city, together with the elders and the guardians, sent to Jehu, saying, &#8220;We are your servants, and we will do all that you tell us. We will not make anyone king. Do whatever is good in your eyes.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then he wrote to them a second letter, saying, &#8220;If you are on my side, and if you are ready to obey me, take the heads of your master&#8217;s sons and come to me at Jezreel tomorrow at this time.&#8221; Now the king&#8217;s sons, seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, who were bringing them up.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And as soon as the letter came to them, they took the king&#8217;s sons and slaughtered them, seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets and sent them to him at Jezreel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>When the messenger came and told him, &#8220;They have brought the heads of the king&#8217;s sons,&#8221; he said, &#8220;Lay them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then in the morning, when he went out, he stood and said to all the people, &#8220;You are innocent. It was I who conspired against my master and killed him, but who struck down all these?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Know then that there shall fall to the earth nothing of the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, which the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> spoke concerning the house of Ahab, for the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has done what he said by his servant Elijah.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So Jehu struck down all who remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, all his great men and his close friends and his priests, until he left him none remaining.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then he set out and went to Samaria. On the way, when he was at Beth-eked of the Shepherds,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Jehu met the relatives of Ahaziah king of Judah, and he said, &#8220;Who are you?&#8221; And they answered, &#8220;We are the relatives of Ahaziah, and we came down to visit the royal princes and the sons of the queen mother.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>He said, &#8220;Take them alive.&#8221; And they took them alive and slaughtered them at the pit of Beth-eked, forty-two persons, and he spared none of them.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And when he departed from there, he met Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him. And he greeted him and said to him, &#8220;Is your heart true to my heart as mine is to yours?&#8221; And Jehonadab answered, &#8220;It is.&#8221; Jehu said,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Septuagint; Hebrew lacks Jehu said">c</a></sup></span> &#8220;If it is, give me your hand.&#8221; So he gave him his hand. And Jehu took him up with him into the chariot.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;Come with me, and see my zeal for the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221; So he<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Septuagint, Syriac, Targum; Hebrew they">d</a></sup></span> had him ride in his chariot.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And when he came to Samaria, he struck down all who remained to Ahab in Samaria, till he had wiped them out, according to the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> that he spoke to Elijah.</p>
<p class="heading">Jehu Strikes Down the Prophets of Baal</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then Jehu assembled all the people and said to them, &#8220;Ahab served Baal a little, but Jehu will serve him much.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Now therefore call to me all the prophets of Baal, all his worshipers and all his priests. Let none be missing, for I have a great sacrifice to offer to Baal. Whoever is missing shall not live.&#8221; But Jehu did it with cunning in order to destroy the worshipers of Baal.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And Jehu ordered, &#8220;Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal.&#8221; So they proclaimed it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And Jehu sent throughout all Israel, and all the worshipers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left who did not come. And they entered the house of Baal, and the house of Baal was filled from one end to the other.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>He said to him who was in charge of the wardrobe, &#8220;Bring out the vestments for all the worshipers of Baal.&#8221; So he brought out the vestments for them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Then Jehu went into the house of Baal with Jehonadab the son of Rechab, and he said to the worshipers of Baal, &#8220;Search, and see that there is no servant of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> here among you, but only the worshipers of Baal.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then they<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Septuagint he (compare verse 25)">e</a></sup></span> went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings.</p><p class="regular">Now Jehu had stationed eighty men outside and said, &#8220;The man who allows any of those whom I give into your hands to escape shall forfeit his life.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>So as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, Jehu said to the guard and to the officers, &#8220;Go in and strike them down; let not a man escape.&#8221; So when they put them to the sword, the guard and the officers cast them out and went into the inner room of the house of Baal,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>and they brought out the pillar that was in the house of Baal and burned it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And they demolished the pillar of Baal, and demolished the house of Baal, and made it a latrine to this day.</p>
<p class="heading">Jehu Reigns in Israel</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Thus Jehu wiped out Baal from Israel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>But Jehu did not turn aside from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel to sin&#8212;that is, the golden calves that were in Bethel and in Dan.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to Jehu, &#8220;Because you have done well in carrying out what is right in my eyes, and have done to the house of Ahab according to all that was in my heart, your sons of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>But Jehu was not careful to walk in the law of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, with all his heart. He did not turn from the sins of Jeroboam, which he made Israel to sin.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>In those days the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> began to cut off parts of Israel. Hazael defeated them throughout the territory of Israel:

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Now the rest of the acts of Jehu and all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
