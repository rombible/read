And they built siegeworks all around it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So the city was besieged till the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>On the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, by the king&#8217;s garden, and the Chaldeans were around the city. And they went in the direction of the Arabah.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook him in the plains of Jericho, and all his army was scattered from him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then they captured the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah, and they passed sentence on him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>They slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah and bound him in chains and took him to Babylon.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And he burned the house of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and the king&#8217;s house and all the houses of Jerusalem; every great house he burned down.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And all the army of the Chaldeans, who were with the captain of the guard, broke down the walls around Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And the rest of the people who were left in the city and the deserters who had deserted to the king of Babylon, together with the rest of the multitude, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried into exile.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and plowmen.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And the pillars of bronze that were in the house of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and the stands and the bronze sea that were in the house of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the Chaldeans broke in pieces and carried the bronze to Babylon.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And they took away the pots and the shovels and the snuffers and the dishes for incense and all the vessels of bronze used in the temple service,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>the fire pans also and the bowls. What was of gold the captain of the guard took away as gold, and what was of silver, as silver.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>As for the two pillars, the one sea, and the stands that Solomon had made for the house of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the bronze of all these vessels was beyond weight.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="A cubit was about 18 inches or 45 centimeters">a</a></sup></span> and on it was a capital of bronze.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.

<p class="heading">Gedaliah Made Governor of Judah</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And over the people who remained in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, he appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, governor.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Now when all the captains and their men heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah governor, they came with their men to Gedaliah at Mizpah, namely, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>But in the seventh month, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, son of Elishama, of the royal family, came with ten men and struck down Gedaliah and put him to death along with the Jews and the Chaldeans who were with him at Mizpah.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Then all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the forces arose and went to Egypt, for they were afraid of the Chaldeans.</p>
