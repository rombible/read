<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So the woman arose and did according to the word of the man of God. She went with her household and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And at the end of the seven years, when the woman returned from the land of the Philistines, she went to appeal to the king for her house and her land.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Now the king was talking with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, &#8220;Tell me all the great things that Elisha has done.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And while he was telling the king how Elisha had restored the dead to life, behold, the woman whose son he had restored to life appealed to the king for her house and her land. And Gehazi said, &#8220;My lord, O king, here is the woman, and here is her son whom Elisha restored to life.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed an official for her, saying, &#8220;Restore all that was hers, together with all the produce of the fields from the day that she left the land until now.&#8221;</p>
<p class="heading">Hazael Murders Ben-hadad</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now Elisha came to Damascus. Ben-hadad the king of Syria was sick. And when it was told him, &#8220;The man of God has come here,&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>the king said to Hazael, &#8220;Take a present with you and go to meet the man of God, and inquire of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> through him, saying, &#8216;Shall I recover from this sickness?&#8217;&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, all kinds of goods of Damascus, forty camels&#8217; loads. When he came and stood before him, he said, &#8220;Your son Ben-hadad king of Syria has sent me to you, saying, &#8216;Shall I recover from this sickness?&#8217;&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And Elisha said to him, &#8220;Go, say to him, &#8216;You shall certainly recover,&#8217; but<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts say, 'You shall certainly not recover,' for">a</a></sup></span> the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has shown me that he shall certainly die.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And he fixed his gaze and stared at him, until he was embarrassed. And the man of God wept.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And Hazael said, &#8220;Why does my lord weep?&#8221; He answered, &#8220;Because I know the evil that you will do to the people of Israel. You will set on fire their fortresses, and you will kill their young men with the sword and dash in pieces their little ones and rip open their pregnant women.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And Hazael said, &#8220;What is your servant, who is but a dog, that he should do this great thing?&#8221; Elisha answered, &#8220;The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has shown me that you are to be king over Syria.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then he departed from Elisha and came to his master, who said to him, &#8220;What did Elisha say to you?&#8221; And he answered, &#8220;He told me that you would certainly recover.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But the next day he took the bed cloth<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain">b</a></sup></span> and dipped it in water and spread it over his face, till he died. And Hazael became king in his place.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Yet the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> was not willing to destroy Judah, for the sake of David his servant, since he promised to give a lamp to him and to his sons forever.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So Edom revolted from the rule of Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time.
