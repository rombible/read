<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Elijah Denounces Ahaziah</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>After the death of Ahab, Moab rebelled against Israel.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Now Ahaziah fell through the lattice in his upper chamber in Samaria, and lay sick; so he sent messengers, telling them, &#8220;Go, inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I shall recover from this sickness.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But the angel of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to Elijah the Tishbite, &#8220;Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say to them, &#8216;Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Now therefore thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, You shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up, but you shall surely die.&#8217;&#8221; So Elijah went.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>The messengers returned to the king, and he said to them, &#8220;Why have you returned?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And they said to him, &#8220;There came a man to meet us, and said to us, &#8216;Go back to the king who sent you, and say to him, Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up, but you shall surely die.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>He said to them, &#8220;What kind of man was he who came to meet you and told you these things?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>They answered him, &#8220;He wore a garment of hair, with a belt of leather about his waist.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;It is Elijah the Tishbite.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then the king sent to him a captain of fifty men with his fifty. He went up to Elijah, who was sitting on the top of a hill, and said to him, &#8220;O man of God, the king says, &#8216;Come down.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>But Elijah answered the captain of fifty, &#8220;If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty.&#8221; Then fire came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Again the king sent to him another captain of fifty men with his fifty. And he answered and said to him, &#8220;O man of God, this is the king&#8217;s order, &#8216;Come down quickly!&#8217;&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But Elijah answered them, &#8220;If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty.&#8221; Then the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Again the king sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up and came and fell on his knees before Elijah and entreated him, &#8220;O man of God, please let my life, and the life of these fifty servants of yours, be precious in your sight.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Behold, fire came down from heaven and consumed the two former captains of fifty men with their fifties, but now let my life be precious in your sight.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then the angel of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to Elijah, &#8220;Go down with him; do not be afraid of him.&#8221; So he arose and went down with him to the king
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>and said to him, &#8220;Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, &#8216;Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron&#8212;is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word?&#8212;therefore you shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up, but you shall surely die.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So he died according to the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> that Elijah had spoken. Jehoram became king in his place in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, because Ahaziah had no son.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</p></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
