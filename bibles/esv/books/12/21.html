<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Manasseh Reigns in Judah</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother&#8217;s name was Hephzibah.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he did what was evil in the sight of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, according to the despicable practices of the nations whom the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> drove out before the people of Israel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For he rebuilt the high places that Hezekiah his father had destroyed, and he erected altars for Baal and made an Asherah, as Ahab king of Israel had done, and worshiped all the host of heaven and served them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And he built altars in the house of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, of which the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> had said, &#8220;In Jerusalem will I put my name.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And he burned his son as an offering<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew made his son pass through the fire">a</a></sup></span> and used fortune-telling and omens and dealt with mediums and with necromancers. He did much evil in the sight of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, provoking him to anger.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And the carved image of Asherah that he had made he set in the house of which the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to David and to Solomon his son, &#8220;In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my name forever.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And I will not cause the feet of Israel to wander anymore out of the land that I gave to their fathers, if only they will be careful to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the Law that my servant Moses commanded them.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But they did not listen, and Manasseh led them astray to do more evil than the nations had done whom the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> destroyed before the people of Israel.</p>
<p class="heading">Manasseh&#8217;s Idolatry Denounced</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said by his servants the prophets,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8220;Because Manasseh king of Judah has committed these abominations and has done things more evil than all that the Amorites did, who were before him, and has made Judah also to sin with his idols,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>therefore thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel: Behold, I am bringing upon Jerusalem and Judah such disaster<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or evil">b</a></sup></span> that the ears of everyone who hears of it will tingle.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And I will stretch over Jerusalem the measuring line of Samaria, and the plumb line of the house of Ahab, and I will wipe Jerusalem as one wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And I will forsake the remnant of my heritage and give them into the hand of their enemies, and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>because they have done what is evil in my sight and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came out of Egypt, even to this day.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Moreover, Manasseh shed very much innocent blood, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another, besides the sin that he made Judah to sin so that they did what was evil in the sight of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh and all that he did, and the sin that he committed, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And Manasseh slept with his fathers and was buried in the garden of his house, in the garden of Uzza, and Amon his son reigned in his place.</p>
<p class="heading">Amon Reigns in Judah</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. His mother&#8217;s name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And he did what was evil in the sight of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, as Manasseh his father had done.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>He walked in all the way in which his father walked and served the idols that his father served and worshiped them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>He abandoned the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of his fathers, and did not walk in the way of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And the servants of Amon conspired against him and put the king to death in his house.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>But the people of the land struck down all those who had conspired against King Amon, and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place.
