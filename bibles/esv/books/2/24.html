<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins, and half of the blood he threw against the altar.

<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then Moses and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel went up,
