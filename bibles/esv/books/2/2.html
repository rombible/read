<div class="chap"><p class="heading">The Birth of Moses</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Now a man from the house of Levi went and took as his wife a Levite woman.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>The woman conceived and bore a son, and when she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him three months.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>When she could hide him no longer, she took for him a basket made of bulrushes<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew papyrus reeds">a</a></sup></span> and daubed it with bitumen and pitch. She put the child in it and placed it among the reeds by the river bank.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And his sister stood at a distance to know what would be done to him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river, while her young women walked beside the river. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her servant woman, and she took it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>When she opened it, she saw the child, and behold, the baby was crying. She took pity on him and said, &#8220;This is one of the Hebrews&#8217; children.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then his sister said to Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter, &#8220;Shall I go and call you a nurse from the Hebrew women to nurse the child for you?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter said to her, &#8220;Go.&#8221; So the girl went and called the child&#8217;s mother.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter said to her, &#8220;Take this child away and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages.&#8221; So the woman took the child and nursed him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>When the child grew older, she brought him to Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses, &#8220;Because,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I drew him out of the water.&#8221;<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Moses sounds like the Hebrew for draw out">b</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="heading">Moses Flees to Midian</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>One day, when Moses had grown up, he went out to his people and looked on their burdens, and he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his people.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew brothers">c</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>He looked this way and that, and seeing no one, he struck down the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>When he went out the next day, behold, two Hebrews were struggling together. And he said to the man in the wrong, &#8220;Why do you strike your companion?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>He answered, &#8220;Who made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you mean to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?&#8221; Then Moses was afraid, and thought, &#8220;Surely the thing is known.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>When Pharaoh heard of it, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from Pharaoh and stayed in the land of Midian. And he sat down by a well.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came and drew water and filled the troughs to water their father&#8217;s flock.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>The shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses stood up and saved them, and watered their flock.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>When they came home to their father Reuel, he said, &#8220;How is it that you have come home so soon today?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>They said, &#8220;An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds and even drew water for us and watered the flock.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>He said to his daughters, &#8220;Then where is he? Why have you left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And Moses was content to dwell with the man, and he gave Moses his daughter Zipporah.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>She gave birth to a son, and he called his name Gershom, for he said, &#8220;I have been a sojourner<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Gershom sounds like the Hebrew for sojourner">d</a></sup></span> in a foreign land.&#8221;</p>
