<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Israel Increases Greatly in Egypt</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>These are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt with Jacob, each with his household:
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>All the descendants of Jacob were seventy persons; Joseph was already in Egypt.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then Joseph died, and all his brothers and all that generation.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But the people of Israel were fruitful and increased greatly; they multiplied and grew exceedingly strong, so that the land was filled with them.</p>
<p class="heading">Pharaoh Oppresses Israel</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who did not know Joseph.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And he said to his people, &#8220;Behold, the people of Israel are too many and too mighty for us.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Come, let us deal shrewdly with them, lest they multiply, and, if war breaks out, they join our enemies and fight against us and escape from the land.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Therefore they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with heavy burdens. They built for Pharaoh store cities, Pithom and Raamses.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and the more they spread abroad. And the Egyptians were in dread of the people of Israel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So they ruthlessly made the people of Israel work as slaves
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>and made their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar and brick, and in all kinds of work in the field. In all their work they ruthlessly made them work as slaves.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was named Shiphrah and the other Puah,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>&#8220;When you serve as midwife to the Hebrew women and see them on the birthstool, if it is a son, you shall kill him, but if it is a daughter, she shall live.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But the midwives feared God and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them, but let the male children live.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>So the king of Egypt called the midwives and said to them, &#8220;Why have you done this, and let the male children live?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>The midwives said to Pharaoh, &#8220;Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women, for they are vigorous and give birth before the midwife comes to them.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So God dealt well with the midwives. And the people multiplied and grew very strong.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then Pharaoh commanded all his people, &#8220;Every son that is born to the Hebrews<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Samaritan, Septuagint, Targum; Hebrew lacks to the Hebrews">a</a></sup></span> you shall cast into the Nile, but you shall let every daughter live.&#8221;</p><A name="footnotes"></a><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">22</span> Samaritan, Septuagint, Targum; Hebrew lacks <i class="catch-word">to the Hebrews</i><br /></span></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
