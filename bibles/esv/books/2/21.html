<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>When you buy a Hebrew slave,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or servant; the Hebrew term 'ebed designates a range of social and economic roles; also verses 5, 6, 7, 20, 21, 26, 27, 32 (see Preface)">a</a></sup></span> he shall serve six years, and in the seventh he shall go out free, for nothing.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>If he comes in single, he shall go out single; if he comes in married, then his wife shall go out with him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall be her master&#8217;s, and he shall go out alone.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But if the slave plainly says, &#8216;I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free,&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>then his master shall bring him to God, and he shall bring him to the door or the doorpost. And his master shall bore his ear through with an awl, and he shall be his slave forever.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8220;When a man sells his daughter as a slave, she shall not go out as the male slaves do.

He shall have no right to sell her to a foreign people, since he has broken faith with her.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>If he designates her for his son, he shall deal with her as with a daughter.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>If he takes another wife to himself, he shall not diminish her food, her clothing, or her marital rights.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And if he does not do these three things for her, she shall go out for nothing, without payment of money.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But if a man willfully attacks another to kill him by cunning, you shall take him from my altar, that he may die.</p>
