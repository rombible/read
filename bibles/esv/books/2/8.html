<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>But if you refuse to let them go, behold, I will plague all your country with frogs.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>The Nile shall swarm with frogs that shall come up into your house and into your bedroom and on your bed and into the houses of your servants and your people,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or among your people">b</a></sup></span> and into your ovens and your kneading bowls.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But the magicians did the same by their secret arts and made frogs come up on the land of Egypt.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron and said, &#8220;Plead with the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> to take away the frogs from me and from my people, and I will let the people go to sacrifice to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Moses said to Pharaoh, &#8220;Be pleased to command me when I am to plead for you and for your servants and for your people, that the frogs be cut off from you and your houses and be left only in the Nile.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;Tomorrow.&#8221; Moses said, &#8220;Be it as you say, so that you may know that there is no one like the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> our God.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>The frogs shall go away from you and your houses and your servants and your people. They shall be left only in the Nile.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh, and Moses cried to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> about the frogs, as he had agreed with Pharaoh.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or which he had brought upon Pharaoh">d</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> did according to the word of Moses. The frogs died out in the houses, the courtyards, and the fields.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And they gathered them together in heaps, and the land stank.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But when Pharaoh saw that there was a respite, he hardened his heart and would not listen to them, as the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> had said.</p>
<p class="heading">The Third Plague: Gnats</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;Say to Aaron, &#8216;Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the earth, so that it may become gnats in all the land of Egypt.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And they did so. Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff and struck the dust of the earth, and there were gnats on man and beast. All the dust of the earth became gnats in all the land of Egypt.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>The magicians tried by their secret arts to produce gnats, but they could not. So there were gnats on man and beast.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, &#8220;This is the finger of God.&#8221; But Pharaoh&#8217;s heart was hardened, and he would not listen to them, as the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> had said.</p>
<p class="heading">The Fourth Plague: Flies</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;Rise up early in the morning and present yourself to Pharaoh, as he goes out to the water, and say to him, &#8216;Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, &#8220;Let my people go, that they may serve me.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Or else, if you will not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies on you and your servants and your people, and into your houses. And the houses of the Egyptians shall be filled with swarms of flies, and also the ground on which they stand.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But on that day I will set apart the land of Goshen, where my people dwell, so that no swarms of flies shall be there, that you may know that I am the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> in the midst of the earth.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or that I the LORD am in the land">e</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Thus I will put a division<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Septuagint, Vulgate; Hebrew set redemption">f</a></sup></span> between my people and your people. Tomorrow this sign shall happen.&#8221;&#8217;&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> did so. There came great swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh and into his servants&#8217; houses. Throughout all the land of Egypt the land was ruined by the swarms of flies.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron and said, &#8220;Go, sacrifice to your God within the land.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>But Moses said, &#8220;It would not be right to do so, for the offerings we shall sacrifice to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> our God are an abomination to the Egyptians. If we sacrifice offerings abominable to the Egyptians before their eyes, will they not stone us?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>We must go three days&#8217; journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> our God as he tells us.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>So Pharaoh said, &#8220;I will let you go to sacrifice to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God in the wilderness; only you must not go very far away. Plead for me.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Then Moses said, &#8220;Behold, I am going out from you and I will plead with the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, tomorrow. Only let not Pharaoh cheat again by not letting the people go to sacrifice to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>So Moses went out from Pharaoh and prayed to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.
