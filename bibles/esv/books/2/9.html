<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>For if you refuse to let them go and still hold them,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>behold, the hand of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> will fall with a very severe plague upon your livestock that are in the field, the horses, the donkeys, the camels, the herds, and the flocks.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt, so that nothing of all that belongs to the people of Israel shall die.&#8221;&#8217;&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> set a time, saying, &#8220;Tomorrow the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> will do this thing in the land.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And the next day the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> did this thing. All the livestock of the Egyptians died, but not one of the livestock of the people of Israel died.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And Pharaoh sent, and behold, not one of the livestock of Israel was dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.</p>
<p class="heading">The Sixth Plague: Boils</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses and Aaron, &#8220;Take handfuls of soot from the kiln, and let Moses throw them in the air in the sight of Pharaoh.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>It shall become fine dust over all the land of Egypt, and become boils breaking out in sores on man and beast throughout all the land of Egypt.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So they took soot from the kiln and stood before Pharaoh. And Moses threw it in the air, and it became boils breaking out in sores on man and beast.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils, for the boils came upon the magicians and upon all the Egyptians.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he did not listen to them, as the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> had spoken to Moses.</p>
<p class="heading">The Seventh Plague: Hail</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;Rise up early in the morning and present yourself before Pharaoh and say to him, &#8216;Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of the Hebrews, &#8220;Let my people go, that they may serve me.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For this time I will send all my plagues on you yourself,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew on your heart">a</a></sup></span> and on your servants and your people, so that you may know that there is none like me in all the earth.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>For by now I could have put out my hand and struck you and your people with pestilence, and you would have been cut off from the earth.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But for this purpose I have raised you up, to show you my power, so that my name may be proclaimed in all the earth.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>You are still exalting yourself against my people and will not let them go.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Behold, about this time tomorrow I will cause very heavy hail to fall, such as never has been in Egypt from the day it was founded until now.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Now therefore send, get your livestock and all that you have in the field into safe shelter, for every man and beast that is in the field and is not brought home will die when the hail falls on them.&#8221;&#8217;&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then whoever feared the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> among the servants of Pharaoh hurried his slaves and his livestock into the houses,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>but whoever did not pay attention to the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> left his slaves and his livestock in the field.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;Stretch out your hand toward heaven, so that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, on man and beast and every plant of the field, in the land of Egypt.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Then Moses stretched out his staff toward heaven, and the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> sent thunder and hail, and fire ran down to the earth. And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> rained hail upon the land of Egypt.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>There was hail and fire flashing continually in the midst of the hail, very heavy hail, such as had never been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>The hail struck down everything that was in the field in all the land of Egypt, both man and beast. And the hail struck down every plant of the field and broke every tree of the field.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Only in the land of Goshen, where the people of Israel were, was there no hail.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Then Pharaoh sent and called Moses and Aaron and said to them, &#8220;This time I have sinned; the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> is in the right, and I and my people are in the wrong.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Plead with the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, for there has been enough of God&#8217;s thunder and hail. I will let you go, and you shall stay no longer.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Moses said to him, &#8220;As soon as I have gone out of the city, I will stretch out my hands to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. The thunder will cease, and there will be no more hail, so that you may know that the earth is the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>But as for you and your servants, I know that you do not yet fear the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> God.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>(The flax and the barley were struck down, for the barley was in the ear and the flax was in bud.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>So Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh and stretched out his hands to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and the thunder and the hail ceased, and the rain no longer poured upon the earth.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>But when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunder had ceased, he sinned yet again and hardened his heart, he and his servants.
