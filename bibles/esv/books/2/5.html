<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Making Bricks Without Straw</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Afterward Moses and Aaron went and said to Pharaoh, &#8220;Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, &#8216;Let my people go, that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>But Pharaoh said, &#8220;Who is the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, that I should obey his voice and let Israel go? I do not know the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and moreover, I will not let Israel go.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then they said, &#8220;The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please let us go a three days&#8217; journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> our God, lest he fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But the king of Egypt said to them, &#8220;Moses and Aaron, why do you take the people away from their work? Get back to your burdens.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And Pharaoh said, &#8220;Behold, the people of the land are now many,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Samaritan they are now more numerous than the people of the land">a</a></sup></span> and you make them rest from their burdens!&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>The same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their foremen,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8220;You shall no longer give the people straw to make bricks, as in the past; let them go and gather straw for themselves.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But the number of bricks that they made in the past you shall impose on them, you shall by no means reduce it, for they are idle. Therefore they cry, &#8216;Let us go and offer sacrifice to our God.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Let heavier work be laid on the men that they may labor at it and pay no regard to lying words.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So the taskmasters and the foremen of the people went out and said to the people, &#8220;Thus says Pharaoh, &#8216;I will not give you straw.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Go and get your straw yourselves wherever you can find it, but your work will not be reduced in the least.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So the people were scattered throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>The taskmasters were urgent, saying, &#8220;Complete your work, your daily task each day, as when there was straw.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And the foremen of the people of Israel, whom Pharaoh&#8217;s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten and were asked, &#8220;Why have you not done all your task of making bricks today and yesterday, as in the past?&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then the foremen of the people of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, &#8220;Why do you treat your servants like this?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>No straw is given to your servants, yet they say to us, &#8216;Make bricks!&#8217; And behold, your servants are beaten; but the fault is in your own people.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But he said, &#8220;You are idle, you are idle; that is why you say, &#8216;Let us go and sacrifice to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Go now and work. No straw will be given you, but you must still deliver the same number of bricks.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>The foremen of the people of Israel saw that they were in trouble when they said, &#8220;You shall by no means reduce your number of bricks, your daily task each day.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>They met Moses and Aaron, who were waiting for them, as they came out from Pharaoh;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>and they said to them, &#8220;The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> look on you and judge, because you have made us stink in the sight of Pharaoh and his servants, and have put a sword in their hand to kill us.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then Moses turned to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and said, &#8220;O Lord, why have you done evil to this people? Why did you ever send me?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has done evil to this people, and you have not delivered your people at all.&#8221;</p><A name="footnotes"></a><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">5</span> Samaritan <i>they are now more numerous than the people of the land</i><br /></span></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
