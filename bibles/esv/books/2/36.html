<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab and every craftsman in whose mind the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> had put skill, everyone whose heart stirred him up to come to do the work.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And they received from Moses all the contribution that the people of Israel had brought for doing the work on the sanctuary. They still kept bringing him freewill offerings every morning,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>so that all the craftsmen who were doing every sort of task on the sanctuary came, each from the task that he was doing,
