<div class="chap"><p class="heading">The Burning Bush</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Now Moses was keeping the flock of his father-in-law, Jethro, the priest of Midian, and he led his flock to the west side of the wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of God.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And the angel of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush. He looked, and behold, the bush was burning, yet it was not consumed.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And Moses said, &#8220;I will turn aside to see this great sight, why the bush is not burned.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>When the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> saw that he turned aside to see, God called to him out of the bush, &#8220;Moses, Moses!&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Here I am.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then he said, &#8220;Do not come near; take your sandals off your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.&#8221; And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said, &#8220;I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters. I know their sufferings,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>and I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land to a good and broad land, a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And now, behold, the cry of the people of Israel has come to me, and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Come, I will send you to Pharaoh that you may bring my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But Moses said to God, &#8220;Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>He said, &#8220;But I will be with you, and this shall be the sign for you, that I have sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then Moses said to God, &#8220;If I come to the people of Israel and say to them, &#8216;The God of your fathers has sent me to you,&#8217; and they ask me, &#8216;What is his name?&#8217; what shall I say to them?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>God said to Moses, &#8220;<span class="divine-name">I am who I am</span>.&#8221;<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or I am what I am, or I will be what I will be">a</a></sup></span> And he said, &#8220;Say this to the people of Israel: &#8216;<span class="divine-name">I am</span> has sent me to you.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>God also said to Moses, &#8220;Say this to the people of Israel: &#8216;The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="The word LORD, when spelled with capital letters, stands for the divine name, YHWH, which is here connected with the verb hayah, to be in verse 14">b</a></sup></span> the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you.&#8217; This is my name forever, and thus I am to be remembered throughout all generations.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Go and gather the elders of Israel together and say to them, &#8216;The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has appeared to me, saying, &#8220;I have observed you and what has been done to you in Egypt,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>and I promise that I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, a land flowing with milk and honey.&#8221;&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And they will listen to your voice, and you and the elders of Israel shall go to the king of Egypt and say to him, &#8216;The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us; and now, please let us go a three days&#8217; journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> our God.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless compelled by a mighty hand.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Septuagint, Vulgate; Hebrew go, not by a mighty hand">c</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So I will stretch out my hand and strike Egypt with all the wonders that I will do in it; after that he will let you go.
