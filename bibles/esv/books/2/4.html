<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to him, &#8220;What is that in your hand?&#8221; He said, &#8220;A staff.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;Throw it on the ground.&#8221; So he threw it on the ground, and it became a serpent, and Moses ran from it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;Put out your hand and catch it by the tail&#8221;&#8212;so he put out his hand and caught it, and it became a staff in his hand&#8212;

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Again, the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to him, &#8220;Put your hand inside your cloak.&#8221;<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew into your bosom; also verse 7">a</a></sup></span> And he put his hand inside his cloak, and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Leprosy was a term for several skin diseases; see Leviticus 13">b</a></sup></span> like snow.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then God said, &#8220;Put your hand back inside your cloak.&#8221; So he put his hand back inside his cloak, and when he took it out, behold, it was restored like the rest of his flesh.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8220;If they will not believe you,&#8221; God said, &#8220;or listen to the first sign, they may believe the latter sign.

<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>But Moses said to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, &#8220;Oh, my Lord, I am not eloquent, either in the past or since you have spoken to your servant, but I am slow of speech and of tongue.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to him, &#8220;Who has made man&#8217;s mouth? Who makes him mute, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Is it not I, the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth and teach you what you shall speak.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>But he said, &#8220;Oh, my Lord, please send someone else.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then the anger of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> was kindled against Moses and he said, &#8220;Is there not Aaron, your brother, the Levite? I know that he can speak well. Behold, he is coming out to meet you, and when he sees you, he will be glad in his heart.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>You shall speak to him and put the words in his mouth, and I will be with your mouth and with his mouth and will teach you both what to do.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses in Midian, &#8220;Go back to Egypt, for all the men who were seeking your life are dead.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So Moses took his wife and his sons and had them ride on a donkey, and went back to the land of Egypt. And Moses took the staff of God in his hand.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>So he let him alone. It was then that she said, &#8220;A bridegroom of blood,&#8221; because of the circumcision.</p>
