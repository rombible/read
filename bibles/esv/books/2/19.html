<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Israel at Mount Sinai</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>On the third new moon after the people of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt, on that day they came into the wilderness of Sinai.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>They set out from Rephidim and came into the wilderness of Sinai, and they encamped in the wilderness. There Israel encamped before the mountain,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>while Moses went up to God. The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> called to him out of the mountain, saying, &#8220;Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob, and tell the people of Israel:
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8216;You yourselves have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles&#8217; wings and brought you to myself.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be my treasured possession among all peoples, for all the earth is mine;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.&#8217; These are the words that you shall speak to the people of Israel.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So Moses came and called the elders of the people and set before them all these words that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> had commanded him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>All the people answered together and said, &#8220;All that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has spoken we will do.&#8221; And Moses reported the words of the people to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;Behold, I am coming to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and may also believe you forever.&#8221;</p><p class="regular">When Moses told the words of the people to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>and be ready for the third day. For on the third day the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And you shall set limits for the people all around, saying, &#8216;Take care not to go up into the mountain or touch the edge of it. Whoever touches the mountain shall be put to death.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>No hand shall touch him, but he shall be stoned or shot;<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, shot with an arrow">a</a></sup></span> whether beast or man, he shall not live.&#8217; When the trumpet sounds a long blast, they shall come up to the mountain.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So Moses went down from the mountain to the people and consecrated the people; and they washed their garments.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And he said to the people, &#8220;Be ready for the third day; do not go near a woman.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>On the morning of the third day there were thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud on the mountain and a very loud trumpet blast, so that all the people in the camp trembled.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God, and they took their stand at the foot of the mountain.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Now Mount Sinai was wrapped in smoke because the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> had descended on it in fire. The smoke of it went up like the smoke of a kiln, and the whole mountain trembled greatly.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And as the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him in thunder.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain. And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;Go down and warn the people, lest they break through to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> to look and many of them perish.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Also let the priests who come near to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> consecrate themselves, lest the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> break out against them.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And Moses said to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, &#8220;The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai, for you yourself warned us, saying, &#8216;Set limits around the mountain and consecrate it.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to him, &#8220;Go down, and come up bringing Aaron with you.
