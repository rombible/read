<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Moses and Aaron Before Pharaoh</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron shall be your prophet.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>You shall speak all that I command you, and your brother Aaron shall tell Pharaoh to let the people of Israel go out of his land.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But I will harden Pharaoh&#8217;s heart, and though I multiply my signs and wonders in the land of Egypt,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Pharaoh will not listen to you. Then I will lay my hand on Egypt and bring my hosts, my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great acts of judgment.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>The Egyptians shall know that I am the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, when I stretch out my hand against Egypt and bring out the people of Israel from among them.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Moses and Aaron did so; they did just as the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> commanded them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron eighty-three years old, when they spoke to Pharaoh.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses and Aaron,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;When Pharaoh says to you, &#8216;Prove yourselves by working a miracle,&#8217; then you shall say to Aaron, &#8216;Take your staff and cast it down before Pharaoh, that it may become a serpent.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did just as the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> commanded. Aaron cast down his staff before Pharaoh and his servants, and it became a serpent.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then Pharaoh summoned the wise men and the sorcerers, and they, the magicians of Egypt, also did the same by their secret arts.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>For each man cast down his staff, and they became serpents. But Aaron&#8217;s staff swallowed up their staffs.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Still Pharaoh&#8217;s heart was hardened, and he would not listen to them, as the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> had said.</p>
<p class="heading">The First Plague: Water Turned to Blood</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;Pharaoh&#8217;s heart is hardened; he refuses to let the people go.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Go to Pharaoh in the morning, as he is going out to the water. Stand on the bank of the Nile to meet him, and take in your hand the staff that turned into a serpent.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And you shall say to him, &#8216;The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of the Hebrews, sent me to you, saying, &#8220;Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness.&#8221; But so far, you have not obeyed.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, &#8220;By this you shall know that I am the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>: behold, with the staff that is in my hand I will strike the water that is in the Nile, and it shall turn into blood.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>The fish in the Nile shall die, and the Nile will stink, and the Egyptians will grow weary of drinking water from the Nile.&#8221;&#8217;&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;Say to Aaron, &#8216;Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt, over their rivers, their canals, and their ponds, and all their pools of water, so that they may become blood, and there shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, even in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Moses and Aaron did as the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> commanded. In the sight of Pharaoh and in the sight of his servants he lifted up the staff and struck the water in the Nile, and all the water in the Nile turned into blood.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And the fish in the Nile died, and the Nile stank, so that the Egyptians could not drink water from the Nile. There was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But the magicians of Egypt did the same by their secret arts. So Pharaoh&#8217;s heart remained hardened, and he would not listen to them, as the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> had said.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Pharaoh turned and went into his house, and he did not take even this to heart.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And all the Egyptians dug along the Nile for water to drink, for they could not drink the water of the Nile.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Seven full days passed after the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> had struck the Nile.</p></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
