<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Tell all the congregation of Israel that on the tenth day of this month every man shall take a lamb according to their fathers&#8217; houses, a lamb for a household.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And if the household is too small for a lamb, then he and his nearest neighbor shall take according to the number of persons; according to what each can eat you shall make your count for the lamb.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male a year old. You may take it from the sheep or from the goats,

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And you shall let none of it remain until the morning; anything that remains until the morning you shall burn.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>In this manner you shall eat it: with your belt fastened, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand. And you shall eat it in haste. It is the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s Passover.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>For I will pass through the land of Egypt that night, and I will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and on all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>The blood shall be a sign for you, on the houses where you are. And when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and no plague will befall you to destroy you, when I strike the land of Egypt.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>&#8220;This day shall be for you a memorial day, and you shall keep it as a feast to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>; throughout your generations, as a statute forever, you shall keep it as a feast.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>On the first day you shall hold a holy assembly, and on the seventh day a holy assembly. No work shall be done on those days. But what everyone needs to eat, that alone may be prepared by you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And you shall observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread, for on this very day I brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt. Therefore you shall observe this day, throughout your generations, as a statute forever.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>In the first month, from the fourteenth day of the month at evening, you shall eat unleavened bread until the twenty-first day of the month at evening.

<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then Moses called all the elders of Israel and said to them, &#8220;Go and select lambs for yourselves according to your clans, and kill the Passover lamb.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Take a bunch of hyssop and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and touch the lintel and the two doorposts with the blood that is in the basin. None of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>For the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> will pass through to strike the Egyptians, and when he sees the blood on the lintel and on the two doorposts, the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> will pass over the door and will not allow the destroyer to enter your houses to strike you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>You shall observe this rite as a statute for you and for your sons forever.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And when your children say to you, &#8216;What do you mean by this service?&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>you shall say, &#8216;It is the sacrifice of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s Passover, for he passed over the houses of the people of Israel in Egypt, when he struck the Egyptians but spared our houses.&#8217;&#8221; And the people bowed their heads and worshiped.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then the people of Israel went and did so; as the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> had commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.</p>
<p class="heading">The Tenth Plague: Death of the Firstborn</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>At midnight the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon, and all the firstborn of the livestock.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he and all his servants and all the Egyptians. And there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house where someone was not dead.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Then he summoned Moses and Aaron by night and said, &#8220;Up, go out from among my people, both you and the people of Israel; and go, serve the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, as you have said.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Take your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and be gone, and bless me also!&#8221;</p>
<p class="heading">The Exodus</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>The Egyptians were urgent with the people to send them out of the land in haste. For they said, &#8220;We shall all be dead.&#8221;

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>The people of Israel had also done as Moses told them, for they had asked the Egyptians for silver and gold jewelry and for clothing.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> had given the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have what they asked. Thus they plundered the Egyptians.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>And the people of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides women and children.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>A mixed multitude also went up with them, and very much livestock, both flocks and herds.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough that they had brought out of Egypt, for it was not leavened, because they were thrust out of Egypt and could not wait, nor had they prepared any provisions for themselves.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>The time that the people of Israel lived in Egypt was 430 years.
