<div class="chap"><p class="heading">David Hears of Saul&#8217;s Death</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>After the death of Saul, when David had returned from striking down the Amalekites, David remained two days in Ziklag.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And on the third day, behold, a man came from Saul&#8217;s camp, with his clothes torn and dirt on his head. And when he came to David, he fell to the ground and paid homage.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>David said to him, &#8220;Where do you come from?&#8221; And he said to him, &#8220;I have escaped from the camp of Israel.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And David said to him, &#8220;How did it go? Tell me.&#8221; And he answered, &#8220;The people fled from the battle, and also many of the people have fallen and are dead, and Saul and his son Jonathan are also dead.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then David said to the young man who told him, &#8220;How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And the young man who told him said, &#8220;By chance I happened to be on Mount Gilboa, and there was Saul leaning on his spear, and behold, the chariots and the horsemen were close upon him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. And I answered, &#8216;Here I am.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And he said to me, &#8216;Who are you?&#8217; I answered him, &#8216;I am an Amalekite.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And he said to me, &#8216;Stand beside me and kill me, for anguish has seized me, and yet my life still lingers.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So I stood beside him and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after he had fallen. And I took the crown that was on his head and the armlet that was on his arm, and I have brought them here to my lord.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then David took hold of his clothes and tore them, and so did all the men who were with him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And they mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and for Jonathan his son and for the people of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and for the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And David said to the young man who told him, &#8220;Where do you come from?&#8221; And he answered, &#8220;I am the son of a sojourner, an Amalekite.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>David said to him, &#8220;How is it you were not afraid to put out your hand to destroy the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s anointed?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then David called one of the young men and said, &#8220;Go, execute him.&#8221; And he struck him down so that he died.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And David said to him, &#8220;Your blood be on your head, for your own mouth has testified against you, saying, &#8216;I have killed the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s anointed.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
