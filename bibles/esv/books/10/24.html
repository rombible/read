<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So the king said to Joab, the commander of the army,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Septuagint to Joab and the commanders of the army">a</a></sup></span> who was with him, &#8220;Go through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, and number the people, that I may know the number of the people.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But Joab said to the king, &#8220;May the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God add to the people a hundred times as many as they are, while the eyes of my lord the king still see it, but why does my lord the king delight in this thing?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But the king&#8217;s word prevailed against Joab and the commanders of the army. So Joab and the commanders of the army went out from the presence of the king to number the people of Israel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>They crossed the Jordan and began from Aroer,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Septuagint; Hebrew encamped in Aroer">b</a></sup></span> and from the city that is in the middle of the valley, toward Gad and on to Jazer.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then they came to Gilead, and to Kadesh in the land of the Hittites;<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Septuagint; Hebrew to the land of Tahtim-hodshi">c</a></sup></span> and they came to Dan, and from Dan<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Septuagint; Hebrew they came to Dan-jaan and">d</a></sup></span> they went around to Sidon,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and came to the fortress of Tyre and to all the cities of the Hivites and Canaanites; and they went out to the Negeb of Judah at Beersheba.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And Joab gave the sum of the numbering of the people to the king: in Israel there were 800,000 valiant men who drew the sword, and the men of Judah were 500,000.</p>
<p class="heading">The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s Judgment of David&#8217;s Sin</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>But David&#8217;s heart struck him after he had numbered the people. And David said to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, &#8220;I have sinned greatly in what I have done. But now, O <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, please take away the iniquity of your servant, for I have done very foolishly.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And when David arose in the morning, the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> came to the prophet Gad, David&#8217;s seer, saying,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>&#8220;Go and say to David, &#8216;Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, Three things I offer<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or hold over">e</a></sup></span> you. Choose one of them, that I may do it to you.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So Gad came to David and told him, and said to him, &#8220;Shall three<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Compare 1 Chronicles 21:12, Septuagint; Hebrew seven">f</a></sup></span> years of famine come to you in your land? Or will you flee three months before your foes while they pursue you? Or shall there be three days&#8217; pestilence in your land? Now consider, and decide what answer I shall return to him who sent me.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then David said to Gad, &#8220;I am in great distress. Let us fall into the hand of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, for his mercy is great; but let me not fall into the hand of man.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> sent a pestilence on Israel from the morning until the appointed time. And there died of the people from Dan to Beersheba 70,000 men.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And when the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> relented from the calamity and said to the angel who was working destruction among the people, &#8220;It is enough; now stay your hand.&#8221; And the angel of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then David spoke to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> when he saw the angel who was striking the people, and said, &#8220;Behold, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly. But these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand be against me and against my father&#8217;s house.&#8221;</p>
<p class="heading">David Builds an Altar</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And Gad came that day to David and said to him, &#8220;Go up, raise an altar to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>So David went up at Gad&#8217;s word, as the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> commanded.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And when Araunah looked down, he saw the king and his servants coming on toward him. And Araunah went out and paid homage to the king with his face to the ground.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And Araunah said, &#8220;Why has my lord the king come to his servant?&#8221; David said, &#8220;To buy the threshing floor from you, in order to build an altar to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, that the plague may be averted from the people.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then Araunah said to David, &#8220;Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him. Here are the oxen for the burnt offering and the threshing sledges and the yokes of the oxen for the wood.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>All this, O king, Araunah gives to the king.&#8221; And Araunah said to the king, &#8220;May the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God accept you.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>But the king said to Araunah, &#8220;No, but I will buy it from you for a price. I will not offer burnt offerings to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> my God that cost me nothing.&#8221; So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="A shekel was about 2/5 ounce or 11 grams">g</a></sup></span> of silver.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And David built there an altar to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> responded to the plea for the land, and the plague was averted from Israel.</p><A name="footnotes"></a><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">2</span> Septuagint <i><span class="catch-word">to Joab</span> and the commanders of the army</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">5</span> Septuagint; Hebrew <i>encamped in Aroer</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <span class="fnverse">6</span> Septuagint; Hebrew <i><span class="catch-word">to</span> the land of Tahtim-hodshi</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">d</span> <span class="fnverse">6</span> Septuagint; Hebrew <i><span class="catch-word">they came to</span> Dan-jaan and</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">e</span> <span class="fnverse">12</span> Or <i>hold over</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">f</span> <span class="fnverse">13</span> Compare 1 Chronicles 21:12, Septuagint; Hebrew <i>seven</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">g</span> <span class="fnverse">24</span> A <i class="catch-word-plural">shekel</i> was about 2/5 ounce or 11 grams<br /></span></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
