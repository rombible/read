<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Absalom Returns to Jerusalem</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Now Joab the son of Zeruiah knew that the king&#8217;s heart went out to Absalom.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Joab sent to Tekoa and brought from there a wise woman and said to her, &#8220;Pretend to be a mourner and put on mourning garments. Do not anoint yourself with oil, but behave like a woman who has been mourning many days for the dead.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Go to the king and speak thus to him.&#8221; So Joab put the words in her mouth.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>When the woman of Tekoa came to the king, she fell on her face to the ground and paid homage and said, &#8220;Save me, O king.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And the king said to her, &#8220;What is your trouble?&#8221; She answered, &#8220;Alas, I am a widow; my husband is dead.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And your servant had two sons, and they quarreled with one another in the field. There was no one to separate them, and one struck the other and killed him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And now the whole clan has risen against your servant, and they say, &#8216;Give up the man who struck his brother, that we may put him to death for the life of his brother whom he killed.&#8217; And so they would destroy the heir also. Thus they would quench my coal that is left and leave to my husband neither name nor remnant on the face of the earth.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then the king said to the woman, &#8220;Go to your house, and I will give orders concerning you.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And the woman of Tekoa said to the king, &#8220;On me be the guilt, my lord the king, and on my father&#8217;s house; let the king and his throne be guiltless.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>The king said, &#8220;If anyone says anything to you, bring him to me, and he shall never touch you again.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then she said, &#8220;Please let the king invoke the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God, that the avenger of blood kill no more, and my son be not destroyed.&#8221; He said, &#8220;As the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> lives, not one hair of your son shall fall to the ground.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then the woman said, &#8220;Please let your servant speak a word to my lord the king.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Speak.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And the woman said, &#8220;Why then have you planned such a thing against the people of God? For in giving this decision the king convicts himself, inasmuch as the king does not bring his banished one home again.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>We must all die; we are like water spilled on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again. But God will not take away life, and he devises means so that the banished one will not remain an outcast.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Now I have come to say this to my lord the king because the people have made me afraid, and your servant thought, &#8216;I will speak to the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>For the king will hear and deliver his servant from the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together from the heritage of God.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And your servant thought, &#8216;The word of my lord the king will set me at rest,&#8217; for my lord the king is like the angel of God to discern good and evil. The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God be with you!&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then the king answered the woman, &#8220;Do not hide from me anything I ask you.&#8221; And the woman said, &#8220;Let my lord the king speak.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>The king said, &#8220;Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?&#8221; The woman answered and said, &#8220;As surely as you live, my lord the king, one cannot turn to the right hand or to the left from anything that my lord the king has said. It was your servant Joab who commanded me; it was he who put all these words in the mouth of your servant.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>In order to change the course of things your servant Joab did this. But my lord has wisdom like the wisdom of the angel of God to know all things that are on the earth.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then the king said to Joab, &#8220;Behold now, I grant this; go, bring back the young man Absalom.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And Joab fell on his face to the ground and paid homage and blessed the king. And Joab said, &#8220;Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, my lord the king, in that the king has granted the request of his servant.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>So Joab arose and went to Geshur and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And the king said, &#8220;Let him dwell apart in his own house; he is not to come into my presence.&#8221; So Absalom lived apart in his own house and did not come into the king&#8217;s presence.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Now in all Israel there was no one so much to be praised for his handsome appearance as Absalom. From the sole of his foot to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And when he cut the hair of his head (for at the end of every year he used to cut it; when it was heavy on him, he cut it), he weighed the hair of his head, two hundred shekels<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="A shekel was about 2/5 ounce or 11 grams">a</a></sup></span> by the king&#8217;s weight.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>There were born to Absalom three sons, and one daughter whose name was Tamar. She was a beautiful woman.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>So Absalom lived two full years in Jerusalem, without coming into the king&#8217;s presence.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king, but Joab would not come to him. And he sent a second time, but Joab would not come.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Then he said to his servants, &#8220;See, Joab&#8217;s field is next to mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire.&#8221; So Absalom&#8217;s servants set the field on fire.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Septuagint, Dead Sea Scroll add So Joab's servants came to him with their clothes torn, and they said to him, The servants of Absalom have set your field on fire.">b</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Then Joab arose and went to Absalom at his house and said to him, &#8220;Why have your servants set my field on fire?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Absalom answered Joab, &#8220;Behold, I sent word to you, &#8216;Come here, that I may send you to the king, to ask, &#8220;Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me to be there still.&#8221; Now therefore let me go into the presence of the king, and if there is guilt in me, let him put me to death.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Then Joab went to the king and told him, and he summoned Absalom. So he came to the king and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king, and the king kissed Absalom.</p><A name="footnotes"></a><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">26</span> A <i class="catch-word-plural">shekel</i> was about 2/5 ounce or 11 grams<br /><span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">30</span> Septuagint, Dead Sea Scroll add <i>So Joab's servants came to him with their clothes torn, and they said to him, "The servants of Absalom have set your field on fire."</i><br /></span></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
