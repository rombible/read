<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>the king said to Nathan the prophet, &#8220;See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells in a tent.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And Nathan said to the king, &#8220;Go, do all that is in your heart, for the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> is with you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But that same night the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> came to Nathan,

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>I have not lived in a house since the day I brought up the people of Israel from Egypt to this day, but I have been moving about in a tent for my dwelling.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>In all places where I have moved with all the people of Israel, did I speak a word with any of the judges<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Compare 1 Chronicles 17:6; Hebrew tribes">a</a></sup></span> of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd my people Israel, saying, &#8220;Why have you not built me a house of cedar?&#8221;&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Now, therefore, thus you shall say to my servant David, &#8216;Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts, I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, that you should be prince<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or leader">b</a></sup></span> over my people Israel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And I have been with you wherever you went and have cut off all your enemies from before you. And I will make for you a great name, like the name of the great ones of the earth.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And I will appoint a place for my people Israel and will plant them, so that they may dwell in their own place and be disturbed no more. And violent men shall afflict them no more, as formerly,

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>When your days are fulfilled and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, who shall come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom.
