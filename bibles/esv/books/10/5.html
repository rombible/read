<div class="chap"><p class="heading">David Anointed King of Israel</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and said, &#8220;Behold, we are your bone and flesh.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was you who led out and brought in Israel. And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to you, &#8216;You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be prince<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or leader">a</a></sup></span> over Israel.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and King David made a covenant with them at Hebron before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and they anointed David king over Israel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>At Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and at Jerusalem he reigned over all Israel and Judah thirty-three years.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Dead Sea Scroll lacks verses 4-5">b</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who said to David, &#8220;You will not come in here, but the blind and the lame will ward you off&#8221;&#8212;thinking, &#8220;David cannot come in here.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Nevertheless, David took the stronghold of Zion, that is, the city of David.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And David said on that day, &#8220;Whoever would strike the Jebusites, let him get up the water shaft to attack &#8216;the lame and the blind,&#8217; who are hated by David&#8217;s soul.&#8221; Therefore it is said, &#8220;The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And David lived in the stronghold and called it the city of David. And David built the city all around from the Millo inward.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And David became greater and greater, for the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of hosts, was with him.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, also carpenters and masons who built David a house.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And David knew that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem, after he came from Hebron, and more sons and daughters were born to David.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And these are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,

<p class="heading">David Defeats the Philistines</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to search for David. But David heard of it and went down to the stronghold.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Now the Philistines had come and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And David inquired of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, &#8220;Shall I go up against the Philistines?

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And David came to Baal-perazim, and David defeated them there.
