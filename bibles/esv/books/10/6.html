<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And David arose and went with all the people who were with him from Baale-judah to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the name of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts who sits enthroned on the cherubim.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And they carried the ark of God on a new cart and brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill.

<p class="heading">Uzzah and the Ark</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And David and all the house of Israel were celebrating before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, with songs<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Septuagint, 1 Chronicles 13:8; Hebrew fir trees">c</a></sup></span> and lyres and harps and tambourines and castanets and cymbals.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And when they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah put out his hand to the ark of God and took hold of it, for the oxen stumbled.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And the anger of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> was kindled against Uzzah, and God struck him down there because of his error, and he died there beside the ark of God.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And David was angry because the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> had broken out against Uzzah.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And David was afraid of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> that day, and he said, &#8220;How can the ark of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> come to me?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So David was not willing to take the ark of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> into the city of David. But David took it aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And the ark of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months, and the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> blessed Obed-edom and all his household.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And it was told King David, &#8220;The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has blessed the household of Obed-edom and all that belongs to him, because of the ark of God.&#8221; So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom to the city of David with rejoicing.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And when those who bore the ark of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> had gone six steps, he sacrificed an ox and a fattened animal.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And David danced before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> with all his might. And David was wearing a linen ephod.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> with shouting and with the sound of the horn.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And they brought in the ark of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and set it in its place, inside the tent that David had pitched for it.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And David said to Michal, &#8220;It was before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, who chose me above your father and above all his house, to appoint me as prince<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or leader">f</a></sup></span> over Israel, the people of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>&#8212;and I will celebrate before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.
