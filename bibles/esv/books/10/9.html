<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Now there was a servant of the house of Saul whose name was Ziba, and they called him to David. And the king said to him, &#8220;Are you Ziba?&#8221; And he said, &#8220;I am your servant.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And the king said, &#8220;Is there not still someone of the house of Saul, that I may show the kindness of God to him?&#8221; Ziba said to the king, &#8220;There is still a son of Jonathan; he is crippled in his feet.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>The king said to him, &#8220;Where is he?&#8221; And Ziba said to the king, &#8220;He is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, at Lo-debar.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then King David sent and brought him from the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, at Lo-debar.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan, son of Saul, came to David and fell on his face and paid homage. And David said, &#8220;Mephibosheth!&#8221; And he answered, &#8220;Behold, I am your servant.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And David said to him, &#8220;Do not fear, for I will show you kindness for the sake of your father Jonathan, and I will restore to you all the land of Saul your father, and you shall eat at my table always.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And he paid homage and said, &#8220;What is your servant, that you should show regard for a dead dog such as I?&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then the king called Ziba, Saul&#8217;s servant, and said to him, &#8220;All that belonged to Saul and to all his house I have given to your master&#8217;s grandson.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And you and your sons and your servants shall till the land for him and shall bring in the produce, that your master&#8217;s grandson may have bread to eat. But Mephibosheth your master&#8217;s grandson shall always eat at my table.&#8221; Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then Ziba said to the king, &#8220;According to all that my lord the king commands his servant, so will your servant do.&#8221; So Mephibosheth ate at David&#8217;s<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Septuagint; Hebrew my">a</a></sup></span> table, like one of the king&#8217;s sons.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Mica. And all who lived in Ziba&#8217;s house became Mephibosheth&#8217;s servants.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem, for he ate always at the king&#8217;s table. Now he was lame in both his feet.</p><A name="footnotes"></a><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">11</span> Septuagint; Hebrew <i>my</i><br /></span></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
