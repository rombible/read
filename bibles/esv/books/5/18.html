<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>or a charmer or a medium or a necromancer or one who inquires of the dead,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>for whoever does these things is an abomination to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>for these nations, which you are about to dispossess, listen to fortune-tellers and to diviners. But as for you, the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God has not allowed you to do this.</p>
<p class="heading">A New Prophet like Moses</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>&#8220;The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you, from your brothers&#8212;it is to him you shall listen&#8212;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>just as you desired of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly, when you said, &#8216;Let me not hear again the voice of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> my God or see this great fire any more, lest I die.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to me, &#8216;They are right in what they have spoken.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers. And I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I command him.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And if you say in your heart, &#8216;How may we know the word that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has not spoken?&#8217;&#8212;
