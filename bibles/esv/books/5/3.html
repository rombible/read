And Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>But the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to me, &#8216;Do not fear him, for I have given him and all his people and his land into your hand. And you shall do to him as you did to Sihon the king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> our God gave into our hand Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people, and we struck him down until he had no survivor left.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And we took all his cities at that time&#8212;there was not a city that we did not take from them&#8212;sixty cities, the whole region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars, besides very many unwalled villages.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And we devoted them to destruction,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, set apart (devoted) as an offering to the Lord (for destruction); twice in this verse">a</a></sup></span> as we did to Sihon the king of Heshbon, devoting to destruction every city, men, women, and children.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But all the livestock and the spoil of the cities we took as our plunder.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the Valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>(the Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, while the Amorites call it Senir),
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>all the cities of the tableland and all Gilead and all Bashan, as far as Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>(For only Og the king of Bashan was left of the remnant of the Rephaim. Behold, his bed was a bed of iron. Is it not in Rabbah of the Ammonites? Nine cubits<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="A cubit was about 18 inches or 45 centimeters">b</a></sup></span> was its length, and four cubits its breadth, according to the common cubit.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew cubit of a man">c</a></sup></span>)</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>&#8220;When we took possession of this land at that time, I gave to the Reubenites and the Gadites the territory beginning at Aroer, which is on the edge of the Valley of the Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilead with its cities.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>The rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, that is, all the region of Argob, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh. (All that portion of Bashan is called the land of Rephaim.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Jair the Manassite took all the region of Argob, that is, Bashan, as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called the villages after his own name, Havvoth-jair, as it is to this day.)
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>To Machir I gave Gilead,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>and to the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave the territory from Gilead as far as the Valley of the Arnon, with the middle of the valley as a border, as far over as the river Jabbok, the border of the Ammonites;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>the Arabah also, with the Jordan as the border, from Chinnereth as far as the Sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah on the east.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>&#8220;And I commanded you at that time, saying, &#8216;The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God has given you this land to possess.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Only your wives, your little ones, and your livestock (I know that you have much livestock) shall remain in the cities that I have given you,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>until the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> gives rest to your brothers, as to you, and they also occupy the land that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God gives them beyond the Jordan.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And I commanded Joshua at that time, &#8216;Your eyes have seen all that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God has done to these two kings.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>You shall not fear them, for it is the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God who fights for you.&#8217;</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Please let me go over and see the good land beyond the Jordan, that good hill country and Lebanon.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>But the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> was angry with me because of you and would not listen to me.
