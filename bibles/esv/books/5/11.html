<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And consider today (since I am not speaking to your children who have not known or seen it), consider the discipline<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or instruction">a</a></sup></span> of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God, his greatness, his mighty hand and his outstretched arm,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>his signs and his deeds that he did in Egypt to Pharaoh the king of Egypt and to all his land,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and what he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses and to their chariots, how he made the water of the Red Sea flow over them as they pursued after you, and how the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has destroyed them to this day,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and what he did to you in the wilderness, until you came to this place,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and what he did to Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, son of Reuben, how the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, with their households, their tents, and every living thing that followed them, in the midst of all Israel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For your eyes have seen all the great work of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> that he did.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8220;You shall therefore keep the whole commandment that I command you today, that you may be strong, and go in and take possession of the land that you are going over to possess,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and that you may live long in the land that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> swore to your fathers to give to them and to their offspring, a land flowing with milk and honey.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For the land that you are entering to take possession of it is not like the land of Egypt, from which you have come, where you sowed your seed and irrigated it,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew watered it with your feet">b</a></sup></span> like a garden of vegetables.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But the land that you are going over to possess is a land of hills and valleys, which drinks water by the rain from heaven,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>a land that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God cares for.

<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8220;And if you will indeed obey my commandments that I command you today, to love the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And he will give grass in your fields for your livestock, and you shall eat and be full.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Take care lest your heart be deceived, and you turn aside and serve other gods and worship them;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>then the anger of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> will be kindled against you, and he will shut up the heavens, so that there will be no rain, and the land will yield no fruit, and you will perish quickly off the good land that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> is giving you.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>&#8220;You shall therefore lay up these words of mine in your heart and in your soul, and you shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>You shall teach them to your children, talking of them when you are sitting in your house, and when you are walking by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>that your days and the days of your children may be multiplied in the land that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> swore to your fathers to give them, as long as the heavens are above the earth.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>For if you will be careful to do all this commandment that I command you to do, loving the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God, walking in all his ways, and holding fast to him,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>then the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> will drive out all these nations before you, and you will dispossess nations greater and mightier than you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Every place on which the sole of your foot treads shall be yours.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>No one shall be able to stand against you. The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God will lay the fear of you and the dread of you on all the land that you shall tread, as he promised you.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>&#8220;See, I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse:

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>and the curse, if you do not obey the commandments of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God, but turn aside from the way that I am commanding you today, to go after other gods that you have not known.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And when the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God brings you into the land that you are entering to take possession of it, you shall set the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal.
