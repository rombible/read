<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>you shall set apart three cities for yourselves in the land that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God is giving you to possess.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>You shall measure the distances<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew road">a</a></sup></span> and divide into three parts the area of the land that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God gives you as a possession, so that any manslayer can flee to them.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8220;This is the provision for the manslayer, who by fleeing there may save his life. If anyone kills his neighbor unintentionally without having hated him in the past&#8212;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>as when someone goes into the forest with his neighbor to cut wood, and his hand swings the axe to cut down a tree, and the head slips from the handle and strikes his neighbor so that he dies&#8212;he may flee to one of these cities and live,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>lest the avenger of blood in hot anger pursue the manslayer and overtake him, because the way is long, and strike him fatally, though the man did not deserve to die, since he had not hated his neighbor in the past.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Therefore I command you, You shall set apart three cities.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And if the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God enlarges your territory, as he has sworn to your fathers, and gives you all the land that he promised to give to your fathers&#8212;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>provided you are careful to keep all this commandment, which I command you today, by loving the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God and by walking ever in his ways&#8212;then you shall add three other cities to these three,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>lest innocent blood be shed in your land that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God is giving you for an inheritance, and so the guilt of bloodshed be upon you.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8220;But if anyone hates his neighbor and lies in wait for him and attacks him and strikes him fatally so that he dies, and he flees into one of these cities,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>then the elders of his city shall send and take him from there, and hand him over to the avenger of blood, so that he may die.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Your eye shall not pity him, but you shall purge the guilt of innocent blood<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or the blood of the innocent">b</a></sup></span> from Israel, so that it may be well with you.</p>
<p class="heading">Property Boundaries</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>&#8220;You shall not move your neighbor&#8217;s landmark, which the men of old have set, in the inheritance that you will hold in the land that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God is giving you to possess.</p>
<p class="heading">Laws Concerning Witnesses</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>&#8220;A single witness shall not suffice against a person for any crime or for any wrong in connection with any offense that he has committed.
