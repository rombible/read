<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets that you broke, and you shall put them in the ark.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So I made an ark of acacia wood, and cut two tablets of stone like the first, and went up the mountain with the two tablets in my hand.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And he wrote on the tablets, in the same writing as before, the Ten Commandments<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew the ten words">a</a></sup></span> that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> had spoken to you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly. And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> gave them to me.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then I turned and came down from the mountain and put the tablets in the ark that I had made. And there they are, as the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> commanded me.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>(The people of Israel journeyed from Beeroth Bene-jaakan<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or the wells of the Bene-jaakan">b</a></sup></span> to Moserah. There Aaron died, and there he was buried. And his son Eleazar ministered as priest in his place.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>From there they journeyed to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land with brooks of water.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>At that time the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> to stand before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> to minister to him and to bless in his name, to this day.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Therefore Levi has no portion or inheritance with his brothers. The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> is his inheritance, as the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God said to him.)</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8220;I myself stayed on the mountain, as at the first time, forty days and forty nights, and the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> listened to me that time also.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to me, &#8216;Arise, go on your journey at the head of the people, so that they may go in and possess the land, which I swore to their fathers to give them.&#8217;</p>
