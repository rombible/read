<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>You shall surely destroy all the places where the nations whom you shall dispossess served their gods, on the high mountains and on the hills and under every green tree.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>You shall tear down their altars and dash in pieces their pillars and burn their Asherim with fire. You shall chop down the carved images of their gods and destroy their name out of that place.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>then to the place that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God will choose, to make his name dwell there, there you shall bring all that I command you: your burnt offerings and your sacrifices, your tithes and the contribution that you present, and all your finest vow offerings that you vow to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And you shall rejoice before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God, you and your sons and your daughters, your male servants and your female servants, and the Levite that is within your towns, since he has no portion or inheritance with you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Take care that you do not offer your burnt offerings at any place that you see,
