<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>then your elders and your judges shall come out, and they shall measure the distance to the surrounding cities.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And the elders of the city that is nearest to the slain man shall take a heifer that has never been worked and that has not pulled in a yoke.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And the elders of that city shall bring the heifer down to a valley with running water, which is neither plowed nor sown, and shall break the heifer&#8217;s neck there in the valley.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then the priests, the sons of Levi, shall come forward, for the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God has chosen them to minister to him and to bless in the name of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and by their word every dispute and every assault shall be settled.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And all the elders of that city nearest to the slain man shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and they shall testify, &#8216;Our hands did not shed this blood, nor did our eyes see it shed.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So you shall purge the guilt of innocent blood from your midst, when you do what is right in the sight of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.</p>
