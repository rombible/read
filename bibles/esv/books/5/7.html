<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and when the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God gives them over to you, and you defeat them, then you must devote them to complete destruction.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, set apart (devote) as an offering to the Lord (for destruction)">a</a></sup></span> You shall make no covenant with them and show no mercy to them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>You shall not intermarry with them, giving your daughters to their sons or taking their daughters for your sons,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>for they would turn away your sons from following me, to serve other gods. Then the anger of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> would be kindled against you, and he would destroy you quickly.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But thus shall you deal with them: you shall break down their altars and dash in pieces their pillars and chop down their Asherim and burn their carved images with fire.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>&#8220;For you are a people holy to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God. The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God has chosen you to be a people for his treasured possession, out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>It was not because you were more in number than any other people that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> set his love on you and chose you, for you were the fewest of all peoples,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>but it is because the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> loves you and is keeping the oath that he swore to your fathers, that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you from the house of slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Know therefore that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God is God, the faithful God who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments, to a thousand generations,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and repays to their face those who hate him, by destroying them. He will not be slack with one who hates him. He will repay him to his face.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>You shall therefore be careful to do the commandment and the statutes and the rules that I command you today.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>&#8220;And because you listen to these rules and keep and do them, the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God will keep with you the covenant and the steadfast love that he swore to your fathers.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>He will love you, bless you, and multiply you. He will also bless the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your ground, your grain and your wine and your oil, the increase of your herds and the young of your flock, in the land that he swore to your fathers to give you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>You shall be blessed above all peoples. There shall not be male or female barren among you or among your livestock.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> will take away from you all sickness, and none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which you knew, will he inflict on you, but he will lay them on all who hate you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And you shall consume all the peoples that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God will give over to you.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>you shall not be afraid of them but you shall remember what the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>the great trials that your eyes saw, the signs, the wonders, the mighty hand, and the outstretched arm, by which the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God brought you out.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Moreover, the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God will send hornets among them, until those who are left and hide themselves from you are destroyed.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>You shall not be in dread of them, for the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God is in your midst, a great and awesome God.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God will clear away these nations before you little by little.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>But the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God will give them over to you and throw them into great confusion, until they are destroyed.
