<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Not Because of Righteousness</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>&#8220;Hear, O Israel: you are to cross over the Jordan today, to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than you, cities great and fortified up to heaven,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom you know, and of whom you have heard it said, &#8216;Who can stand before the sons of Anak?&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Know therefore today that he who goes over before you as a consuming fire is the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God. He will destroy them and subdue them before you. So you shall drive them out and make them perish quickly, as the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has promised you.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8220;Do not say in your heart, after the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God has thrust them out before you, &#8216;It is because of my righteousness that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has brought me in to possess this land,&#8217; whereas it is because of the wickedness of these nations that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> is driving them out before you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Not because of your righteousness or the uprightness of your heart are you going in to possess their land, but because of the wickedness of these nations the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God is driving them out from before you, and that he may confirm the word that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>&#8220;Know, therefore, that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God is not giving you this good land to possess because of your righteousness, for you are a stubborn people.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Remember and do not forget how you provoked the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God to wrath in the wilderness. From the day you came out of the land of Egypt until you came to this place, you have been rebellious against the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Even at Horeb you provoked the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> to wrath, and the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> was so angry with you that he was ready to destroy you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>When I went up the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> made with you, I remained on the mountain forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> gave me the two tablets of stone written with the finger of God, and on them were all the words that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> had spoken with you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And at the end of forty days and forty nights the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> gave me the two tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to me, &#8216;Arise, go down quickly from here, for your people whom you have brought from Egypt have acted corruptly. They have turned aside quickly out of the way that I commanded them; they have made themselves a metal image.&#8217;</p>
<p class="heading">The Golden Calf</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8220;Furthermore, the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to me, &#8216;I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stubborn people.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Let me alone, that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven. And I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So I turned and came down from the mountain, and the mountain was burning with fire. And the two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And I looked, and behold, you had sinned against the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God. You had made yourselves a golden<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew cast metal">a</a></sup></span> calf. You had turned aside quickly from the way that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> had commanded you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So I took hold of the two tablets and threw them out of my two hands and broke them before your eyes.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then I lay prostrate before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> as before, forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water, because of all the sin that you had committed, in doing what was evil in the sight of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> to provoke him to anger.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> bore against you, so that he was ready to destroy you. But the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> listened to me that time also.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> was so angry with Aaron that he was ready to destroy him. And I prayed for Aaron also at the same time.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then I took the sinful thing, the calf that you had made, and burned it with fire and crushed it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust. And I threw the dust of it into the brook that ran down from the mountain.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>&#8220;At Taberah also, and at Massah and at Kibroth-hattaavah you provoked the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> to wrath.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And when the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, &#8216;Go up and take possession of the land that I have given you,&#8217; then you rebelled against the commandment of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God and did not believe him or obey his voice.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>You have been rebellious against the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> from the day that I knew you.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>&#8220;So I lay prostrate before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> for these forty days and forty nights, because the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> had said he would destroy you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And I prayed to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, &#8216;O Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span>, do not destroy your people and your heritage, whom you have redeemed through your greatness, whom you have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Do not regard the stubbornness of this people, or their wickedness or their sin,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>lest the land from which you brought us say, &#8220;Because the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> was not able to bring them into the land that he promised them, and because he hated them, he has brought them out to put them to death in the wilderness.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>For they are your people and your heritage, whom you brought out by your great power and by your outstretched arm.&#8217;</p><A name="footnotes"></a><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">16</span> Hebrew <i>cast metal</i><br /></span></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
