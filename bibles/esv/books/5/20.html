<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>for the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God is he who goes with you to fight for you against your enemies, to give you the victory.&#8217;

Let him go back to his house, lest he die in the battle and another man dedicate it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And is there any man who has planted a vineyard and has not enjoyed its fruit? Let him go back to his house, lest he die in the battle and another man enjoy its fruit.
