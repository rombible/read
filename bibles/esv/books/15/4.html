<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>they approached Zerubbabel and the heads of fathers&#8217; houses and said to them, &#8220;Let us build with you, for we worship your God as you do, and we have been sacrificing to him ever since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assyria who brought us here.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of fathers&#8217; houses in Israel said to them, &#8220;You have nothing to do with us in building a house to our God; but we alone will build to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, as King Cyrus the king of Persia has commanded us.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then the people of the land discouraged the people of Judah and made them afraid to build
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and bribed counselors against them to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Now be it known to the king that if this city is rebuilt and the walls finished, they will not pay tribute, custom, or toll, and the royal revenue will be impaired.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/4-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>in order that search may be made in the book of the records of your fathers. You will find in the book of the records and learn that this city is a rebellious city, hurtful to kings and provinces, and that sedition was stirred up in it from of old. That was why this city was laid waste.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/4-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>We make known to the king that if this city is rebuilt and its walls finished, you will then have no possession in the province Beyond the River.&#8221;</p>
