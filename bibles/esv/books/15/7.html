<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For on the first day of the first month he began to go up from Babylonia, and on the first day of the fifth month he came to Jerusalem, for the good hand of his God was on him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For Ezra had set his heart to study the Law of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and to do it and to teach his statutes and rules in Israel.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/7-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>This is a copy of the letter that King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest, the scribe, a man learned in matters of the commandments of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and his statutes for Israel:

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/7-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>I make a decree that anyone of the people of Israel or their priests or Levites in my kingdom, who freely offers to go to Jerusalem, may go with you.
