<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Ezra Prays About Intermarriage</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>After these things had been done, the officials approached me and said, &#8220;The people of Israel and the priests and the Levites have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands with their abominations, from the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>For they have taken some of their daughters to be wives for themselves and for their sons, so that the holy race<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew offspring">a</a></sup></span> has mixed itself with the peoples of the lands. And in this faithlessness the hand of the officials and chief men has been foremost.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>As soon as I heard this, I tore my garment and my cloak and pulled hair from my head and beard and sat appalled.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then all who trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the faithlessness of the returned exiles, gathered around me while I sat appalled until the evening sacrifice.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And at the evening sacrifice I rose from my fasting, with my garment and my cloak torn, and fell upon my knees and spread out my hands to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> my God,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>saying:</p><p class="regular">&#8220;O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift my face to you, my God, for our iniquities have risen higher than our heads, and our guilt has mounted up to the heavens.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>From the days of our fathers to this day we have been in great guilt. And for our iniquities we, our kings, and our priests have been given into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, to plundering, and to utter shame, as it is today.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But now for a brief moment favor has been shown by the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> our God, to leave us a remnant and to give us a secure hold<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew nail, or tent-pin">b</a></sup></span> within his holy place, that our God may brighten our eyes and grant us a little reviving in our slavery.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For we are slaves. Yet our God has not forsaken us in our slavery, but has extended to us his steadfast love before the kings of Persia, to grant us some reviving to set up the house of our God, to repair its ruins, and to give us protection<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew a wall">c</a></sup></span> in Judea and Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8220;And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? For we have forsaken your commandments,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>which you commanded by your servants the prophets, saying, &#8216;The land that you are entering, to take possession of it, is a land impure with the impurity of the peoples of the lands, with their abominations that have filled it from end to end with their uncleanness.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Therefore do not give your daughters to their sons, neither take their daughters for your sons, and never seek their peace or prosperity, that you may be strong and eat the good of the land and leave it for an inheritance to your children forever.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And after all that has come upon us for our evil deeds and for our great guilt, seeing that you, our God, have punished us less than our iniquities deserved and have given us such a remnant as this,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>shall we break your commandments again and intermarry with the peoples who practice these abominations? Would you not be angry with us until you consumed us, so that there should be no remnant, nor any to escape?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>O <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, you are just, for we are left a remnant that has escaped, as it is today. Behold, we are before you in our guilt, for none can stand before you because of this.&#8221;</p><A name="footnotes"></a><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">2</span> Hebrew <i>offspring</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">8</span> Hebrew <i>nail</i>, or <i>tent-pin</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <span class="fnverse">9</span> Hebrew <i>a wall</i><br /></span></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
