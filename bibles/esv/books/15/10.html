<div class="chap"><p class="heading">The People Confess Their Sin</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/10-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>While Ezra prayed and made confession, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, a very great assembly of men, women, and children, gathered to him out of Israel, for the people wept bitterly.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, of the sons of Elam, addressed Ezra: &#8220;We have broken faith with our God and have married foreign women from the peoples of the land, but even now there is hope for Israel in spite of this.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all these wives and their children, according to the counsel of my lord<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or of the Lord">a</a></sup></span> and of those who tremble at the commandment of our God, and let it be done according to the Law.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Arise, for it is your task, and we are with you; be strong and do it.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then Ezra arose and made the leading priests and Levites and all Israel take an oath that they would do as had been said. So they took the oath.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then Ezra withdrew from before the house of God and went to the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib, where he spent the night,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Probable reading; Hebrew where he went">b</a></sup></span> neither eating bread nor drinking water, for he was mourning over the faithlessness of the exiles.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And a proclamation was made throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the returned exiles that they should assemble at Jerusalem,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/10-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>and that if anyone did not come within three days, by order of the officials and the elders all his property should be forfeited, and he himself banned from the congregation of the exiles.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin assembled at Jerusalem within the three days. It was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month. And all the people sat in the open square before the house of God, trembling because of this matter and because of the heavy rain.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, &#8220;You have broken faith and married foreign women, and so increased the guilt of Israel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/10-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now then make confession to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of your fathers and do his will. Separate yourselves from the peoples of the land and from the foreign wives.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/10-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then all the assembly answered with a loud voice, &#8220;It is so; we must do as you have said.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/10-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>But the people are many, and it is a time of heavy rain; we cannot stand in the open. Nor is this a task for one day or for two, for we have greatly transgressed in this matter.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/10-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Let our officials stand for the whole assembly. Let all in our cities who have taken foreign wives come at appointed times, and with them the elders and judges of every city, until the fierce wrath of our God over this matter is turned away from us.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/10-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah opposed this, and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite supported them.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/10-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then the returned exiles did so. Ezra the priest selected men,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Syriac; Hebrew And there were selected Ezra...">c</a></sup></span> heads of fathers&#8217; houses, according to their fathers&#8217; houses, each of them designated by name. On the first day of the tenth month they sat down to examine the matter;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/10-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>and by the first day of the first month they had come to the end of all the men who had married foreign women.</p>
