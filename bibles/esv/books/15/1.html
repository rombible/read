<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Thus says Cyrus king of Persia: The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he has charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Whoever is among you of all his people, may his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and rebuild the house of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel&#8212;he is the God who is in Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And let each survivor, in whatever place he sojourns, be assisted by the men of his place with silver and gold, with goods and with beasts, besides freewill offerings for the house of God that is in Jerusalem.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then rose up the heads of the fathers&#8217; houses of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests and the Levites, everyone whose spirit God had stirred to go up to rebuild the house of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> that is in Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And all who were about them aided them with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, with beasts, and with costly wares, besides all that was freely offered.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Cyrus the king also brought out the vessels of the house of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> that Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from Jerusalem and placed in the house of his gods.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Cyrus king of Persia brought these out in the charge of Mithredath the treasurer, who counted them out to Sheshbazzar the prince of Judah.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And this was the number of them: 30 basins of gold, 1,000 basins of silver, 29 censers,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>30 bowls of gold, 410 bowls of silver, and 1,000 other vessels;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>all the vessels of gold and of silver were 5,400. All these did Sheshbazzar bring up, when the exiles were brought up from Babylonia to Jerusalem.</p></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
