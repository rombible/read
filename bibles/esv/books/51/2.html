<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>I say this in order that no one may delude you with plausible arguments.
