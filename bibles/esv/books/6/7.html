<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Israel Defeated at Ai</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>But the people of Israel broke faith in regard to the devoted things, for Achan the son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of the devoted things. And the anger of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> burned against the people of Israel.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth-aven, east of Bethel, and said to them, &#8220;Go up and spy out the land.&#8221; And the men went up and spied out Ai.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And they returned to Joshua and said to him, &#8220;Do not have all the people go up, but let about two or three thousand men go up and attack Ai. Do not make the whole people toil up there, for they are few.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So about three thousand men went up there from the people. And they fled before the men of Ai,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and the men of Ai killed about thirty-six of their men and chased them before the gate as far as Shebarim and struck them at the descent. And the hearts of the people melted and became as water.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then Joshua tore his clothes and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> until the evening, he and the elders of Israel. And they put dust on their heads.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And Joshua said, &#8220;Alas, O Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span>, why have you brought this people over the Jordan at all, to give us into the hands of the Amorites, to destroy us? Would that we had been content to dwell beyond the Jordan!
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>O Lord, what can I say, when Israel has turned their backs before their enemies!
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it and will surround us and cut off our name from the earth. And what will you do for your great name?&#8221;</p>
<p class="heading">The Sin of Achan</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to Joshua, &#8220;Get up! Why have you fallen on your face?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Israel has sinned; they have transgressed my covenant that I commanded them; they have taken some of the devoted things; they have stolen and lied and put them among their own belongings.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Therefore the people of Israel cannot stand before their enemies. They turn their backs before their enemies, because they have become devoted for destruction.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, set apart (devoted) as an offering to the Lord (for destruction)">a</a></sup></span> I will be with you no more, unless you destroy the devoted things from among you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Get up! Consecrate the people and say, &#8216;Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow; for thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, God of Israel, &#8220;There are devoted things in your midst, O Israel. You cannot stand before your enemies until you take away the devoted things from among you.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>In the morning therefore you shall be brought near by your tribes. And the tribe that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> takes by lot shall come near by clans. And the clan that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> takes shall come near by households. And the household that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> takes shall come near man by man.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And he who is taken with the devoted things shall be burned with fire, he and all that he has, because he has transgressed the covenant of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and because he has done an outrageous thing in Israel.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So Joshua rose early in the morning and brought Israel near tribe by tribe, and the tribe of Judah was taken.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And he brought near the clans of Judah, and the clan of the Zerahites was taken. And he brought near the clan of the Zerahites man by man, and Zabdi was taken.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And he brought near his household man by man, and Achan the son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then Joshua said to Achan, &#8220;My son, give glory to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel and give praise<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or and make confession">b</a></sup></span> to him. And tell me now what you have done; do not hide it from me.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And Achan answered Joshua, &#8220;Truly I have sinned against the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel, and this is what I did:
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>when I saw among the spoil a beautiful cloak from Shinar, and 200 shekels of silver, and a bar of gold weighing 50 shekels,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="A shekel was about 2/5 ounce or 11 grams">c</a></sup></span> then I coveted them and took them. And see, they are hidden in the earth inside my tent, with the silver underneath.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and behold, it was hidden in his tent with the silver underneath.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And they took them out of the tent and brought them to Joshua and to all the people of Israel. And they laid them down before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And Joshua and all Israel with him took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver and the cloak and the bar of gold, and his sons and daughters and his oxen and donkeys and sheep and his tent and all that he had. And they brought them up to the Valley of Achor.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And Joshua said, &#8220;Why did you bring trouble on us? The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> brings trouble on you today.&#8221; And all Israel stoned him with stones. They burned them with fire and stoned them with stones.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And they raised over him a great heap of stones that remains to this day. Then the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> turned from his burning anger. Therefore, to this day the name of that place is called the Valley of Achor.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Achor means trouble">d</a></sup></span></p><A name="footnotes"></a><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">12</span> That is, set apart (<span class="catch-word">devoted</span>) as an offering to the Lord (for destruction)<br /><span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">19</span> Or <i><span class="catch-word">and</span> make confession</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <span class="fnverse">21</span> A <i class="catch-word-plural">shekel</i> was about 2/5 ounce or 11 grams<br /><span class="footnotesbot">d</span> <span class="fnverse">26</span> <i class="catch-word">Achor</i> means <i>trouble</i><br /></span></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
