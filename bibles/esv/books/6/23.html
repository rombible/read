<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Joshua summoned all Israel, its elders and heads, its judges and officers, and said to them, &#8220;I am now old and well advanced in years.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And you have seen all that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God has done to all these nations for your sake, for it is the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God who has fought for you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Behold, I have allotted to you as an inheritance for your tribes those nations that remain, along with all the nations that I have already cut off, from the Jordan to the Great Sea in the west.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God will push them back before you and drive them out of your sight. And you shall possess their land, just as the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God promised you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Therefore, be very strong to keep and to do all that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, turning aside from it neither to the right hand nor to the left,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>that you may not mix with these nations remaining among you or make mention of the names of their gods or swear by them or serve them or bow down to them,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>but you shall cling to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God just as you have done to this day.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has driven out before you great and strong nations. And as for you, no man has been able to stand before you to this day.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>One man of you puts to flight a thousand, since it is the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God who fights for you, just as he promised you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Be very careful, therefore, to love the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>For if you turn back and cling to the remnant of these nations remaining among you and make marriages with them, so that you associate with them and they with you,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>know for certain that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God will no longer drive out these nations before you, but they shall be a snare and a trap for you, a whip on your sides and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from off this good ground that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God has given you.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>&#8220;And now I am about to go the way of all the earth, and you know in your hearts and souls, all of you, that not one word has failed of all the good things<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or words; also twice in verse 15">a</a></sup></span> that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God promised concerning you.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But just as all the good things that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God promised concerning you have been fulfilled for you, so the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> will bring upon you all the evil things, until he has destroyed you from off this good land that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God has given you,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>if you transgress the covenant of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God, which he commanded you, and go and serve other gods and bow down to them.
