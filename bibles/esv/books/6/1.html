<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Moses my servant is dead. Now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, you and all this people, into the land that I am giving to them, to the people of Israel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Every place that the sole of your foot will tread upon I have given to you, just as I promised to Moses.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>From the wilderness and this Lebanon as far as the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites to the Great Sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your territory.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Only be strong and very courageous, being careful to do according to all the law that Moses my servant commanded you.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8220;Remember the word that Moses the servant of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> commanded you, saying, &#8216;The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God is providing you a place of rest and will give you this land.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Your wives, your little ones, and your livestock shall remain in the land that Moses gave you beyond the Jordan, but all the men of valor among you shall pass over armed before your brothers and shall help them,
