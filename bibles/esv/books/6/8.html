<div class="chap"><p class="heading">The Fall of Ai</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to Joshua, &#8220;Do not fear and do not be dismayed. Take all the fighting men with you, and arise, go up to Ai. See, I have given into your hand the king of Ai, and his people, his city, and his land.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And you shall do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king. Only its spoil and its livestock you shall take as plunder for yourselves. Lay an ambush against the city, behind it.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So Joshua and all the fighting men arose to go up to Ai. And Joshua chose 30,000 mighty men of valor and sent them out by night.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And he commanded them, &#8220;Behold, you shall lie in ambush against the city, behind it. Do not go very far from the city, but all of you remain ready.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And I and all the people who are with me will approach the city. And when they come out against us just as before, we shall flee before them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And they will come out after us, until we have drawn them away from the city. For they will say, &#8216;They are fleeing from us, just as before.&#8217; So we will flee before them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then you shall rise up from the ambush and seize the city, for the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God will give it into your hand.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And as soon as you have taken the city, you shall set the city on fire. You shall do according to the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. See, I have commanded you.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So Joshua sent them out. And they went to the place of ambush and lay between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai, but Joshua spent that night among the people.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Joshua arose early in the morning and mustered the people and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And all the fighting men who were with him went up and drew near before the city and encamped on the north side of Ai, with a ravine between them and Ai.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>He took about 5,000 men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of the city.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So they stationed the forces, the main encampment that was north of the city and its rear guard west of the city. But Joshua spent that night in the valley.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And as soon as the king of Ai saw this, he and all his people, the men of the city, hurried and went out early to the appointed place<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew appointed time">a</a></sup></span> toward the Arabah to meet Israel in battle. But he did not know that there was an ambush against him behind the city.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And Joshua and all Israel pretended to be beaten before them and fled in the direction of the wilderness.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So all the people who were in the city were called together to pursue them, and as they pursued Joshua they were drawn away from the city.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Not a man was left in Ai or Bethel who did not go out after Israel. They left the city open and pursued Israel.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to Joshua, &#8220;Stretch out the javelin that is in your hand toward Ai, for I will give it into your hand.&#8221; And Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And the men in the ambush rose quickly out of their place, and as soon as he had stretched out his hand, they ran and entered the city and captured it. And they hurried to set the city on fire.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So when the men of Ai looked back, behold, the smoke of the city went up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that, for the people who fled to the wilderness turned back against the pursuers.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had captured the city, and that the smoke of the city went up, then they turned back and struck down the men of Ai.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And the others came out from the city against them, so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side. And Israel struck them down, until there was left none that survived or escaped.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>But the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him near to Joshua.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>When Israel had finished killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the open wilderness where they pursued them, and all of them to the very last had fallen by the edge of the sword, all Israel returned to Ai and struck it down with the edge of the sword.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And all who fell that day, both men and women, were 12,000, all the people of Ai.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>But Joshua did not draw back his hand with which he stretched out the javelin until he had devoted all the inhabitants of Ai to destruction.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, set apart (devoted) as an offering to the Lord (for destruction)">b</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Only the livestock and the spoil of that city Israel took as their plunder, according to the word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> that he commanded Joshua.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>So Joshua burned Ai and made it forever a heap of ruins, as it is to this day.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And he hanged the king of Ai on a tree until evening. And at sunset Joshua commanded, and they took his body down from the tree and threw it at the entrance of the gate of the city and raised over it a great heap of stones, which stands there to this day.</p>
<p class="heading">Joshua Renews the Covenant</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>At that time Joshua built an altar to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, on Mount Ebal,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>just as Moses the servant of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> had commanded the people of Israel, as it is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, &#8220;an altar of uncut stones, upon which no man has wielded an iron tool.&#8221; And they offered on it burnt offerings to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and sacrificed peace offerings.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And there, in the presence of the people of Israel, he wrote on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he had written.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And all Israel, sojourner as well as native born, with their elders and officers and their judges, stood on opposite sides of the ark before the Levitical priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, half of them in front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, just as Moses the servant of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> had commanded at the first, to bless the people of Israel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the Book of the Law.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/8-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>There was not a word of all that Moses commanded that Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel, and the women, and the little ones, and the sojourners who lived<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or traveled">c</a></sup></span> among them.</p><A name="footnotes"></a><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">14</span> Hebrew <i><span class="catch-word">appointed</span> time</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">26</span> That is, set apart (<span class="catch-word">devoted</span>) as an offering to the Lord (for destruction)<br /><span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <span class="fnverse">35</span> Or <i>traveled</i><br /></span></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
