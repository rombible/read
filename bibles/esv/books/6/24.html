<div class="chap"><p class="heading">The Covenant Renewal at Shechem</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem and summoned the elders, the heads, the judges, and the officers of Israel. And they presented themselves before God.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Joshua said to all the people, &#8220;Thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, &#8216;Long ago, your fathers lived beyond the Euphrates,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew the River">a</a></sup></span> Terah, the father of Abraham and of Nahor; and they served other gods.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then I took your father Abraham from beyond the River<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, the Euphrates; also verses 14, 15">b</a></sup></span> and led him through all the land of Canaan, and made his offspring many. I gave him Isaac.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. And I gave Esau the hill country of Seir to possess, but Jacob and his children went down to Egypt.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt with what I did in the midst of it, and afterward I brought you out.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>&#8220;&#8216;Then I brought your fathers out of Egypt, and you came to the sea. And the Egyptians pursued your fathers with chariots and horsemen to the Red Sea.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And when they cried to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians and made the sea come upon them and cover them; and your eyes saw what I did in Egypt. And you lived in the wilderness a long time.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then I brought you to the land of the Amorites, who lived on the other side of the Jordan. They fought with you, and I gave them into your hand, and you took possession of their land, and I destroyed them before you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel. And he sent and invited Balaam the son of Beor to curse you,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>but I would not listen to Balaam. Indeed, he blessed you. So I delivered you out of his hand.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And you went over the Jordan and came to Jericho, and the leaders of Jericho fought against you, and also the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. And I gave them into your hand.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out before you, the two kings of the Amorites; it was not by your sword or by your bow.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>I gave you a land on which you had not labored and cities that you had not built, and you dwell in them. You eat the fruit of vineyards and olive orchards that you did not plant.&#8217;</p>
<p class="heading">Choose Whom You Will Serve</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>&#8220;Now therefore fear the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and serve him in sincerity and in faithfulness. Put away the gods that your fathers served beyond the River and in Egypt, and serve the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And if it is evil in your eyes to serve the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, choose this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your fathers served in the region beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell. But as for me and my house, we will serve the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then the people answered, &#8220;Far be it from us that we should forsake the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> to serve other gods,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>for it is the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> our God who brought us and our fathers up from the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, and who did those great signs in our sight and preserved us in all the way that we went, and among all the peoples through whom we passed.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> drove out before us all the peoples, the Amorites who lived in the land. Therefore we also will serve the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, for he is our God.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>But Joshua said to the people, &#8220;You are not able to serve the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, for he is a holy God. He is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions or your sins.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>If you forsake the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and serve foreign gods, then he will turn and do you harm and consume you, after having done you good.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And the people said to Joshua, &#8220;No, but we will serve the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then Joshua said to the people, &#8220;You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, to serve him.&#8221; And they said, &#8220;We are witnesses.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>He said, &#8220;Then put away the foreign gods that are among you, and incline your heart to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And the people said to Joshua, &#8220;The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> our God we will serve, and his voice we will obey.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and put in place statutes and rules for them at Shechem.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And Joshua wrote these words in the Book of the Law of God. And he took a large stone and set it up there under the terebinth that was by the sanctuary of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And Joshua said to all the people, &#8220;Behold, this stone shall be a witness against us, for it has heard all the words of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> that he spoke to us. Therefore it shall be a witness against you, lest you deal falsely with your God.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>So Joshua sent the people away, every man to his inheritance.</p>
