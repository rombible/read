To Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, were allotted Gilead and Bashan, because he was a man of war.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/17-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And allotments were made to the rest of the people of Manasseh by their clans, Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher, and Shemida. These were the male descendants of Manasseh the son of Joseph, by their clans.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/17-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Now Zelophehad the son of Hepher, son of Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasseh, had no sons, but only daughters, and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/17-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>They approached Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and the leaders and said, &#8220;The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> commanded Moses to give us an inheritance along with our brothers.&#8221; So according to the mouth of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> he gave them an inheritance among the brothers of their father.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/17-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Thus there fell to Manasseh ten portions, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is on the other side of the Jordan,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/17-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>because the daughters of Manasseh received an inheritance along with his sons. The land of Gilead was allotted to the rest of the people of Manasseh.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/17-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>The territory of Manasseh reached from Asher to Michmethath, which is east of Shechem. Then the boundary goes along southward to the inhabitants of En-tappuah.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/17-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh, but the town of Tappuah on the boundary of Manasseh belonged to the people of Ephraim.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/17-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then the boundary went down to the brook Kanah. These cities, to the south of the brook, among the cities of Manasseh, belong to Ephraim. Then the boundary of Manasseh goes on the north side of the brook and ends at the sea,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/17-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>the land to the south being Ephraim&#8217;s and that to the north being Manasseh&#8217;s, with the sea forming its boundary. On the north Asher is reached, and on the east Issachar.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/17-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Also in Issachar and in Asher Manasseh had Beth-shean and its villages, and Ibleam and its villages, and the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, and the inhabitants of En-dor and its villages, and the inhabitants of Taanach and its villages, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages; the third is Naphath.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain">a</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/17-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Yet the people of Manasseh could not take possession of those cities, but the Canaanites persisted in dwelling in that land.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/17-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Now when the people of Israel grew strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but did not utterly drive them out.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/17-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then the people of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, &#8220;Why have you given me but one lot and one portion as an inheritance, although I am a numerous people, since all along the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has blessed me?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/17-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And Joshua said to them, &#8220;If you are a numerous people, go up by yourselves to the forest, and there clear ground for yourselves in the land of the Perizzites and the Rephaim, since the hill country of Ephraim is too narrow for you.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/17-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>The people of Joseph said, &#8220;The hill country is not enough for us.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/17-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then Joshua said to the house of Joseph, to Ephraim and Manasseh, &#8220;You are a numerous people and have great power. You shall not have one allotment only,
