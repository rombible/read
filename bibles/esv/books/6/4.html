<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Take twelve men from the people, from each tribe a man,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and command them, saying, &#8216;Take twelve stones from here out of the midst of the Jordan, from the very place where the priests&#8217; feet stood firmly, and bring them over with you and lay them down in the place where you lodge tonight.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then Joshua called the twelve men from the people of Israel, whom he had appointed, a man from each tribe.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And Joshua said to them, &#8220;Pass on before the ark of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God into the midst of the Jordan, and take up each of you a stone upon his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the people of Israel,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>that this may be a sign among you. When your children ask in time to come, &#8216;What do those stones mean to you?&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>then you shall tell them that the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. When it passed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. So these stones shall be to the people of Israel a memorial forever.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And the people of Israel did just as Joshua commanded and took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, according to the number of the tribes of the people of Israel, just as the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> told Joshua. And they carried them over with them to the place where they lodged and laid them down<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or to rest">a</a></sup></span> there.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And Joshua set up<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or Joshua had set up">b</a></sup></span> twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests bearing the ark of the covenant had stood; and they are there to this day.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For the priests bearing the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan until everything was finished that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> commanded Joshua to tell the people, according to all that Moses had commanded Joshua.</p><p class="regular">The people passed over in haste.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And when all the people had finished passing over, the ark of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and the priests passed over before the people.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>The sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh passed over armed before the people of Israel, as Moses had told them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>About 40,000 ready for war passed over before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> for battle, to the plains of Jericho.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>On that day the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel, and they stood in awe of him just as they had stood in awe of Moses, all the days of his life.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to Joshua,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>&#8220;Command the priests bearing the ark of the testimony to come up out of the Jordan.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So Joshua commanded the priests, &#8220;Come up out of the Jordan.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And when the priests bearing the ark of the covenant of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> came up from the midst of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests&#8217; feet were lifted up on dry ground, the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and overflowed all its banks, as before.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>The people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and they encamped at Gilgal on the east border of Jericho.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And those twelve stones, which they took out of the Jordan, Joshua set up at Gilgal.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And he said to the people of Israel, &#8220;When your children ask their fathers in times to come, &#8216;What do these stones mean?&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>then you shall let your children know, &#8216;Israel passed over this Jordan on dry ground.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>For the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God dried up the waters of the Jordan for you until you passed over, as the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God did to the Red Sea, which he dried up for us until we passed over,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the hand of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> is mighty, that you may fear the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God forever.&#8221;<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or all the days">c</a></sup></span></p><A name="footnotes"></a><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">8</span> Or <i>to rest</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">9</span> Or <i><span class="catch-word">Joshua</span> had set up</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <span class="fnverse">24</span> Or <i>all the days</i><br /></span></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
