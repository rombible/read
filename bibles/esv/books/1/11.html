<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And they said to one another, &#8220;Come, let us make bricks, and burn them thoroughly.&#8221; And they had brick for stone, and bitumen for mortar.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then they said, &#8220;Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be dispersed over the face of the whole earth.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of man had built.
