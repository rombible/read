<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>the sons of God saw that the daughters of man were attractive. And they took as their wives any they chose.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said, &#8220;My Spirit shall not abide in<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or My Spirit shall not contend with">a</a></sup></span> man forever, for he is flesh: his days shall be 120 years.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>The Nephilim<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or giants">b</a></sup></span> were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of man and they bore children to them. These were the mighty men who were of old, the men of renown.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> regretted that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said, &#8220;I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens, for I am sorry that I have made them.&#8221;

<p class="heading">Noah and the Flood</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generation. Noah walked with God.
