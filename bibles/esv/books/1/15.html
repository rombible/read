<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/15-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>But Abram said, &#8220;O Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span>, what will you give me, for I continue<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or I shall die">a</a></sup></span> childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/15-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And Abram said, &#8220;Behold, you have given me no offspring, and a member of my household will be my heir.&#8221;

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/15-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And he brought him outside and said, &#8220;Look toward heaven, and number the stars, if you are able to number them.&#8221; Then he said to him, &#8220;So shall your offspring be.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/15-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And he believed the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and he counted it to him as righteousness.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/15-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But he said, &#8220;O Lord <span class="divine-name">God</span>, how am I to know that I shall possess it?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/15-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>He said to him, &#8220;Bring me a heifer three years old, a female goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.&#8221;
