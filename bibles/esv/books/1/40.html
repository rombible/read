<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Joseph Interprets Two Prisoners&#8217; Dreams</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Some time after this, the cupbearer of the king of Egypt and his baker committed an offense against their lord the king of Egypt.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the prison where Joseph was confined.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>The captain of the guard appointed Joseph to be with them, and he attended them. They continued for some time in custody.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And one night they both dreamed&#8212;the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison&#8212;each his own dream, and each dream with its own interpretation.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>When Joseph came to them in the morning, he saw that they were troubled.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So he asked Pharaoh&#8217;s officers who were with him in custody in his master&#8217;s house, &#8220;Why are your faces downcast today?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>They said to him, &#8220;We have had dreams, and there is no one to interpret them.&#8221; And Joseph said to them, &#8220;Do not interpretations belong to God? Please tell them to me.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph and said to him, &#8220;In my dream there was a vine before me,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and on the vine there were three branches. As soon as it budded, its blossoms shot forth, and the clusters ripened into grapes.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Pharaoh&#8217;s cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh&#8217;s cup and placed the cup in Pharaoh&#8217;s hand.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then Joseph said to him, &#8220;This is its interpretation: the three branches are three days.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>In three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your office, and you shall place Pharaoh&#8217;s cup in his hand as formerly, when you were his cupbearer.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Only remember me, when it is well with you, and please do me the kindness to mention me to Pharaoh, and so get me out of this house.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>For I was indeed stolen out of the land of the Hebrews, and here also I have done nothing that they should put me into the pit.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was favorable, he said to Joseph, &#8220;I also had a dream: there were three cake baskets on my head,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>and in the uppermost basket there were all sorts of baked food for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating it out of the basket on my head.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And Joseph answered and said, &#8220;This is its interpretation: the three baskets are three days.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>In three days Pharaoh will lift up your head&#8212;from you!&#8212;and hang you on a tree. And the birds will eat the flesh from you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>On the third day, which was Pharaoh&#8217;s birthday, he made a feast for all his servants and lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker among his servants.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>He restored the chief cupbearer to his position, and he placed the cup in Pharaoh&#8217;s hand.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Yet the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph, but forgot him.</p></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
