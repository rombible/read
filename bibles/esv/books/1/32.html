<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Jacob Fears Esau</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And when Jacob saw them he said, &#8220;This is God&#8217;s camp!&#8221; So he called the name of that place Mahanaim.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Mahanaim means two camps">a</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And Jacob sent<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or had sent">b</a></sup></span> messengers before him to Esau his brother in the land of Seir, the country of Edom,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>instructing them, &#8220;Thus you shall say to my lord Esau: Thus says your servant Jacob, &#8216;I have sojourned with Laban and stayed until now.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, male servants, and female servants. I have sent to tell my lord, in order that I may find favor in your sight.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, &#8220;We came to your brother Esau, and he is coming to meet you, and there are four hundred men with him.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed. He divided the people who were with him, and the flocks and herds and camels, into two camps,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>thinking, &#8220;If Esau comes to the one camp and attacks it, then the camp that is left will escape.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And Jacob said, &#8220;O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, O <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> who said to me, &#8216;Return to your country and to your kindred, that I may do you good,&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>I am not worthy of the least of all the deeds of steadfast love and all the faithfulness that you have shown to your servant, for with only my staff I crossed this Jordan, and now I have become two camps.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Please deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I fear him, that he may come and attack me, the mothers with the children.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But you said, &#8216;I will surely do you good, and make your offspring as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So he stayed there that night, and from what he had with him he took a present for his brother Esau,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>thirty milking camels and their calves, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>These he handed over to his servants, every drove by itself, and said to his servants, &#8220;Pass on ahead of me and put a space between drove and drove.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>He instructed the first, &#8220;When Esau my brother meets you and asks you, &#8216;To whom do you belong? Where are you going? And whose are these ahead of you?&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>then you shall say, &#8216;They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a present sent to my lord Esau. And moreover, he is behind us.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>He likewise instructed the second and the third and all who followed the droves, &#8220;You shall say the same thing to Esau when you find him,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>and you shall say, &#8216;Moreover, your servant Jacob is behind us.&#8217;&#8221; For he thought, &#8220;I may appease him<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew appease his face">c</a></sup></span> with the present that goes ahead of me, and afterward I shall see his face. Perhaps he will accept me.&#8221;<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew he will lift my face">d</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>So the present passed on ahead of him, and he himself stayed that night in the camp.</p>
<p class="heading">Jacob Wrestles with God</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>The same night he arose and took his two wives, his two female servants, and his eleven children,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or sons">e</a></sup></span> and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>He took them and sent them across the stream, and everything else that he had.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And Jacob was left alone. And a man wrestled with him until the breaking of the day.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>When the man saw that he did not prevail against Jacob, he touched his hip socket, and Jacob&#8217;s hip was put out of joint as he wrestled with him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Then he said, &#8220;Let me go, for the day has broken.&#8221; But Jacob said, &#8220;I will not let you go unless you bless me.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And he said to him, &#8220;What is your name?&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Jacob.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then he said, &#8220;Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Israel means He strives with God, or God strives">f</a></sup></span> for you have striven with God and with men, and have prevailed.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Then Jacob asked him, &#8220;Please tell me your name.&#8221; But he said, &#8220;Why is it that you ask my name?&#8221; And there he blessed him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>So Jacob called the name of the place Peniel,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Peniel means the face of God">g</a></sup></span> saying, &#8220;For I have seen God face to face, and yet my life has been delivered.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>The sun rose upon him as he passed Penuel, limping because of his hip.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Therefore to this day the people of Israel do not eat the sinew of the thigh that is on the hip socket, because he touched the socket of Jacob&#8217;s hip on the sinew of the thigh.</p><A name="footnotes"></a><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">2</span> <i class="catch-word">Mahanaim</i> means <i>two camps</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">3</span> Or <i>had sent</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <span class="fnverse">20</span> Hebrew <i><span class="catch-word">appease</span> his face</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">d</span> <span class="fnverse">20</span> Hebrew <i><span class="catch-word">he will</span> lift my face</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">e</span> <span class="fnverse">22</span> Or <i>sons</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">f</span> <span class="fnverse">28</span> <i class="catch-word">Israel</i> means <i>He strives with God</i>, or <i>God strives</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">g</span> <span class="fnverse">30</span> <i class="catch-word">Peniel</i> means <i>the face of God</i><br /></span></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
