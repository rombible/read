<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Jacob&#8217;s anger was kindled against Rachel, and he said, &#8220;Am I in the place of God, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then she said, &#8220;Here is my servant Bilhah; go in to her, so that she may give birth on my behalf,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew on my knees">a</a></sup></span> that even I may have children<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew be built up, which sounds like the Hebrew for children">b</a></sup></span> through her.&#8221;

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But she said to her, &#8220;Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband?

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, that I may go, for you know the service that I have given you.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>But Laban said to him, &#8220;If I have found favor in your sight, I have learned by divination that<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or have become rich and">k</a></sup></span> the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has blessed me because of you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Name your wages, and I will give it.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Jacob said to him, &#8220;You yourself know how I have served you, and how your livestock has fared with me.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>For you had little before I came, and it has increased abundantly, and the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has blessed you wherever I turned. But now when shall I provide for my own household also?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>He said, &#8220;What shall I give you?&#8221; Jacob said, &#8220;You shall not give me anything. If you will do this for me, I will again pasture your flock and keep it:
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>let me pass through all your flock today, removing from it every speckled and spotted sheep and every black lamb, and the spotted and speckled among the goats, and they shall be my wages.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>So my honesty will answer for me later, when you come to look into my wages with you. Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and black among the lambs, if found with me, shall be counted stolen.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Laban said, &#8220;Good! Let it be as you have said.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>But that day Laban removed the male goats that were striped and spotted, and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white on it, and every lamb that was black, and put them in the charge of his sons.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>And he set a distance of three days&#8217; journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob pastured the rest of Laban&#8217;s flock.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>Then Jacob took fresh sticks of poplar and almond and plane trees, and peeled white streaks in them, exposing the white of the sticks.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>He set the sticks that he had peeled in front of the flocks in the troughs, that is, the watering places, where the flocks came to drink. And since they bred when they came to drink,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>the flocks bred in front of the sticks and so the flocks brought forth striped, speckled, and spotted.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>And Jacob separated the lambs and set the faces of the flocks toward the striped and all the black in the flock of Laban. He put his own droves apart and did not put them with Laban&#8217;s flock.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>Whenever the stronger of the flock were breeding, Jacob would lay the sticks in the troughs before the eyes of the flock, that they might breed among the sticks,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>but for the feebler of the flock he would not lay them there. So the feebler would be Laban&#8217;s, and the stronger Jacob&#8217;s.
