<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Abraham and Abimelech</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/20-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>From there Abraham journeyed toward the territory of the Negeb and lived between Kadesh and Shur; and he sojourned in Gerar.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/20-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, &#8220;She is my sister.&#8221; And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/20-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night and said to him, &#8220;Behold, you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken, for she is a man&#8217;s wife.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/20-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Now Abimelech had not approached her. So he said, &#8220;Lord, will you kill an innocent people?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/20-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Did he not himself say to me, &#8216;She is my sister&#8217;? And she herself said, &#8216;He is my brother.&#8217; In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands I have done this.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/20-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then God said to him in the dream, &#8220;Yes, I know that you have done this in the integrity of your heart, and it was I who kept you from sinning against me. Therefore I did not let you touch her.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/20-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now then, return the man&#8217;s wife, for he is a prophet, so that he will pray for you, and you shall live. But if you do not return her, know that you shall surely die, you and all who are yours.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/20-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So Abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his servants and told them all these things. And the men were very much afraid.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/20-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, &#8220;What have you done to us? And how have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and my kingdom a great sin? You have done to me things that ought not to be done.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/20-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And Abimelech said to Abraham, &#8220;What did you see, that you did this thing?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/20-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Abraham said, &#8220;I did it because I thought, &#8216;There is no fear of God at all in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/20-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father though not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/20-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And when God caused me to wander from my father&#8217;s house, I said to her, &#8216;This is the kindness you must do me: at every place to which we come, say of me, &#8220;He is my brother.&#8221;&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/20-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and male servants and female servants, and gave them to Abraham, and returned Sarah his wife to him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/20-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And Abimelech said, &#8220;Behold, my land is before you; dwell where it pleases you.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/20-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>To Sarah he said, &#8220;Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/20-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, and also healed his wife and female slaves so that they bore children.
