<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Jacob Flees from Laban</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Now Jacob heard that the sons of Laban were saying, &#8220;Jacob has taken all that was our father&#8217;s, and from what was our father&#8217;s he has gained all this wealth.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Jacob saw that Laban did not regard him with favor as before.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to Jacob, &#8220;Return to the land of your fathers and to your kindred, and I will be with you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah into the field where his flock was
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and said to them, &#8220;I see that your father does not regard me with favor as he did before. But the God of my father has been with me.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>You know that I have served your father with all my strength,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>yet your father has cheated me and changed my wages ten times. But God did not permit him to harm me.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>If he said, &#8216;The spotted shall be your wages,&#8217; then all the flock bore spotted; and if he said, &#8216;The striped shall be your wages,&#8217; then all the flock bore striped.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Thus God has taken away the livestock of your father and given them to me.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>In the breeding season of the flock I lifted up my eyes and saw in a dream that the goats that mated with the flock were striped, spotted, and mottled.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then the angel of God said to me in the dream, &#8216;Jacob,&#8217; and I said, &#8216;Here I am!&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And he said, &#8216;Lift up your eyes and see, all the goats that mate with the flock are striped, spotted, and mottled, for I have seen all that Laban is doing to you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar and made a vow to me. Now arise, go out from this land and return to the land of your kindred.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then Rachel and Leah answered and said to him, &#8220;Is there any portion or inheritance left to us in our father&#8217;s house?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Are we not regarded by him as foreigners? For he has sold us, and he has indeed devoured our money.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>All the wealth that God has taken away from our father belongs to us and to our children. Now then, whatever God has said to you, do.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So Jacob arose and set his sons and his wives on camels.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>He drove away all his livestock, all his property that he had gained, the livestock in his possession that he had acquired in Paddan-aram, to go to the land of Canaan to his father Isaac.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Laban had gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel stole her father&#8217;s household gods.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And Jacob tricked<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew stole the heart of; also verses 26, 27">a</a></sup></span> Laban the Aramean, by not telling him that he intended to flee.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>He fled with all that he had and arose and crossed the Euphrates,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew the River">b</a></sup></span> and set his face toward the hill country of Gilead.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>When it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>he took his kinsmen with him and pursued him for seven days and followed close after him into the hill country of Gilead.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>But God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream by night and said to him, &#8220;Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country, and Laban with his kinsmen pitched tents in the hill country of Gilead.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And Laban said to Jacob, &#8220;What have you done, that you have tricked me and driven away my daughters like captives of the sword?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Why did you flee secretly and trick me, and did not tell me, so that I might have sent you away with mirth and songs, with tambourine and lyre?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And why did you not permit me to kiss my sons and my daughters farewell? Now you have done foolishly.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>It is in my power to do you harm. But the God of your<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="The Hebrew for your is plural here">c</a></sup></span> father spoke to me last night, saying, &#8216;Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And now you have gone away because you longed greatly for your father&#8217;s house, but why did you steal my gods?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Jacob answered and said to Laban, &#8220;Because I was afraid, for I thought that you would take your daughters from me by force.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Anyone with whom you find your gods shall not live. In the presence of our kinsmen point out what I have that is yours, and take it.&#8221; Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>So Laban went into Jacob&#8217;s tent and into Leah&#8217;s tent and into the tent of the two female servants, but he did not find them. And he went out of Leah&#8217;s tent and entered Rachel&#8217;s.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Now Rachel had taken the household gods and put them in the camel&#8217;s saddle and sat on them. Laban felt all about the tent, but did not find them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>And she said to her father, &#8220;Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise before you, for the way of women is upon me.&#8221; So he searched but did not find the household gods.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Then Jacob became angry and berated Laban. Jacob said to Laban, &#8220;What is my offense? What is my sin, that you have hotly pursued me?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>For you have felt through all my goods; what have you found of all your household goods? Set it here before my kinsmen and your kinsmen, that they may decide between us two.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>These twenty years I have been with you. Your ewes and your female goats have not miscarried, and I have not eaten the rams of your flocks.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>What was torn by wild beasts I did not bring to you. I bore the loss of it myself. From my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>There I was: by day the heat consumed me, and the cold by night, and my sleep fled from my eyes.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>These twenty years I have been in your house. I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been on my side, surely now you would have sent me away empty-handed. God saw my affliction and the labor of my hands and rebuked you last night.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>Then Laban answered and said to Jacob, &#8220;The daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine. But what can I do this day for these my daughters or for their children whom they have borne?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>Come now, let us make a covenant, you and I. And let it be a witness between you and me.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span>And Jacob said to his kinsmen, &#8220;Gather stones.&#8221; And they took stones and made a heap, and they ate there by the heap.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-47.htm"><b>47</b></a></span>Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Aramaic the heap of witness">d</a></sup></span> but Jacob called it Galeed.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew the heap of witness">e</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-48.htm"><b>48</b></a></span>Laban said, &#8220;This heap is a witness between you and me today.&#8221; Therefore he named it Galeed,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-49.htm"><b>49</b></a></span>and Mizpah,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Mizpah means watchpost">f</a></sup></span> for he said, &#8220;The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> watch between you and me, when we are out of one another&#8217;s sight.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-50.htm"><b>50</b></a></span>If you oppress my daughters, or if you take wives besides my daughters, although no one is with us, see, God is witness between you and me.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-51.htm"><b>51</b></a></span>Then Laban said to Jacob, &#8220;See this heap and the pillar, which I have set between you and me.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-52.htm"><b>52</b></a></span>This heap is a witness, and the pillar is a witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, to do harm.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-53.htm"><b>53</b></a></span>The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us.&#8221; So Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-54.htm"><b>54</b></a></span>and Jacob offered a sacrifice in the hill country and called his kinsmen to eat bread. They ate bread and spent the night in the hill country.</p>
