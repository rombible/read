<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Joseph&#8217;s Dreams</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Jacob lived in the land of his father&#8217;s sojournings, in the land of Canaan.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>These are the generations of Jacob.</p><p class="regular">Joseph, being seventeen years old, was pasturing the flock with his brothers. He was a boy with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father&#8217;s wives. And Joseph brought a bad report of them to their father.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Now Israel loved Joseph more than any other of his sons, because he was the son of his old age. And he made him a robe of many colors.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="See Septuagint, Vulgate; or (with Syriac) a robe with long sleeves. The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain; also verses 23, 32">a</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him and could not speak peacefully to him.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers they hated him even more.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>He said to them, &#8220;Hear this dream that I have dreamed:
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and behold, my sheaf arose and stood upright. And behold, your sheaves gathered around it and bowed down to my sheaf.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>His brothers said to him, &#8220;Are you indeed to reign over us? Or are you indeed to rule over us?&#8221; So they hated him even more for his dreams and for his words.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then he dreamed another dream and told it to his brothers and said, &#8220;Behold, I have dreamed another dream. Behold, the sun, the moon, and eleven stars were bowing down to me.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>But when he told it to his father and to his brothers, his father rebuked him and said to him, &#8220;What is this dream that you have dreamed? Shall I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow ourselves to the ground before you?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And his brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the saying in mind.</p>
<p class="heading">Joseph Sold by His Brothers</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now his brothers went to pasture their father&#8217;s flock near Shechem.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And Israel said to Joseph, &#8220;Are not your brothers pasturing the flock at Shechem? Come, I will send you to them.&#8221; And he said to him, &#8220;Here I am.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So he said to him, &#8220;Go now, see if it is well with your brothers and with the flock, and bring me word.&#8221; So he sent him from the Valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And a man found him wandering in the fields. And the man asked him, &#8220;What are you seeking?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>&#8220;I am seeking my brothers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Tell me, please, where they are pasturing the flock.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And the man said, &#8220;They have gone away, for I heard them say, &#8216;Let us go to Dothan.&#8217;&#8221; So Joseph went after his brothers and found them at Dothan.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>They saw him from afar, and before he came near to them they conspired against him to kill him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>They said to one another, &#8220;Here comes this dreamer.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Come now, let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or cisterns; also verses 22, 24">b</a></sup></span> Then we will say that a fierce animal has devoured him, and we will see what will become of his dreams.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>But when Reuben heard it, he rescued him out of their hands, saying, &#8220;Let us not take his life.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And Reuben said to them, &#8220;Shed no blood; throw him into this pit here in the wilderness, but do not lay a hand on him&#8221;&#8212;that he might rescue him out of their hand to restore him to his father.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe, the robe of many colors that he wore.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And they took him and threw him into a pit. The pit was empty; there was no water in it.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then they sat down to eat. And looking up they saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing gum, balm, and myrrh, on their way to carry it down to Egypt.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Then Judah said to his brothers, &#8220;What profit is it if we kill our brother and conceal his blood?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him, for he is our brother, our own flesh.&#8221; And his brothers listened to him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then Midianite traders passed by. And they drew Joseph up and lifted him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty shekels<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="A shekel was about 2/5 ounce or 11 grams">c</a></sup></span> of silver. They took Joseph to Egypt.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>When Reuben returned to the pit and saw that Joseph was not in the pit, he tore his clothes
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>and returned to his brothers and said, &#8220;The boy is gone, and I, where shall I go?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Then they took Joseph&#8217;s robe and slaughtered a goat and dipped the robe in the blood.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And they sent the robe of many colors and brought it to their father and said, &#8220;This we have found; please identify whether it is your son&#8217;s robe or not.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And he identified it and said, &#8220;It is my son&#8217;s robe. A fierce animal has devoured him. Joseph is without doubt torn to pieces.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Then Jacob tore his garments and put sackcloth on his loins and mourned for his son many days.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>All his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted and said, &#8220;No, I shall go down to Sheol to my son, mourning.&#8221; Thus his father wept for him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Meanwhile the Midianites had sold him in Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the guard.</p><A name="footnotes"></a><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">3</span> See Septuagint, Vulgate; or (with Syriac) <i>a robe with long sleeves</i>.
