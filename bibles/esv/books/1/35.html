<div class="chap"><p class="heading">God Blesses and Renames Jacob</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>God said to Jacob, &#8220;Arise, go up to Bethel and dwell there. Make an altar there to the God who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, &#8220;Put away the foreign gods that are among you and purify yourselves and change your garments.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then let us arise and go up to Bethel, so that I may make there an altar to the God who answers me in the day of my distress and has been with me wherever I have gone.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods that they had, and the rings that were in their ears. Jacob hid them under the terebinth tree that was near Shechem.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And as they journeyed, a terror from God fell upon the cities that were around them, so that they did not pursue the sons of Jacob.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and there he built an altar and called the place El-bethel,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="El-bethel means God of Bethel">a</a></sup></span> because there God had revealed himself to him when he fled from his brother.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And Deborah, Rebekah&#8217;s nurse, died, and she was buried under an oak below Bethel. So he called its name Allon-bacuth.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Allon-bacuth means oak of weeping">b</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>God appeared<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or had appeared">c</a></sup></span> to Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And God said to him, &#8220;Your name is Jacob; no longer shall your name be called Jacob, but Israel shall be your name.&#8221; So he called his name Israel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And God said to him, &#8220;I am God Almighty:<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew El Shaddai">d</a></sup></span> be fruitful and multiply. A nation and a company of nations shall come from you, and kings shall come from your own body.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew from your loins">e</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>The land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac I will give to you, and I will give the land to your offspring after you.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then God went up from him in the place where he had spoken with him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he had spoken with him, a pillar of stone. He poured out a drink offering on it and poured oil on it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So Jacob called the name of the place where God had spoken with him Bethel.</p>
<p class="heading">The Deaths of Rachel and Isaac</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then they journeyed from Bethel. When they were still some distance<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or about two hours' distance">f</a></sup></span> from Ephrath, Rachel went into labor, and she had hard labor.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And when her labor was at its hardest, the midwife said to her, &#8220;Do not fear, for you have another son.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And as her soul was departing (for she was dying), she called his name Ben-oni;<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Ben-oni could mean son of my sorrow, or son of my strength">g</a></sup></span> but his father called him Benjamin.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Benjamin means son of the right hand">h</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>So Rachel died, and she was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem),
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>and Jacob set up a pillar over her tomb. It is the pillar of Rachel&#8217;s tomb, which is there to this day.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Israel journeyed on and pitched his tent beyond the tower of Eder.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>While Israel lived in that land, Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father&#8217;s concubine. And Israel heard of it.</p><p class="regular">Now the sons of Jacob were twelve.

<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre, or Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had sojourned.
