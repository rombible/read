<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Isaac Blesses Jacob</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>When Isaac was old and his eyes were dim so that he could not see, he called Esau his older son and said to him, &#8220;My son&#8221;; and he answered, &#8220;Here I am.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>He said, &#8220;Behold, I am old; I do not know the day of my death.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Now then, take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt game for me,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and prepare for me delicious food, such as I love, and bring it to me so that I may eat, that my soul may bless you before I die.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now Rebekah was listening when Isaac spoke to his son Esau. So when Esau went to the field to hunt for game and bring it,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Rebekah said to her son Jacob, &#8220;I heard your father speak to your brother Esau,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8216;Bring me game and prepare for me delicious food, that I may eat it and bless you before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> before I die.&#8217;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Now therefore, my son, obey my voice as I command you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Go to the flock and bring me two good young goats, so that I may prepare from them delicious food for your father, such as he loves.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And you shall bring it to your father to eat, so that he may bless you before he dies.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, &#8220;Behold, my brother Esau is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Perhaps my father will feel me, and I shall seem to be mocking him and bring a curse upon myself and not a blessing.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>His mother said to him, &#8220;Let your curse be on me, my son; only obey my voice, and go, bring them to me.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So he went and took them and brought them to his mother, and his mother prepared delicious food, such as his father loved.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then Rebekah took the best garments of Esau her older son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And the skins of the young goats she put on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And she put the delicious food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>So he went in to his father and said, &#8220;My father.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Here I am. Who are you, my son?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Jacob said to his father, &#8220;I am Esau your firstborn. I have done as you told me; now sit up and eat of my game, that your soul may bless me.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>But Isaac said to his son, &#8220;How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?&#8221; He answered, &#8220;Because the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God granted me success.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then Isaac said to Jacob, &#8220;Please come near, that I may feel you, my son, to know whether you are really my son Esau or not.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So Jacob went near to Isaac his father, who felt him and said, &#8220;The voice is Jacob&#8217;s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And he did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau&#8217;s hands. So he blessed him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>He said, &#8220;Are you really my son Esau?&#8221; He answered, &#8220;I am.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then he said, &#8220;Bring it near to me, that I may eat of my son&#8217;s game and bless you.&#8221; So he brought it near to him, and he ate; and he brought him wine, and he drank.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Then his father Isaac said to him, &#8220;Come near and kiss me, my son.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>So he came near and kissed him. And Isaac smelled the smell of his garments and blessed him and said,</p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">&#8220;See, the smell of my son</span><br /><span class="indent">is as the smell of a field that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has blessed!</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span><span class="ln-group">May God give you of the dew of heaven</span><br /><span class="indent">and of the fatness of the earth</span><br /><span class="indent">and plenty of grain and wine.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span><span class="ln-group">Let peoples serve you,</span><br /><span class="indent">and nations bow down to you.</span><br /><span class="ln-group">Be lord over your brothers,</span><br /><span class="indent">and may your mother&#8217;s sons bow down to you.</span><br /><span class="ln-group">Cursed be everyone who curses you,</span><br /><span class="indent">and blessed be everyone who blesses you!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>As soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, when Jacob had scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, Esau his brother came in from his hunting.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>He also prepared delicious food and brought it to his father. And he said to his father, &#8220;Let my father arise and eat of his son&#8217;s game, that you may bless me.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>His father Isaac said to him, &#8220;Who are you?&#8221; He answered, &#8220;I am your son, your firstborn, Esau.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Then Isaac trembled very violently and said, &#8220;Who was it then that hunted game and brought it to me, and I ate it all before you came, and I have blessed him? Yes, and he shall be blessed.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>As soon as Esau heard the words of his father, he cried out with an exceedingly great and bitter cry and said to his father, &#8220;Bless me, even me also, O my father!&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>But he said, &#8220;Your brother came deceitfully, and he has taken away your blessing.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Esau said, &#8220;Is he not rightly named Jacob?<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Jacob means He takes by the heel, or He cheats">a</a></sup></span> For he has cheated me these two times. He took away my birthright, and behold, now he has taken away my blessing.&#8221; Then he said, &#8220;Have you not reserved a blessing for me?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>Isaac answered and said to Esau, &#8220;Behold, I have made him lord over you, and all his brothers I have given to him for servants, and with grain and wine I have sustained him. What then can I do for you, my son?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>Esau said to his father, &#8220;Have you but one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, O my father.&#8221; And Esau lifted up his voice and wept.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>Then Isaac his father answered and said to him:</p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">&#8220;Behold, away from<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or Behold, of">b</a></sup></span> the fatness of the earth shall your dwelling be,</span><br /><span class="indent">and away from<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or and of">c</a></sup></span> the dew of heaven on high.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span><span class="ln-group">By your sword you shall live,</span><br /><span class="indent">and you shall serve your brother;</span><br /><span class="ln-group">but when you grow restless</span><br /><span class="indent">you shall break his yoke from your neck.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>Now Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him, and Esau said to himself, &#8220;The days of mourning for my father are approaching; then I will kill my brother Jacob.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>But the words of Esau her older son were told to Rebekah. So she sent and called Jacob her younger son and said to him, &#8220;Behold, your brother Esau comforts himself about you by planning to kill you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>Now therefore, my son, obey my voice. Arise, flee to Laban my brother in Haran
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>and stay with him a while, until your brother&#8217;s fury turns away&#8212;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>until your brother&#8217;s anger turns away from you, and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send and bring you from there. Why should I be bereft of you both in one day?&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span>Then Rebekah said to Isaac, &#8220;I loathe my life because of the Hittite women.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew daughters of Heth">d</a></sup></span> If Jacob marries one of the Hittite women like these, one of the women of the land, what good will my life be to me?&#8221;</p><A name="footnotes"></a><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">36</span> <i class="catch-word">Jacob</i> means <i>He takes by the heel</i>, or <i>He cheats</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">39</span> Or <i><span class="catch-word">Behold</span>, of</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <span class="fnverse">39</span> Or <i><span class="catch-word">and</span> of</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">d</span> <span class="fnverse">46</span> Hebrew <i>daughters of Heth</i><br /></span></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
