<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Now Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And he journeyed on from the Negeb as far as Bethel to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>to the place where he had made an altar at the first. And there Abram called upon the name of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>so that the land could not support both of them dwelling together; for their possessions were so great that they could not dwell together,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram&#8217;s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot&#8217;s livestock. At that time the Canaanites and the Perizzites were dwelling in the land.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then Abram said to Lot, &#8220;Let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herdsmen and my herdsmen, for we are kinsmen.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew we are men, brothers">a</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Is not the whole land before you? Separate yourself from me. If you take the left hand, then I will go to the right, or if you take the right hand, then I will go to the left.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And Lot lifted up his eyes and saw that the Jordan Valley was well watered everywhere like the garden of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, like the land of Egypt, in the direction of Zoar. (This was before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.)
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So Lot chose for himself all the Jordan Valley, and Lot journeyed east. Thus they separated from each other.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Abram settled in the land of Canaan, while Lot settled among the cities of the valley and moved his tent as far as Sodom.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Now the men of Sodom were wicked, great sinners against the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to Abram, after Lot had separated from him, &#8220;Lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward,
