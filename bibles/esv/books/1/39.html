<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> was with Joseph, and he became a successful man, and he was in the house of his Egyptian master.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>His master saw that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> was with him and that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> caused all that he did to succeed in his hands.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So Joseph found favor in his sight and attended him, and he made him overseer of his house and put him in charge of all that he had.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>From the time that he made him overseer in his house and over all that he had, the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> blessed the Egyptian&#8217;s house for Joseph&#8217;s sake; the blessing of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> was on all that he had, in house and field.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So he left all that he had in Joseph&#8217;s charge, and because of him he had no concern about anything but the food he ate.</p><p class="regular">Now Joseph was handsome in form and appearance.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And after a time his master&#8217;s wife cast her eyes on Joseph and said, &#8220;Lie with me.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But he refused and said to his master&#8217;s wife, &#8220;Behold, because of me my master has no concern about anything in the house, and he has put everything that he has in my charge.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>He is not greater in this house than I am, nor has he kept back anything from me except you, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness and sin against God?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And as she spoke to Joseph day after day, he would not listen to her, to lie beside her or to be with her.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But one day, when he went into the house to do his work and none of the men of the house was there in the house,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>she caught him by his garment, saying, &#8220;Lie with me.&#8221; But he left his garment in her hand and fled and got out of the house.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And as soon as she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled out of the house,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>she called to the men of her household and said to them, &#8220;See, he has brought among us a Hebrew to laugh at us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried out with a loud voice.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And as soon as he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried out, he left his garment beside me and fled and got out of the house.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then she laid up his garment by her until his master came home,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>and she told him the same story, saying, &#8220;The Hebrew servant, whom you have brought among us, came in to me to laugh at me.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>But as soon as I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment beside me and fled out of the house.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>As soon as his master heard the words that his wife spoke to him, &#8220;This is the way your servant treated me,&#8221; his anger was kindled.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And Joseph&#8217;s master took him and put him into the prison, the place where the king&#8217;s prisoners were confined, and he was there in prison.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>But the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> was with Joseph and showed him steadfast love and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And the keeper of the prison put Joseph in charge of all the prisoners who were in the prison. Whatever was done there, he was the one who did it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>The keeper of the prison paid no attention to anything that was in Joseph&#8217;s charge, because the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> was with him. And whatever he did, the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> made it succeed.</p></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
