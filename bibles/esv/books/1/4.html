<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And again, she bore his brother Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, and Cain a worker of the ground.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>In the course of time Cain brought to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> an offering of the fruit of the ground,

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>but for Cain and his offering he had no regard. So Cain was very angry, and his face fell.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to Cain, &#8220;Why are you angry, and why has your face fallen?

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to Cain, &#8220;Where is Abel your brother?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I do not know; am I my brother&#8217;s keeper?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said, &#8220;What have you done? The voice of your brother&#8217;s blood is crying to me from the ground.
