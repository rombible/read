<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/16-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Sarai said to Abram, &#8220;Behold now, the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has prevented me from bearing children.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/16-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So, after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, Sarai, Abram&#8217;s wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her servant, and gave her to Abram her husband as a wife.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/16-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But Abram said to Sarai, &#8220;Behold, your servant is in your power; do to her as you please.&#8221; Then Sarai dealt harshly with her, and she fled from her.</p>
