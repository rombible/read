<div class="chap"><p class="heading">By Faith</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>For by it the people of old received their commendation.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>By faith we understand that the universe was created by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things that are visible.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>By faith Abel offered to God a more acceptable sacrifice than Cain, through which he was commended as righteous, God commending him by accepting his gifts. And through his faith, though he died, he still speaks.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>By faith Enoch was taken up so that he should not see death, and he was not found, because God had taken him. Now before he was taken he was commended as having pleased God.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>By faith Noah, being warned by God concerning events as yet unseen, in reverent fear constructed an ark for the saving of his household. By this he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes by faith.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place that he was to receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he was going.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>By faith he went to live in the land of promise, as in a foreign land, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, heirs with him of the same promise.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For he was looking forward to the city that has foundations, whose designer and builder is God.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>By faith Sarah herself received power to conceive, even when she was past the age, since she considered him faithful who had promised.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Therefore from one man, and him as good as dead, were born descendants as many as the stars of heaven and as many as the innumerable grains of sand by the seashore.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>These all died in faith, not having received the things promised, but having seen them and greeted them from afar, and having acknowledged that they were strangers and exiles on the earth.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For people who speak thus make it clear that they are seeking a homeland.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>If they had been thinking of that land from which they had gone out, they would have had opportunity to return.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared for them a city.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was in the act of offering up his only son,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>of whom it was said, &#8220;Through Isaac shall your offspring be named.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>He considered that God was able even to raise him from the dead, from which, figuratively speaking, he did receive him back.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>By faith Isaac invoked future blessings on Jacob and Esau.

<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw that the child was beautiful, and they were not afraid of the king&#8217;s edict.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>choosing rather to be mistreated with the people of God than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>He considered the reproach of Christ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking to the reward.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>By faith he left Egypt, not being afraid of the anger of the king, for he endured as seeing him who is invisible.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>By faith he kept the Passover and sprinkled the blood, so that the Destroyer of the firstborn might not touch them.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>By faith the people crossed the Red Sea as on dry land, but the Egyptians, when they attempted to do the same, were drowned.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>By faith Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient, because she had given a friendly welcome to the spies.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And what more shall I say? For time would fail me to tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets&#8212;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>who through faith conquered kingdoms, enforced justice, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Women received back their dead by resurrection. Some were tortured, refusing to accept release, so that they might rise again to a better life.
