<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Warning Against Neglecting Salvation</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Therefore we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard, lest we drift away from it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>For since the message declared by angels proved to be reliable, and every transgression or disobedience received a just retribution,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation? It was declared at first by the Lord, and it was attested to us by those who heard,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>while God also bore witness by signs and wonders and various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will.</p>
<p class="heading">The Founder of Salvation</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For it was not to angels that God subjected the world to come, of which we are speaking.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>It has been testified somewhere,</p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">&#8220;What is man, that you are mindful of him,</span><br /><span class="indent">or the son of man, that you care for him?</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span><span class="ln-group">You made him for a little while lower than the angels;</span><br /><span class="indent">you have crowned him with glory and honor,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts insert and set him over the works of your hands">a</a></sup></span></span><br />

At present, we do not yet see everything in subjection to him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But we see him who for a little while was made lower than the angels, namely Jesus, crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For it was fitting that he, for whom and by whom all things exist, in bringing many sons to glory, should make the founder of their salvation perfect through suffering.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one source.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek all are of one">b</a></sup></span> That is why he is not ashamed to call them brothers,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or brothers and sisters.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>saying,</p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">&#8220;I will tell of your name to my brothers;</span><br /><span class="indent">in the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="same-paragraph"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And again,</p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">&#8220;I will put my trust in him.&#8221;</span></p><p class="same-paragraph">And again,</p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">&#8220;Behold, I and the children God has given me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same things, that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>For surely it is not angels that he helps, but he helps the offspring of Abraham.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Therefore he had to be made like his brothers in every respect, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>For because he himself has suffered when tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.</p><A name="footnotes"></a><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">7</span> Some manuscripts insert <i>and set him over the works of your hands</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">11</span> Greek <i><span class="catch-word">all</span> are of one</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <span class="fnverse">11</span> Or <i><span class="catch-word">brothers</span> and sisters</i>.
