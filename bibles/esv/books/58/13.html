<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Remember those who are in prison, as though in prison with them, and those who are mistreated, since you also are in the body.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled, for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Keep your life free from love of money, and be content with what you have, for he has said, &#8220;I will never leave you nor forsake you.&#8221;

<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Remember your leaders, those who spoke to you the word of God. Consider the outcome of their way of life, and imitate their faith.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Do not be led away by diverse and strange teachings, for it is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace, not by foods, which have not benefited those devoted to them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>We have an altar from which those who serve the tent<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or tabernacle">a</a></sup></span> have no right to eat.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the holy places by the high priest as a sacrifice for sin are burned outside the camp.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So Jesus also suffered outside the gate in order to sanctify the people through his own blood.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Therefore let us go to him outside the camp and bear the reproach he endured.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Do not neglect to do good and to share what you have, for such sacrifices are pleasing to God.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they are keeping watch over your souls, as those who will have to give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with groaning, for that would be of no advantage to you.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Pray for us, for we are sure that we have a clear conscience, desiring to act honorably in all things.
