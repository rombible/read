<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>a minister in the holy places, in the true tent<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or tabernacle; also verse 5">a</a></sup></span> that the Lord set up, not man.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices; thus it is necessary for this priest also to have something to offer.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, since there are priests who offer gifts according to the law.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>They serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things. For when Moses was about to erect the tent, he was instructed by God, saying, &#8220;See that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown you on the mountain.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But as it is, Christ<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek he">b</a></sup></span> has obtained a ministry that is as much more excellent than the old as the covenant he mediates is better, since it is enacted on better promises.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion to look for a second.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For he finds fault with them when he says:<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts For finding fault with it he says to them">c</a></sup></span></p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">&#8220;Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord,</span><br /><span class="indent">when I will establish a new covenant with the house of Israel</span><br /><span class="indent">and with the house of Judah,</span><br />
