<div class="chap"><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us fear lest any of you should seem to have failed to reach it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>For good news came to us just as to them, but the message they heard did not benefit them, because they were not united by faith with those who listened.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts it did not meet with faith in the hearers">a</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For we who have believed enter that rest, as he has said,</p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">&#8220;As I swore in my wrath,</span><br /><span class="ln-group">&#8216;They shall not enter my rest,&#8217;&#8221;</span></p><p class="same-paragraph">although his works were finished from the foundation of the world.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For he has somewhere spoken of the seventh day in this way: &#8220;And God rested on the seventh day from all his works.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And again in this passage he said,</p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">&#8220;They shall not enter my rest.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="same-paragraph"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Since therefore it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly received the good news failed to enter because of disobedience,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>again he appoints a certain day, &#8220;Today,&#8221; saying through David so long afterward, in the words already quoted,</p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">&#8220;Today, if you hear his voice,</span><br /><span class="ln-group">do not harden your hearts.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="same-paragraph"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For if Joshua had given them rest, God<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek he">b</a></sup></span> would not have spoken of another day later on.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So then, there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>for whoever has entered God&#8217;s rest has also rested from his works as God did from his.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Let us therefore strive to enter that rest, so that no one may fall by the same sort of disobedience.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And no creature is hidden from his sight, but all are naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give account.</p>
<p class="heading">Jesus the Great High Priest</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.</p><A name="footnotes"></a><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">2</span> Some manuscripts <i>it did not meet with faith in the hearers</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">8</span> Greek <i>he</i><br /></span></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
