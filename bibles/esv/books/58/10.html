<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Christ&#8217;s Sacrifice Once for All</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>For since the law has but a shadow of the good things to come instead of the true form of these realities, it can never, by the same sacrifices that are continually offered every year, make perfect those who draw near.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, since the worshipers, having once been cleansed, would no longer have any consciousness of sins?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But in these sacrifices there is a reminder of sins every year.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Consequently, when Christ<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek he">a</a></sup></span> came into the world, he said,</p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">&#8220;Sacrifices and offerings you have not desired,</span><br /><span class="indent">but a body have you prepared for me;</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span><span class="ln-group">in burnt offerings and sin offerings</span><br /><span class="indent">you have taken no pleasure.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span><span class="ln-group">Then I said, &#8216;Behold, I have come to do your will, O God,</span><br /><span class="indent">as it is written of me in the scroll of the book.&#8217;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="same-paragraph"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>When he said above, &#8220;You have neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings&#8221; (these are offered according to the law),
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>then he added, &#8220;Behold, I have come to do your will.&#8221; He does away with the first in order to establish the second.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And every priest stands daily at his service, offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But when Christ<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek this one">b</a></sup></span> had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>waiting from that time until his enemies should be made a footstool for his feet.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And the Holy Spirit also bears witness to us; for after saying,</p>
<span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span><span class="ln-group">&#8220;This is the covenant that I will make with them</span><br /><span class="indent">after those days, declares the Lord:</span><br /><span class="ln-group">I will put my laws on their hearts,</span><br /><span class="indent">and write them on their minds,&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="same-paragraph"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>then he adds,</p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">&#8220;I will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="same-paragraph"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin.</p>
<p class="heading">The Full Assurance of Faith</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Therefore, brothers,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or brothers and sisters">c</a></sup></span> since we have confidence to enter the holy places by the blood of Jesus,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>by the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain, that is, through his flesh,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>and since we have a great priest over the house of God,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>For if we go on sinning deliberately after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>but a fearful expectation of judgment, and a fury of fire that will consume the adversaries.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Anyone who has set aside the law of Moses dies without mercy on the evidence of two or three witnesses.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>How much worse punishment, do you think, will be deserved by the one who has trampled underfoot the Son of God, and has profaned the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has outraged the Spirit of grace?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>For we know him who said, &#8220;Vengeance is mine; I will repay.&#8221; And again, &#8220;The Lord will judge his people.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>But recall the former days when, after you were enlightened, you endured a hard struggle with sufferings,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>sometimes being publicly exposed to reproach and affliction, and sometimes being partners with those so treated.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>For you had compassion on those in prison, and you joyfully accepted the plundering of your property, since you knew that you yourselves had a better possession and an abiding one.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Therefore do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>For you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God you may receive what is promised.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>For,</p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">&#8220;Yet a little while,</span><br /><span class="indent">and the coming one will come and will not delay;</span><br />
