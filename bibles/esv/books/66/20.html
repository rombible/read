<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/20-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/20-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and threw him into the pit, and shut it and sealed it over him, so that he might not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were ended. After that he must be released for a little while.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/20-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then I saw thrones, and seated on them were those to whom the authority to judge was committed. Also I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of God, and those who had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/20-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended. This is the first resurrection.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/20-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Blessed and holy is the one who shares in the first resurrection! Over such the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and they will reign with him for a thousand years.</p>
<p class="heading">The Defeat of Satan</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/20-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And when the thousand years are ended, Satan will be released from his prison
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/20-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>and will come out to deceive the nations that are at the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them for battle; their number is like the sand of the sea.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/20-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And they marched up over the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city, but fire came down from heaven<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts from God, out of heaven, or out of heaven from God">b</a></sup></span> and consumed them,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/20-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur where the beast and the false prophet were, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.</p>
<p class="heading">Judgment Before the Great White Throne</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/20-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/20-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/20-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And the sea gave up the dead who were in it, Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them, and they were judged, each one of them, according to what they had done.
