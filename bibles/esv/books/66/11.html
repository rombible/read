<div class="chap"><p class="heading">The Two Witnesses</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/11-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Then I was given a measuring rod like a staff, and I was told, &#8220;Rise and measure the temple of God and the altar and those who worship there,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>but do not measure the court outside the temple; leave that out, for it is given over to the nations, and they will trample the holy city for forty-two months.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And I will grant authority to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for 1,260 days, clothed in sackcloth.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And if anyone would harm them, fire pours from their mouth and consumes their foes. If anyone would harm them, this is how he is doomed to be killed.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>They have the power to shut the sky, that no rain may fall during the days of their prophesying, and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague, as often as they desire.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And when they have finished their testimony, the beast that rises from the bottomless pit<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or the abyss">a</a></sup></span> will make war on them and conquer them and kill them,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>and their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city that symbolically<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek spiritually">b</a></sup></span> is called Sodom and Egypt, where their Lord was crucified.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For three and a half days some from the peoples and tribes and languages and nations will gaze at their dead bodies and refuse to let them be placed in a tomb,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and those who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them and make merry and exchange presents, because these two prophets had been a torment to those who dwell on the earth.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But after the three and a half days a breath of life from God entered them, and they stood up on their feet, and great fear fell on those who saw them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, &#8220;Come up here!&#8221; And they went up to heaven in a cloud, and their enemies watched them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And at that hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/11-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>The second woe has passed; behold, the third woe is soon to come.</p>
<p class="heading">The Seventh Trumpet</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/11-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then the seventh angel blew his trumpet, and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, &#8220;The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he shall reign forever and ever.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/11-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And the twenty-four elders who sit on their thrones before God fell on their faces and worshiped God,
