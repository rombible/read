<div class="chap"><p class="heading">The Great Prostitute and the Beast</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/17-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and said to me, &#8220;Come, I will show you the judgment of the great prostitute who is seated on many waters,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/17-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>with whom the kings of the earth have committed sexual immorality, and with the wine of whose sexual immorality the dwellers on earth have become drunk.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/17-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And he carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness, and I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was full of blasphemous names, and it had seven heads and ten horns.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/17-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>The woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and jewels and pearls, holding in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the impurities of her sexual immorality.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/17-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And on her forehead was written a name of mystery: &#8220;Babylon the great, mother of prostitutes and of earth&#8217;s abominations.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/17-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And I saw the woman, drunk with the blood of the saints, the blood of the martyrs of Jesus.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek the witnesses to Jesus">a</a></sup></span></p><p class="regular">When I saw her, I marveled greatly.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/17-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But the angel said to me, &#8220;Why do you marvel? I will tell you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast with seven heads and ten horns that carries her.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/17-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to rise from the bottomless pit<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek the abyss">b</a></sup></span> and go to destruction. And the dwellers on earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world will marvel to see the beast, because it was and is not and is to come.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/17-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>This calls for a mind with wisdom: the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/17-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>they are also seven kings, five of whom have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come, and when he does come he must remain only a little while.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/17-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>As for the beast that was and is not, it is an eighth but it belongs to the seven, and it goes to destruction.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/17-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And the ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received royal power, but they are to receive authority as kings for one hour, together with the beast.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/17-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>These are of one mind, and they hand over their power and authority to the beast.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/17-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>They will make war on the Lamb, and the Lamb will conquer them, for he is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those with him are called and chosen and faithful.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/17-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And the angel<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek he">c</a></sup></span> said to me, &#8220;The waters that you saw, where the prostitute is seated, are peoples and multitudes and nations and languages.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/17-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And the ten horns that you saw, they and the beast will hate the prostitute. They will make her desolate and naked, and devour her flesh and burn her up with fire,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/17-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>for God has put it into their hearts to carry out his purpose by being of one mind and handing over their royal power to the beast, until the words of God are fulfilled.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/17-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And the woman that you saw is the great city that has dominion over the kings of the earth.&#8221;</p><A name="footnotes"></a><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">6</span> Greek <i><span class="catch-word">the</span> witnesses to Jesus</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">8</span> Greek <i><span class="catch-word">the</span> abyss</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <span class="fnverse">15</span> Greek <i>he</i><br /></span></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
