<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And I looked, and behold, a white horse! And its rider had a bow, and a crown was given to him, and he came out conquering, and to conquer.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>When he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, &#8220;Come!&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/6-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And out came another horse, bright red. Its rider was permitted to take peace from the earth, so that people should slay one another, and he was given a great sword.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/6-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>When he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, &#8220;Come!&#8221; And I looked, and behold, a black horse! And its rider had a pair of scales in his hand.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And I heard what seemed to be a voice in the midst of the four living creatures, saying, &#8220;A quart<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek choinix, a dry measure equal to about a quart">a</a></sup></span> of wheat for a denarius,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="A denarius was a day's wage for a laborer">b</a></sup></span> and three quarts of barley for a denarius, and do not harm the oil and wine!&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>When he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, &#8220;Come!&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And I looked, and behold, a pale horse! And its rider&#8217;s name was Death, and Hades followed him. And they were given authority over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword and with famine and with pestilence and by wild beasts of the earth.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and for the witness they had borne.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/6-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>They cried out with a loud voice, &#8220;O Sovereign Lord, holy and true, how long before you will judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/6-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then they were each given a white robe and told to rest a little longer, until the number of their fellow servants and their brothers<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or brothers and sisters.

<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/6-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>When he opened the sixth seal, I looked, and behold, there was a great earthquake, and the sun became black as sackcloth, the full moon became like blood,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/6-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>and the stars of the sky fell to the earth as the fig tree sheds its winter fruit when shaken by a gale.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/6-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>The sky vanished like a scroll that is being rolled up, and every mountain and island was removed from its place.
