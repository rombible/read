<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And the beast that I saw was like a leopard; its feet were like a bear&#8217;s, and its mouth was like a lion&#8217;s mouth. And to it the dragon gave his power and his throne and great authority.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>One of its heads seemed to have a mortal wound, but its mortal wound was healed, and the whole earth marveled as they followed the beast.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And they worshiped the dragon, for he had given his authority to the beast, and they worshiped the beast, saying, &#8220;Who is like the beast, and who can fight against it?&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And the beast was given a mouth uttering haughty and blasphemous words, and it was allowed to exercise authority for forty-two months.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/13-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>It opened its mouth to utter blasphemies against God, blaspheming his name and his dwelling,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or tabernacle">a</a></sup></span> that is, those who dwell in heaven.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/13-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Also it was allowed to make war on the saints and to conquer them.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts omit this sentence">b</a></sup></span> And authority was given it over every tribe and people and language and nation,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>and all who dwell on earth will worship it, everyone whose name has not been written before the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb who was slain.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/13-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>It performs great signs, even making fire come down from heaven to earth in front of people,

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/13-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And it was allowed to give breath to the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast might even speak and might cause those who would not worship the image of the beast to be slain.
