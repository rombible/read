<div class="chap"><p class="heading">The Scroll and the Lamb</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/5-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Then I saw in the right hand of him who was seated on the throne a scroll written within and on the back, sealed with seven seals.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, &#8220;Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or to look into it,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and I began to weep loudly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And one of the elders said to me, &#8220;Weep no more; behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered, so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders I saw a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, with seven horns and with seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And he went and took the scroll from the right hand of him who was seated on the throne.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And when he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each holding a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And they sang a new song, saying,</p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">&#8220;Worthy are you to take the scroll</span><br /><span class="indent">and to open its seals,</span><br /><span class="ln-group">for you were slain, and by your blood you ransomed people for God</span><br /><span class="indent">from every tribe and language and people and nation,</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><span class="ln-group">and you have made them a kingdom and priests to our God,</span><br /><span class="indent">and they shall reign on the earth.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="same-paragraph"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then I looked, and I heard around the throne and the living creatures and the elders the voice of many angels, numbering myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands,
