<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>He opened the shaft of the bottomless pit, and from the shaft rose smoke like the smoke of a great furnace, and the sun and the air were darkened with the smoke from the shaft.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then from the smoke came locusts on the earth, and they were given power like the power of scorpions of the earth.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>They were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any green plant or any tree, but only those people who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>They were allowed to torment them for five months, but not to kill them, and their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it stings someone.

<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>In appearance the locusts were like horses prepared for battle: on their heads were what looked like crowns of gold; their faces were like human faces,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>their hair like women&#8217;s hair, and their teeth like lions&#8217; teeth;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>they had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the noise of their wings was like the noise of many chariots with horses rushing into battle.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>They have tails and stings like scorpions, and their power to hurt people for five months is in their tails.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>They have as king over them the angel of the bottomless pit.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So the four angels, who had been prepared for the hour, the day, the month, and the year, were released to kill a third of mankind.
