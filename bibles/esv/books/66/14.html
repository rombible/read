<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/14-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And I heard a voice from heaven like the roar of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder. The voice I heard was like the sound of harpists playing on their harps,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/14-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and they were singing a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and before the elders. No one could learn that song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/14-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>It is these who have not defiled themselves with women, for they are virgins. It is these who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These have been redeemed from mankind as firstfruits for God and the Lamb,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/14-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and in their mouth no lie was found, for they are blameless.</p>
<p class="heading">The Messages of the Three Angels</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/14-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then I saw another angel flying directly overhead, with an eternal gospel to proclaim to those who dwell on earth, to every nation and tribe and language and people.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/14-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And he said with a loud voice, &#8220;Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of his judgment has come, and worship him who made heaven and earth, the sea and the springs of water.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/14-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Another angel, a second, followed, saying, &#8220;Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, she who made all nations drink the wine of the passion<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or wrath">a</a></sup></span> of her sexual immorality.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/14-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a loud voice, &#8220;If anyone worships the beast and its image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/14-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>he also will drink the wine of God&#8217;s wrath, poured full strength into the cup of his anger, and he will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/14-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever, and they have no rest, day or night, these worshipers of the beast and its image, and whoever receives the mark of its name.&#8221;</p>

<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/14-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And I heard a voice from heaven saying, &#8220;Write this: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.&#8221; &#8220;Blessed indeed,&#8221; says the Spirit, &#8220;that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds follow them!&#8221;</p>
<p class="heading">The Harvest of the Earth</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/14-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and seated on the cloud one like a son of man, with a golden crown on his head, and a sharp sickle in his hand.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/14-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And another angel came out of the temple, calling with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud, &#8220;Put in your sickle, and reap, for the hour to reap has come, for the harvest of the earth is fully ripe.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/14-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So he who sat on the cloud swung his sickle across the earth, and the earth was reaped.</p>
