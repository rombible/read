<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.

<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away.
