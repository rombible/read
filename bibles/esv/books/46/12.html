<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>You know that when you were pagans you were led astray to mute idols, however you were led.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Therefore I want you to understand that no one speaking in the Spirit of God ever says &#8220;Jesus is accursed!&#8221; and no one can say &#8220;Jesus is Lord&#8221; except in the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and there are varieties of service, but the same Lord;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and there are varieties of activities, but it is the same God who empowers them all in everyone.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For to one is given through the Spirit the utterance of wisdom, and to another the utterance of knowledge according to the same Spirit,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another the ability to distinguish between spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>All these are empowered by one and the same Spirit, who apportions to each one individually as he wills.</p>
<p class="heading">One Body with Many Members</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body&#8212;Jews or Greeks, slaves<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="For the contextual rendering of the Greek word doulos, see Preface">d</a></sup></span> or free&#8212;and all were made to drink of one Spirit.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For the body does not consist of one member but of many.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>If the foot should say, &#8220;Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,&#8221; that would not make it any less a part of the body.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And if the ear should say, &#8220;Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,&#8221; that would not make it any less a part of the body.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>If the whole body were an eye, where would be the sense of hearing? If the whole body were an ear, where would be the sense of smell?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>But as it is, God arranged the members in the body, each one of them, as he chose.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>If all were a single member, where would the body be?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>As it is, there are many parts,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or members; also verse 22">e</a></sup></span> yet one body.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>The eye cannot say to the hand, &#8220;I have no need of you,&#8221; nor again the head to the feet, &#8220;I have no need of you.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>On the contrary, the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>and on those parts of the body that we think less honorable we bestow the greater honor, and our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>which our more presentable parts do not require. But God has so composed the body, giving greater honor to the part that lacked it,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>If one member suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, all rejoice together.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healing, helping, administrating, and various kinds of tongues.
