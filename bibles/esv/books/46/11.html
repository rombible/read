<p class="heading">Head Coverings</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Now I commend you because you remember me in everything and maintain the traditions even as I delivered them to you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, the head of a wife<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek gune. This term may refer to a woman or a wife, depending on the context">a</a></sup></span> is her husband,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek aner. This term may refer to a man or a husband, depending on the context">b</a></sup></span> and the head of Christ is God.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>but every wife<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="In verses 5-13, the Greek word gune is translated wife in verses that deal with wearing a veil, a sign of being married in first-century culture">c</a></sup></span> who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head, since it is the same as if her head were shaven.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>For if a wife will not cover her head, then she should cut her hair short. But since it is disgraceful for a wife to cut off her hair or shave her head, let her cover her head.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For a man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God, but woman is the glory of man.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For man was not made from woman, but woman from man.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Neither was man created for woman, but woman for man.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>That is why a wife ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or messengers, that is, people sent to observe and report">d</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Nevertheless, in the Lord woman is not independent of man nor man of woman;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>for as woman was made from man, so man is now born of woman. And all things are from God.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Judge for yourselves: is it proper for a wife to pray to God with her head uncovered?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Does not nature itself teach you that if a man wears long hair it is a disgrace for him,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>but if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For her hair is given to her for a covering.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>If anyone is inclined to be contentious, we have no such practice, nor do the churches of God.</p>
<p class="heading">The Lord&#8217;s Supper</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But in the following instructions I do not commend you, because when you come together it is not for the better but for the worse.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>For, in the first place, when you come together as a church, I hear that there are divisions among you. And I believe it in part,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or I believe a certain report">e</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>for there must be factions among you in order that those who are genuine among you may be recognized.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>When you come together, it is not the Lord&#8217;s supper that you eat.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>For in eating, each one goes ahead with his own meal. One goes hungry, another gets drunk.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>What! Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I commend you in this? No, I will not.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, <span class="woc">&#8220;This is my body, which is for<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts broken for">f</a></sup></span> you. Do this in remembrance of me.&#8221;<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or as my memorial; also verse 25">g</a></sup></span></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, saying, <span class="woc">&#8220;This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.&#8221;</span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord&#8217;s death until he comes.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty concerning the body and blood of the Lord.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Let a person examine himself, then, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on himself.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some have died.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek have fallen asleep (as in 15:6, 20)">h</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>But if we judged<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or discerned">i</a></sup></span> ourselves truly, we would not be judged.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or when we are judged we are being disciplined by the Lord">j</a></sup></span> so that we may not be condemned along with the world.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>So then, my brothers,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or brothers and sisters">k</a></sup></span> when you come together to eat, wait for<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or share with">l</a></sup></span> one another&#8212;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home&#8212;so that when you come together it will not be for judgment.
