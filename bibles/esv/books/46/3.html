<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>I fed you with milk, not solid food, for you were not ready for it. And even now you are not yet ready,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>for you are still of the flesh. For while there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not of the flesh and behaving only in a human way?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For when one says, &#8220;I follow Paul,&#8221; and another, &#8220;I follow Apollos,&#8221; are you not being merely human?</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>What then is Apollos? What is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, as the Lord assigned to each.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>He who plants and he who waters are one, and each will receive his wages according to his labor.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For we are God&#8217;s fellow workers. You are God&#8217;s field, God&#8217;s building.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>According to the grace of God given to me, like a skilled<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or wise">b</a></sup></span> master builder I laid a foundation, and someone else is building upon it. Let each one take care how he builds upon it.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For no one can lay a foundation other than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw&#8212;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>each one&#8217;s work will become manifest, for the Day will disclose it, because it will be revealed by fire, and the fire will test what sort of work each one has done.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>If the work that anyone has built on the foundation survives, he will receive a reward.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>If anyone&#8217;s work is burned up, he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, but only as through fire.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Do you not know that you<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="The Greek for you is plural in verses 16 and 17">c</a></sup></span> are God&#8217;s temple and that God&#8217;s Spirit dwells in you?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>If anyone destroys God&#8217;s temple, God will destroy him. For God&#8217;s temple is holy, and you are that temple.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you thinks that he is wise in this age, let him become a fool that he may become wise.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>For the wisdom of this world is folly with God. For it is written, &#8220;He catches the wise in their craftiness,&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>and again, &#8220;The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are futile.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>So let no one boast in men. For all things are yours,
