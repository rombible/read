<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Greeting</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Paul, called by the will of God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus, and our brother Sosthenes,</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>To the church of God that is in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints together with all those who in every place call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both their Lord and ours:</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="heading">Thanksgiving</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>I give thanks to my God always for you because of the grace of God that was given you in Christ Jesus,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>that in every way you were enriched in him in all speech and all knowledge&#8212;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>even as the testimony about Christ was confirmed among you&#8212;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>so that you are not lacking in any gift, as you wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>who will sustain you to the end, guiltless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>God is faithful, by whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
<p class="heading">Divisions in the Church</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>I appeal to you, brothers,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or brothers and sisters. In New Testament usage, depending on the context, the plural Greek word adelphoi (translated brothers) may refer either to brothers or to brothers and sisters; also verses 11, 26">a</a></sup></span> by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree, and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be united in the same mind and the same judgment.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For it has been reported to me by Chloe&#8217;s people that there is quarreling among you, my brothers.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>What I mean is that each one of you says, &#8220;I follow Paul,&#8221; or &#8220;I follow Apollos,&#8221; or &#8220;I follow Cephas,&#8221; or &#8220;I follow Christ.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>so that no one may say that you were baptized in my name.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>(I did baptize also the household of Stephanas. Beyond that, I do not know whether I baptized anyone else.)
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>For Christ did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospel, and not with words of eloquent wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.</p>
<p class="heading">Christ the Wisdom and Power of God</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>For the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>For it is written,</p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">&#8220;I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,</span><br /><span class="indent">and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart.&#8221;</span></p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, it pleased God through the folly of what we preach<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or the folly of preaching">b</a></sup></span> to save those who believe.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>For Jews demand signs and Greeks seek wisdom,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>For consider your calling, brothers: not many of you were wise according to worldly standards,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek according to the flesh">c</a></sup></span> not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>God chose what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not, to bring to nothing things that are,
