<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Or do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is to be judged by you, are you incompetent to try trivial cases?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Do you not know that we are to judge angels? How much more, then, matters pertaining to this life!
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So if you have such cases, why do you lay them before those who have no standing in the church?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>I say this to your shame. Can it be that there is no one among you wise enough to settle a dispute between the brothers,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>but brother goes to law against brother, and that before unbelievers?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>To have lawsuits at all with one another is already a defeat for you. Why not rather suffer wrong? Why not rather be defrauded?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But you yourselves wrong and defraud&#8212;even your own brothers!<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or brothers and sisters">a</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Or do you not know that the unrighteous<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or wrongdoers">b</a></sup></span> will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="The two Greek terms translated by this phrase refer to the passive and active partners in consensual homosexual acts">c</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.</p>

The body is not meant for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And God raised the Lord and will also raise us up by his power.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Never!
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Or do you not know that he who is joined<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or who holds fast (compare Genesis 2:24 and Deuteronomy 10:20); also verse 17">d</a></sup></span> to a prostitute becomes one body with her? For, as it is written, &#8220;The two will become one flesh.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But he who is joined to the Lord becomes one spirit with him.
