<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and all ate the same spiritual food,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank from the spiritual Rock that followed them, and the Rock was Christ.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Nevertheless, with most of them God was not pleased, for they were overthrown<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or were laid low">b</a></sup></span> in the wilderness.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now these things took place as examples for us, that we might not desire evil as they did.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Do not be idolaters as some of them were; as it is written, &#8220;The people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>We must not indulge in sexual immorality as some of them did, and twenty-three thousand fell in a single day.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>We must not put Christ<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts the Lord">c</a></sup></span> to the test, as some of them did and were destroyed by serpents,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>nor grumble, as some of them did and were destroyed by the Destroyer.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now these things happened to them as an example, but they were written down for our instruction, on whom the end of the ages has come.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Therefore let anyone who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>I speak as to sensible people; judge for yourselves what I say.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Consider the people of Israel:<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek Consider Israel according to the flesh">d</a></sup></span> are not those who eat the sacrifices participants in the altar?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>What do I imply then? That food offered to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>No, I imply that what pagans sacrifice they offer to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be participants with demons.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Shall we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he?</p>
<p class="heading">Do All to the Glory of God</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>&#8220;All things are lawful,&#8221; but not all things are helpful. &#8220;All things are lawful,&#8221; but not all things build up.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Let no one seek his own good, but the good of his neighbor.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Eat whatever is sold in the meat market without raising any question on the ground of conscience.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>For &#8220;the earth is the Lord&#8217;s, and the fullness thereof.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>If one of the unbelievers invites you to dinner and you are disposed to go, eat whatever is set before you without raising any question on the ground of conscience.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>But if someone says to you, &#8220;This has been offered in sacrifice,&#8221; then do not eat it, for the sake of the one who informed you, and for the sake of conscience&#8212;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>I do not mean your conscience, but his. For why should my liberty be determined by someone else&#8217;s conscience?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of that for which I give thanks?</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.
