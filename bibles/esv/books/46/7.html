<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Principles for Marriage</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Now concerning the matters about which you wrote: &#8220;It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>But because of the temptation to sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights, and likewise the wife to her husband.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For the wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does. Likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Do not deprive one another, except perhaps by agreement for a limited time, that you may devote yourselves to prayer; but then come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now as a concession, not a command, I say this.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or I say this:">a</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>I wish that all were as I myself am. But each has his own gift from God, one of one kind and one of another.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is good for them to remain single, as I am.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But if they cannot exercise self-control, they should marry. For it is better to marry than to burn with passion.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>To the married I give this charge (not I, but the Lord): the wife should not separate from her husband
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>(but if she does, she should remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband), and the husband should not divorce his wife.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>To the rest I say (I, not the Lord) that if any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever, and she consents to live with him, he should not divorce her.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>If any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever, and he consents to live with her, she should not divorce him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For the unbelieving husband is made holy because of his wife, and the unbelieving wife is made holy because of her husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But if the unbelieving partner separates, let it be so. In such cases the brother or sister is not enslaved. God has called you<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts us">b</a></sup></span> to peace.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>For how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?</p>
<p class="heading">Live as You Are Called</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Only let each person lead the life<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or each person walk in the way">c</a></sup></span> that the Lord has assigned to him, and to which God has called him. This is my rule in all the churches.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Was anyone at the time of his call already circumcised? Let him not seek to remove the marks of circumcision. Was anyone at the time of his call uncircumcised? Let him not seek circumcision.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>For neither circumcision counts for anything nor uncircumcision, but keeping the commandments of God.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Each one should remain in the condition in which he was called.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Were you a bondservant<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="For the contextual rendering of the Greek word doulos, see Preface; also verses 22 (twice), 23">d</a></sup></span> when called? Do not be concerned about it. (But if you can gain your freedom, avail yourself of the opportunity.)
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>For he who was called in the Lord as a bondservant is a freedman of the Lord. Likewise he who was free when called is a bondservant of Christ.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>You were bought with a price; do not become bondservants of men.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>So, brothers,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or brothers and sisters; also verse 29">e</a></sup></span> in whatever condition each was called, there let him remain with God.</p>
<p class="heading">The Unmarried and the Widowed</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Now concerning<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="The expression Now concerning introduces a reply to a question in the Corinthians' letter; see 7:1">f</a></sup></span> the betrothed,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek virgins">g</a></sup></span> I have no command from the Lord, but I give my judgment as one who by the Lord&#8217;s mercy is trustworthy.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>I think that in view of the present<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or impending">h</a></sup></span> distress it is good for a person to remain as he is.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be free. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek a wife.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>But if you do marry, you have not sinned, and if a betrothed woman<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek virgin; also verse 34">i</a></sup></span> marries, she has not sinned. Yet those who marry will have worldly troubles, and I would spare you that.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>This is what I mean, brothers: the appointed time has grown very short. From now on, let those who have wives live as though they had none,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>and those who mourn as though they were not mourning, and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing, and those who buy as though they had no goods,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>and those who deal with the world as though they had no dealings with it. For the present form of this world is passing away.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>I want you to be free from anxieties. The unmarried man is anxious about the things of the Lord, how to please the Lord.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>But the married man is anxious about worldly things, how to please his wife,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>and his interests are divided. And the unmarried or betrothed woman is anxious about the things of the Lord, how to be holy in body and spirit. But the married woman is anxious about worldly things, how to please her husband.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>I say this for your own benefit, not to lay any restraint upon you, but to promote good order and to secure your undivided devotion to the Lord.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>If anyone thinks that he is not behaving properly toward his betrothed,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek virgin; also verses 37, 38">j</a></sup></span> if his<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or her">k</a></sup></span> passions are strong, and it has to be, let him do as he wishes: let them marry&#8212;it is no sin.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>But whoever is firmly established in his heart, being under no necessity but having his desire under control, and has determined this in his heart, to keep her as his betrothed, he will do well.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>So then he who marries his betrothed does well, and he who refrains from marriage will do even better.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to be married to whom she wishes, only in the Lord.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>Yet in my judgment she is happier if she remains as she is.
