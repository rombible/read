<div class="chap"><p class="heading">The Ministry of Apostles</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>This is how one should regard us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Moreover, it is required of stewards that they be found faithful.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by any human court. In fact, I do not even judge myself.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For I am not aware of anything against myself, but I am not thereby acquitted. It is the Lord who judges me.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Therefore do not pronounce judgment before the time, before the Lord comes, who will bring to light the things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart. Then each one will receive his commendation from God.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>I have applied all these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, brothers,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or brothers and sisters">a</a></sup></span> that you may learn by us not to go beyond what is written, that none of you may be puffed up in favor of one against another.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For who sees anything different in you? What do you have that you did not receive? If then you received it, why do you boast as if you did not receive it?</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Already you have all you want! Already you have become rich! Without us you have become kings! And would that you did reign, so that we might share the rule with you!
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For I think that God has exhibited us apostles as last of all, like men sentenced to death, because we have become a spectacle to the world, to angels, and to men.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>We are fools for Christ&#8217;s sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are held in honor, but we in disrepute.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>To the present hour we hunger and thirst, we are poorly dressed and buffeted and homeless,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>and we labor, working with our own hands. When reviled, we bless; when persecuted, we endure;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>when slandered, we entreat. We have become, and are still, like the scum of the world, the refuse of all things.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>I do not write these things to make you ashamed, but to admonish you as my beloved children.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>For though you have countless<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek you have ten thousand">b</a></sup></span> guides in Christ, you do not have many fathers. For I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>I urge you, then, be imitators of me.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>That is why I sent<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or am sending">c</a></sup></span> you Timothy, my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, to remind you of my ways in Christ,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts add Jesus">d</a></sup></span> as I teach them everywhere in every church.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Some are arrogant, as though I were not coming to you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>But I will come to you soon, if the Lord wills, and I will find out not the talk of these arrogant people but their power.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>For the kingdom of God does not consist in talk but in power.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>What do you wish?
