<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>This is good, and it is pleasing in the sight of God our Savior,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="men and man render the same Greek word that is translated people in verses 1 and 4">a</a></sup></span> Christ Jesus,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>who gave himself as a ransom for all, which is the testimony given at the proper time.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For this I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I am telling the truth, I am not lying), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>I desire then that in every place the men should pray, lifting holy hands without anger or quarreling;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>likewise also that women should adorn themselves in respectable apparel, with modesty and self-control, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly attire,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>but with what is proper for women who profess godliness&#8212;with good works.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; rather, she is to remain quiet.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor.
