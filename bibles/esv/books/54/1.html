<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>nor to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies, which promote speculations rather than the stewardship<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or good order">a</a></sup></span> from God that is by faith.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>The aim of our charge is love that issues from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Certain persons, by swerving from these, have wandered away into vain discussion,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>desiring to be teachers of the law, without understanding either what they are saying or the things about which they make confident assertions.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Now we know that the law is good, if one uses it lawfully,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>understanding this, that the law is not laid down for the just but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who strike their fathers and mothers, for murderers,

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>and the grace of our Lord overflowed for me with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But I received mercy for this reason, that in me, as the foremost, Jesus Christ might display his perfect patience as an example to those who were to believe in him for eternal life.
