<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>through the insincerity of liars whose consciences are seared,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>who forbid marriage and require abstinence from foods that God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>for it is made holy by the word of God and prayer.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Have nothing to do with irreverent, silly myths. Rather train yourself for godliness;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>for while bodily training is of some value, godliness is of value in every way, as it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come.
