<div class="chap"><p class="heading">God&#8217;s Sovereign Choice</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>I am speaking the truth in Christ&#8212;I am not lying; my conscience bears me witness in the Holy Spirit&#8212;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>that I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or brothers and sisters">a</a></sup></span> my kinsmen according to the flesh.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>They are Israelites, and to them belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>To them belong the patriarchs, and from their race, according to the flesh, is the Christ, who is God over all, blessed forever. Amen.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But it is not as though the word of God has failed. For not all who are descended from Israel belong to Israel,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and not all are children of Abraham because they are his offspring, but &#8220;Through Isaac shall your offspring be named.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>This means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as offspring.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For this is what the promise said: &#8220;About this time next year I will return, and Sarah shall have a son.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And not only so, but also when Rebekah had conceived children by one man, our forefather Isaac,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>though they were not yet born and had done nothing either good or bad&#8212;in order that God&#8217;s purpose of election might continue, not because of works but because of him who calls&#8212;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>she was told, &#8220;The older will serve the younger.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>As it is written, &#8220;Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>What shall we say then? Is there injustice on God&#8217;s part? By no means!
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>For he says to Moses, &#8220;I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So then it depends not on human will or exertion,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek not of him who wills or runs">b</a></sup></span> but on God, who has mercy.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, &#8220;For this very purpose I have raised you up, that I might show my power in you, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>So then he has mercy on whomever he wills, and he hardens whomever he wills.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>You will say to me then, &#8220;Why does he still find fault? For who can resist his will?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>But who are you, O man, to answer back to God? Will what is molded say to its molder, &#8220;Why have you made me like this?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Has the potter no right over the clay, to make out of the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for dishonorable use?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>What if God, desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>in order to make known the riches of his glory for vessels of mercy, which he has prepared beforehand for glory&#8212;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>even us whom he has called, not from the Jews only but also from the Gentiles?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>As indeed he says in Hosea,</p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">&#8220;Those who were not my people I will call &#8216;my people,&#8217;</span><br /><span class="indent">and her who was not beloved I will call &#8216;beloved.&#8217;&#8221;</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span><span class="ln-group">&#8220;And in the very place where it was said to them, &#8216;You are not my people,&#8217;</span><br /><span class="indent">there they will be called &#8216;sons of the living God.&#8217;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: &#8220;Though the number of the sons of Israel<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or children of Israel">c</a></sup></span> be as the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them will be saved,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>for the Lord will carry out his sentence upon the earth fully and without delay.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And as Isaiah predicted,</p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">&#8220;If the Lord of hosts had not left us offspring,</span><br /><span class="indent">we would have been like Sodom</span><br /><span class="indent">and become like Gomorrah.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="heading">Israel&#8217;s Unbelief</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>What shall we say, then? That Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have attained it, that is, a righteousness that is by faith;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>but that Israel who pursued a law that would lead to righteousness<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek a law of righteousness">d</a></sup></span> did not succeed in reaching that law.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as if it were based on works. They have stumbled over the stumbling stone,
