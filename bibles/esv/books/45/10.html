<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For, being ignorant of the righteousness of God, and seeking to establish their own, they did not submit to God&#8217;s righteousness.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or end of the law, that everyone who believes may be justified">b</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="heading">The Message of Salvation to All</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For Moses writes about the righteousness that is based on the law, that the person who does the commandments shall live by them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But the righteousness based on faith says, &#8220;Do not say in your heart, &#8216;Who will ascend into heaven?&#8217;&#8221; (that is, to bring Christ down)
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8220;or &#8216;Who will descend into the abyss?&#8217;&#8221; (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But what does it say? &#8220;The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart&#8221; (that is, the word of faith that we proclaim);
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For the Scripture says, &#8220;Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, bestowing his riches on all who call on him.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For &#8220;everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard?<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or him whom they have never heard">c</a></sup></span> And how are they to hear without someone preaching?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And how are they to preach unless they are sent? As it is written, &#8220;How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the good news!&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, &#8220;Lord, who has believed what he has heard from us?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>But I ask, have they not heard? Indeed they have, for</p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">&#8220;Their voice has gone out to all the earth,</span><br /><span class="indent">and their words to the ends of the world.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="same-paragraph"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>But I ask, did Israel not understand?

<p class="same-paragraph"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then Isaiah is so bold as to say,</p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">&#8220;I have been found by those who did not seek me;</span><br /><span class="indent">I have shown myself to those who did not ask for me.&#8221;</span></p>
