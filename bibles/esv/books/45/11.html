<div class="chap"><p class="heading">The Remnant of Israel</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>I ask, then, has God rejected his people? By no means! For I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or one of the offspring of Abraham">a</a></sup></span> a member of the tribe of Benjamin.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the Scripture says of Elijah, how he appeals to God against Israel?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8220;Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have demolished your altars, and I alone am left, and they seek my life.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But what is God&#8217;s reply to him? &#8220;I have kept for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So too at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>What then? Israel failed to obtain what it was seeking. The elect obtained it, but the rest were hardened,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>as it is written,</p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">&#8220;God gave them a spirit of stupor,</span><br /><span class="indent">eyes that would not see</span><br /><span class="indent">and ears that would not hear,</span><br /><span class="ln-group">down to this very day.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="same-paragraph"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And David says,</p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">&#8220;Let their table become a snare and a trap,</span><br /><span class="indent">a stumbling block and a retribution for them;</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><span class="ln-group">let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see,</span><br /><span class="indent">and bend their backs forever.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="heading">Gentiles Grafted In</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So I ask, did they stumble in order that they might fall? By no means! Rather, through their trespass salvation has come to the Gentiles, so as to make Israel jealous.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now if their trespass means riches for the world, and if their failure means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their full inclusion<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek their fullness">b</a></sup></span> mean!</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>in order somehow to make my fellow Jews jealous, and thus save some of them.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>If the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, so is the whole lump, and if the root is holy, so are the branches.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, although a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing root<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek root of richness; some manuscripts richness">c</a></sup></span> of the olive tree,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>do not be arrogant toward the branches. If you are, remember it is not you who support the root, but the root that supports you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then you will say, &#8220;Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand fast through faith. So do not become proud, but fear.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Note then the kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen, but God&#8217;s kindness to you, provided you continue in his kindness. Otherwise you too will be cut off.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And even they, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>For if you were cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these, the natural branches, be grafted back into their own olive tree.</p>
<p class="heading">The Mystery of Israel&#8217;s Salvation</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Lest you be wise in your own sight, I do not want you to be unaware of this mystery, brothers:<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or brothers and sisters">d</a></sup></span> a partial hardening has come upon Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And in this way all Israel will be saved, as it is written,</p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">&#8220;The Deliverer will come from Zion,</span><br /><span class="indent">he will banish ungodliness from Jacob&#8221;;</span><br />

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>For God has consigned all to disobedience, that he may have mercy on all.</p>
