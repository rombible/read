<div class="chap"><p class="heading">The Example of Christ</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>We who are strong have an obligation to bear with the failings of the weak, and not to please ourselves.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Let each of us please his neighbor for his good, to build him up.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For Christ did not please himself, but as it is written, &#8220;The reproaches of those who reproached you fell on me.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction, that through endurance and through the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>May the God of endurance and encouragement grant you to live in such harmony with one another, in accord with Christ Jesus,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>that together you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Therefore welcome one another as Christ has welcomed you, for the glory of God.</p>
<p class="heading">Christ the Hope of Jews and Gentiles</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For I tell you that Christ became a servant to the circumcised to show God&#8217;s truthfulness, in order to confirm the promises given to the patriarchs,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and in order that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written,</p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">&#8220;Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles,</span><br /><span class="indent">and sing to your name.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="same-paragraph"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And again it is said,</p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">&#8220;Rejoice, O Gentiles, with his people.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="same-paragraph"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And again,</p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">&#8220;Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles,</span><br /><span class="indent">and let all the peoples extol him.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="same-paragraph"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And again Isaiah says,</p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">&#8220;The root of Jesse will come,</span><br /><span class="indent">even he who arises to rule the Gentiles;</span><br /><span class="ln-group">in him will the Gentiles hope.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="same-paragraph"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound in hope.</p>
<p class="heading">Paul the Minister to the Gentiles</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>I myself am satisfied about you, my brothers,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or brothers and sisters; also verse 30">a</a></sup></span> that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge and able to instruct one another.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But on some points I have written to you very boldly by way of reminder, because of the grace given me by God
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles in the priestly service of the gospel of God, so that the offering of the Gentiles may be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>In Christ Jesus, then, I have reason to be proud of my work for God.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>For I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me to bring the Gentiles to obedience&#8212;by word and deed,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>by the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God&#8212;so that from Jerusalem and all the way around to Illyricum I have fulfilled the ministry of the gospel of Christ;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>and thus I make it my ambition to preach the gospel, not where Christ has already been named, lest I build on someone else&#8217;s foundation,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>but as it is written,</p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">&#8220;Those who have never been told of him will see,</span><br /><span class="indent">and those who have never heard will understand.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="heading">Paul&#8217;s Plan to Visit Rome</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>This is the reason why I have so often been hindered from coming to you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>But now, since I no longer have any room for work in these regions, and since I have longed for many years to come to you,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>I hope to see you in passing as I go to Spain, and to be helped on my journey there by you, once I have enjoyed your company for a while.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>At present, however, I am going to Jerusalem bringing aid to the saints.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>For Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make some contribution for the poor among the saints at Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>For they were pleased to do it, and indeed they owe it to them. For if the Gentiles have come to share in their spiritual blessings, they ought also to be of service to them in material blessings.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>When therefore I have completed this and have delivered to them what has been collected,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek sealed to them this fruit">b</a></sup></span> I will leave for Spain by way of you.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>I know that when I come to you I will come in the fullness of the blessing<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts insert of the gospel">c</a></sup></span> of Christ.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>I appeal to you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me in your prayers to God on my behalf,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>that I may be delivered from the unbelievers in Judea, and that my service for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints,
