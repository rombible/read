<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/12-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Do not be conformed to this world,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek age">c</a></sup></span> but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God">d</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="heading">Gifts of Grace</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/12-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For by the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think with sober judgment, each according to the measure of faith that God has assigned.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/12-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For as in one body we have many members,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek parts; also verse 5">e</a></sup></span> and the members do not all have the same function,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/12-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>so we, though many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/12-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us use them: if prophecy, in proportion to our faith;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/12-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>if service, in our serving; the one who teaches, in his teaching;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/12-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>the one who exhorts, in his exhortation; the one who contributes, in generosity; the one who leads,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or gives aid">f</a></sup></span> with zeal; the one who does acts of mercy, with cheerfulness.</p>
