<div class="chap"><p class="heading">God&#8217;s Righteous Judgment</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Therefore you have no excuse, O man, every one of you who judges. For in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself, because you, the judge, practice the very same things.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>We know that the judgment of God rightly falls on those who practice such things.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Do you suppose, O man&#8212;you who judge those who practice such things and yet do them yourself&#8212;that you will escape the judgment of God?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Or do you presume on the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience, not knowing that God&#8217;s kindness is meant to lead you to repentance?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But because of your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God&#8217;s righteous judgment will be revealed.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>He will render to each one according to his works:
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>but for those who are self-seeking<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or contentious">a</a></sup></span> and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, there will be wrath and fury.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>There will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>but glory and honor and peace for everyone who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For God shows no partiality.</p>
<p class="heading">God&#8217;s Judgment and the Law</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>For all who have sinned without the law will also perish without the law, and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law who will be justified.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness, and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>on that day when, according to my gospel, God judges the secrets of men by Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law and boast in God
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>and know his will and approve what is excellent, because you are instructed from the law;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>and if you are sure that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of children, having in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth&#8212;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>you then who teach others, do you not teach yourself? While you preach against stealing, do you steal?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>You who say that one must not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>You who boast in the law dishonor God by breaking the law.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>For, as it is written, &#8220;The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>For circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the law, but if you break the law, your circumcision becomes uncircumcision.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>So, if a man who is uncircumcised keeps the precepts of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or counted">b</a></sup></span> as circumcision?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Then he who is physically<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or is by nature">c</a></sup></span> uncircumcised but keeps the law will condemn you who have the written code<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or the letter">d</a></sup></span> and circumcision but break the law.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>For no one is a Jew who is merely one outwardly, nor is circumcision outward and physical.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>But a Jew is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter. His praise is not from man but from God.</p><A name="footnotes"></a><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">8</span> Or <i>contentious</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">26</span> Or <i>counted</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <span class="fnverse">27</span> Or <i><span class="catch-word">is</span> by nature</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">d</span> <span class="fnverse">27</span> Or <i><span class="catch-word">the</span> letter</i><br /></span></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
