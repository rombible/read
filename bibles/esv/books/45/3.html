<div class="chap"><p class="heading">God&#8217;s Righteousness Upheld</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Then what advantage has the Jew? Or what is the value of circumcision?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Much in every way. To begin with, the Jews were entrusted with the oracles of God.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>What if some were unfaithful? Does their faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of God?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>By no means! Let God be true though every one were a liar, as it is written,</p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">&#8220;That you may be justified in your words,</span><br /><span class="indent">and prevail when you are judged.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="same-paragraph"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But if our unrighteousness serves to show the righteousness of God, what shall we say? That God is unrighteous to inflict wrath on us? (I speak in a human way.)
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>By no means! For then how could God judge the world?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But if through my lie God&#8217;s truth abounds to his glory, why am I still being condemned as a sinner?
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And why not do evil that good may come?&#8212;as some people slanderously charge us with saying. Their condemnation is just.</p>
<p class="heading">No One Is Righteous</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>What then? Are we Jews<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek Are we">a</a></sup></span> any better off?<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or at any disadvantage?">b</a></sup></span> No, not at all. For we have already charged that all, both Jews and Greeks, are under sin,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>as it is written:</p><span class="block-indent"><p class="line-group"><span class="ln-group">&#8220;None is righteous, no, not one;</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span><span class="indent">no one understands;</span><br /><span class="indent">no one seeks for God.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span><span class="ln-group">All have turned aside; together they have become worthless;</span><br /><span class="indent">no one does good,</span><br /><span class="indent">not even one.&#8221;</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span><span class="ln-group">&#8220;Their throat is an open grave;</span><br /><span class="indent">they use their tongues to deceive.&#8221;</span><br /><span class="ln-group">&#8220;The venom of asps is under their lips.&#8221;</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span><span class="indent">&#8220;Their mouth is full of curses and bitterness.&#8221;</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span><span class="ln-group">&#8220;Their feet are swift to shed blood;</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span><span class="indent">in their paths are ruin and misery,</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span><span class="ln-group">and the way of peace they have not known.&#8221;</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span><span class="indent">&#8220;There is no fear of God before their eyes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and the whole world may be held accountable to God.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>For by works of the law no human being<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek flesh">c</a></sup></span> will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin.</p>
<p class="heading">The Righteousness of God Through Faith</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it&#8212;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction:
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God&#8217;s righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Then what becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By a law of works? No, but by the law of faith.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>since God is one&#8212;who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Do we then overthrow the law by this faith? By no means! On the contrary, we uphold the law.</p><A name="footnotes"></a><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">9</span> Greek <i class="catch-word">Are we</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">9</span> Or <i>at any disadvantage?</i><br /><span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <span class="fnverse">20</span> Greek <i>flesh</i><br /></span></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot">
