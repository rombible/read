<div class="chap"><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/7-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>So the king and Haman went in to feast with Queen Esther.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/7-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And on the second day, as they were drinking wine after the feast, the king again said to Esther, &#8220;What is your wish, Queen Esther? It shall be granted you. And what is your request? Even to the half of my kingdom, it shall be fulfilled.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/7-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then Queen Esther answered, &#8220;If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be granted me for my wish, and my people for my request.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For we have been sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be killed, and to be annihilated. If we had been sold merely as slaves, men and women, I would have been silent, for our affliction is not to be compared with the loss to the king.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/7-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther, &#8220;Who is he, and where is he, who has dared<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew whose heart has filled him">a</a></sup></span> to do this?&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/7-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And Esther said, &#8220;A foe and enemy! This wicked Haman!&#8221; Then Haman was terrified before the king and the queen.</p>
<p class="heading">Haman Is Hanged</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/7-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And the king arose in his wrath from the wine-drinking and went into the palace garden, but Haman stayed to beg for his life from Queen Esther, for he saw that harm was determined against him by the king.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/7-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And the king returned from the palace garden to the place where they were drinking wine, as Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was. And the king said, &#8220;Will he even assault the queen in my presence, in my own house?&#8221; As the word left the mouth of the king, they covered Haman&#8217;s face.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then Harbona, one of the eunuchs in attendance on the king, said, &#8220;Moreover, the gallows<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or wooden beam; also verse 10 (see note on 2:23)">b</a></sup></span> that Haman has prepared for Mordecai, whose word saved the king, is standing at Haman&#8217;s house, fifty cubits<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="A cubit was about 18 inches or 45 centimeters">c</a></sup></span> high.&#8221; And the king said, &#8220;Hang him on that.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai.
