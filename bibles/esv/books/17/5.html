<div class="chap"><p class="heading">Esther Prepares a Banquet</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/5-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>On the third day Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner court of the king&#8217;s palace, in front of the king&#8217;s quarters, while the king was sitting on his royal throne inside the throne room opposite the entrance to the palace.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And when the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court, she won favor in his sight, and he held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. Then Esther approached and touched the tip of the scepter.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And the king said to her, &#8220;What is it, Queen Esther? What is your request? It shall be given you, even to the half of my kingdom.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And Esther said, &#8220;If it please the king,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew If it is good to the king">a</a></sup></span> let the king and Haman come today to a feast that I have prepared for the king.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then the king said, &#8220;Bring Haman quickly, so that we may do as Esther has asked.&#8221; So the king and Haman came to the feast that Esther had prepared.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And as they were drinking wine after the feast, the king said to Esther, &#8220;What is your wish? It shall be granted you. And what is your request? Even to the half of my kingdom, it shall be fulfilled.&#8221;<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or done">b</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then Esther answered, &#8220;My wish and my request is:
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it please the king<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew if it is good to the king">c</a></sup></span> to grant my wish and fulfill my request, let the king and Haman come to the feast that I will prepare for them, and tomorrow I will do as the king has said.&#8221;</p>
<p class="heading">Haman Plans to Hang Mordecai</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And Haman went out that day joyful and glad of heart. But when Haman saw Mordecai in the king&#8217;s gate, that he neither rose nor trembled before him, he was filled with wrath against Mordecai.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Nevertheless, Haman restrained himself and went home, and he sent and brought his friends and his wife Zeresh.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And Haman recounted to them the splendor of his riches, the number of his sons, all the promotions with which the king had honored him, and how he had advanced him above the officials and the servants of the king.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then Haman said, &#8220;Even Queen Esther let no one but me come with the king to the feast she prepared. And tomorrow also I am invited by her together with the king.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/5-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Yet all this is worth nothing to me, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king&#8217;s gate.&#8221;
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/5-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then his wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him, &#8220;Let a gallows<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or wooden beam; twice in this verse (see note on 2:23)">d</a></sup></span> fifty cubits<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="A cubit was about 18 inches or 45 centimeters">e</a></sup></span> high be made, and in the morning tell the king to have Mordecai hanged upon it.
