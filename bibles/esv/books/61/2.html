<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And many will follow their sensuality, and because of them the way of truth will be blasphemed.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And in their greed they will exploit you with false words. Their condemnation from long ago is not idle, and their destruction is not asleep.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and especially those who indulge<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek who go after the flesh">e</a></sup></span> in the lust of defiling passion and despise authority.</p><p class="regular">Bold and willful, they do not tremble as they blaspheme the glorious ones,

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Forsaking the right way, they have gone astray. They have followed the way of Balaam, the son of Beor, who loved gain from wrongdoing,
