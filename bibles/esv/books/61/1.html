<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>May grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.</p>
<p class="heading">Confirm Your Calling and Election</p><p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who called us to<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or by">c</a></sup></span> his own glory and excellence,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or virtue">d</a></sup></span>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>by which he has granted to us his precious and very great promises, so that through them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world because of sinful desire.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith with virtue,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or excellence; twice in this verse">e</a></sup></span> and virtue with knowledge,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with steadfastness, and steadfastness with godliness,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For if these qualities<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek these things; also verses 9, 10, 12">f</a></sup></span> are yours and are increasing, they keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For whoever lacks these qualities is so nearsighted that he is blind, having forgotten that he was cleansed from his former sins.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Therefore, brothers,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or brothers and sisters. In New Testament usage, depending on the context, the plural Greek word adelphoi (translated brothers) may refer either to brothers or to brothers and sisters">g</a></sup></span> be all the more diligent to confirm your calling and election, for if you practice these qualities you will never fall.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For in this way there will be richly provided for you an entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="regular"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Therefore I intend always to remind you of these qualities, though you know them and are established in the truth that you have.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>I think it right, as long as I am in this body,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek tent; also verse 14">h</a></sup></span> to stir you up by way of reminder,
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>since I know that the putting off of my body will be soon, as our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me.
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And I will make every effort so that after my departure you may be able at any time to recall these things.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>For when he received honor and glory from God the Father, and the voice was borne to him by the Majestic Glory, &#8220;This is my beloved Son,<span class="footnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or my Son, my (or the) Beloved">i</a></sup></span> with whom I am well pleased,&#8221;

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>knowing this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture comes from someone&#8217;s own interpretation.
