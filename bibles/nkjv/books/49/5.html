<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And walk in love, as Christ also has loved us and given Himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling aroma.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness, let it not even be named among you, as is fitting for saints; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor coarse jesting, which are not fitting, but rather giving of thanks. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>this you know, that no fornicator, unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Therefore do not be partakers with them.</span></p> <h3>
Walk in Light</span></h3><p><span class="text Eph-5-8"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For you were once darkness, but now <i>you are</i> light in the Lord. Walk as children of light </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>(for the fruit of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>Spirit <i>is</i> in all goodness, righteousness, and truth), </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>finding out what is acceptable to the Lord. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>expose <i>them.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>For it is shameful even to speak of those things which are done by them in secret. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>But all things that are <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>exposed are made manifest by the light, for whatever makes manifest is light. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Therefore He says:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Eph-5-14">&#8220;Awake, you who sleep,</span><br /><span class="text Eph-5-14">Arise from the dead,</span><br /><span class="text Eph-5-14">And Christ will give you light.&#8221;</span></p></div> <h3>
Walk in Wisdom</span></h3><p><span class="text Eph-5-15"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>See then that you walk <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>circumspectly, not as fools but as wise, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Therefore do not be unwise, but understand what the will of the Lord <i>is.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissipation; but be filled with the Spirit, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>giving thanks always for all things to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>submitting to one another in the fear of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>God.</span></p> <h3>
Marriage&#8212;Christ and the Church</span></h3><p><span class="text Eph-5-22"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>For the husband is head of the wife, as also Christ is head of the church; and He is the Savior of the body. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Therefore, just as the church is subject to Christ, so <i>let</i> the wives <i>be</i> to their own husbands in everything.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself for her, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>that He might <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>sanctify and cleanse her with the washing of water by the word, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>that He might present her to Himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she should be holy and without blemish. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>So husbands ought to love their own wives as their own bodies; he who loves his wife loves himself. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as the Lord <i>does</i> the church. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>For we are members of His body, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>of His flesh and of His bones. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span><span class="oblique">&#8220;For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the</span> <span class="oblique">two shall become one flesh.&#8221;</span> </span>
