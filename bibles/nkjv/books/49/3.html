<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>if indeed you have heard of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>dispensation of the grace of God which was given to me for you, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>how that by revelation He made known to me the mystery (as I have briefly written already, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>by which, when you read, you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ), </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>which in other ages was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to His holy apostles and prophets: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, of the same body, and partakers of His promise in Christ through the gospel, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>of which I became a minister according to the gift of the grace of God given to me by the effective working of His power.</span></p> <h3>
Purpose of the Mystery</span></h3><p><span class="text Eph-3-8"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>To me, who am less than the least of all the saints, this grace was given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and to make all see what <i>is</i> the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the ages has been hidden in God who created all things <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>through Jesus Christ; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>to the intent that now the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>manifold wisdom of God might be made known by the church to the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>principalities and powers in the heavenly <i>places,</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>according to the eternal purpose which He accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through faith in Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Therefore I ask that you do not lose heart at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.</span></p> <h3>
Appreciation of the Mystery</span></h3><p><span class="text Eph-3-14"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For this reason I bow my knees to the Father <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>of our Lord Jesus Christ, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>from whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with might through His Spirit in the inner man, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>may be able to comprehend with all the saints what <i>is</i> the width and length and depth and height&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge; that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>to Him <i>be</i> glory in the church by Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever.
