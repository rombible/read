<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span><span class="oblique">&#8220;Honor your father and mother,&#8221;</span> which is the first commandment with promise: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span><span class="oblique">&#8220;that it may be well with you and you may live long on the earth.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And you, fathers, do not provoke your children to wrath, but bring them up in the training and admonition of the Lord.</span></p> <h3>
Bondservants and Masters</span></h3><p><span class="text Eph-6-5"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Bondservants, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in sincerity of heart, as to Christ; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>not with eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but as bondservants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>with goodwill doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>knowing that whatever good anyone does, he will receive the same from the Lord, whether <i>he is</i> a slave or free.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And you, masters, do the same things to them, giving up threatening, knowing that <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>your own Master also is in heaven, and there is no partiality with Him.</span></p> <h3>
The Whole Armor of God</span></h3><p><span class="text Eph-6-10"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>wiles of the devil. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>the darkness of this age, against spiritual <i>hosts</i> of wickedness in the heavenly <i>places.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Stand therefore, having girded your waist with truth, having put on the breastplate of righteousness, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>above all, taking the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, being watchful to this end with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints&#8212; </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>for which I am an ambassador in chains; that in it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.</span></p> <h3>
A Gracious Greeting</span></h3><p><span class="text Eph-6-21"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>But that you also may know my affairs <i>and</i> how I am doing, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will make all things known to you; </span>
