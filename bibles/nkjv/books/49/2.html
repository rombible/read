<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>in which you once walked according to the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit who now works in the sons of disobedience, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>among whom also we all once conducted ourselves in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, just as the others.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But God, who is rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>even when we were dead in trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved), </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and raised <i>us</i> up together, and made <i>us</i> sit together in the heavenly <i>places</i> in Christ Jesus, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>that in the ages to come He might show the exceeding riches of His grace in <i>His</i> kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; <i>it is</i> the gift of God, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>not of works, lest anyone should boast. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.</span></p> <h3>
Brought Near by His Blood</span></h3><p><span class="text Eph-2-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Therefore remember that you, once Gentiles in the flesh&#8212;who are called Uncircumcision by what is called the Circumcision made in the flesh by hands&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>that at that time you were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ.</span></p> <h3>
Christ Our Peace</span></h3><p><span class="text Eph-2-14"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For He Himself is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of separation, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>having abolished in His flesh the enmity, <i>that is,</i> the law of commandments <i>contained</i> in ordinances, so as to create in Himself one new man <i>from</i> the two, <i>thus</i> making peace, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>and that He might reconcile them both to God in one body through the cross, thereby putting to death the enmity. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And He came and preached peace to you who were afar off and to those who were near. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>For through Him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father.</span></p> <h3>
Christ Our Cornerstone</span></h3><p><span class="text Eph-2-19"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Now, therefore, you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief corner<i>stone,</i> </span>
