<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>who was faithful to Him who appointed Him, as Moses also <i>was faithful</i> in all His house. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For this One has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as He who built the house has more honor than the house. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For every house is built by someone, but He who built all things <i>is</i> God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And Moses indeed <i>was</i> faithful in all His house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which would be spoken <i>afterward,</i> </span>
