<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>For if the word spoken through angels proved steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>reward, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation, which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed to us by those who heard <i>Him,</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>God also bearing witness both with signs and wonders, with various miracles, and gifts<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> of the Holy Spirit, according to His own will?</span></p> <h3>
The Son Made Lower than Angels</span></h3><p><span class="text Heb-2-5"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For He has not put the world to come, of which we speak, in subjection to angels. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But one testified in a certain place, saying:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Heb-2-6"><span class="oblique">&#8220;What is man that You are mindful of him,</span></span><br /><span class="text Heb-2-6"><span class="oblique">Or the son of man that You take care of him?</span></span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span><span class="oblique">You have made him</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span><span class="oblique">a little lower than the angels;</span></span><br /><span class="text Heb-2-7"><span class="oblique">You have crowned him with glory and honor,</span></span><br /><span class="text Heb-2-7"><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span><span class="oblique">And set him over the works of Your hands.</span></span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><span class="oblique">You have put all things in subjection under his feet.&#8221;</span></span></p></div><p class="first-line-none top-1"><span class="text Heb-2-8">For in that He put all in subjection under him, He left nothing <i>that is</i> not put under him. But now we do not yet see all things put under him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But we see Jesus, who was made <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, that He, by the grace of God, might taste death for everyone.</span></p> <h3>
Bringing Many Sons to Glory</span></h3><p><span class="text Heb-2-10"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For it was fitting for Him, for whom <i>are</i> all things and by whom <i>are</i> all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For both He who <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>sanctifies and those who are being sanctified <i>are</i> all of one, for which reason He is not ashamed to call them brethren, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>saying:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Heb-2-12"><span class="oblique">&#8220;I will declare Your name to My brethren;</span></span><br /><span class="text Heb-2-12"><span class="oblique">In the midst of the assembly I will sing praise to You.&#8221;</span></span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And again:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Heb-2-13"><span class="oblique">&#8220;I will put My trust in Him.&#8221;</span></span></p></div><p class="first-line-none top-1"><span class="text Heb-2-13">And again:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Heb-2-13"><span class="oblique">&#8220;Here am I and the children whom God has given Me.&#8221;</span></span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Inasmuch then as the children have partaken of flesh and blood, He Himself likewise shared in the same, that through death He might destroy him who had the power of death, that is, the devil, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and release those who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>For indeed He does not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>give aid to angels, but He does <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>give aid to the seed of Abraham. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Therefore, in all things He had to be made like <i>His</i> brethren, that He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things <i>pertaining</i> to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>For in that He Himself has suffered, being <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>tempted, He is able to aid those who are tempted.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-29979a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Hebrews 2:1">Hebrews 2:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>all the more careful attention</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29980b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Hebrews 2:2">Hebrews 2:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>retribution</i> or <i>penalty</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29982c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Hebrews 2:4">Hebrews 2:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>distributions</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29985d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Hebrews 2:7">Hebrews 2:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>for a little while</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29985e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Hebrews 2:7">Hebrews 2:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M omit the rest of v. <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Heb.2.7" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=Heb.2.7&amp;version=NKJV">7</span>.</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29987f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Hebrews 2:9">Hebrews 2:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>for a little while</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29989g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Hebrews 2:11">Hebrews 2:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>sets apart</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29994h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Hebrews 2:16">Hebrews 2:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>take on</i> the nature of</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29994i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Hebrews 2:16">Hebrews 2:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>take on</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29996j"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Hebrews 2:18">Hebrews 2:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>tested</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
