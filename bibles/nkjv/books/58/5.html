<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>He can <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>have compassion on those who are ignorant and going astray, since he himself is also subject to weakness. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Because of this he is required as for the people, so also for himself, to offer <i>sacrifices</i> for sins. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And no man takes this honor to himself, but he who is called by God, just as Aaron <i>was.</i></span></p> <h3>
A Priest Forever</span></h3><p><span class="text Heb-5-5"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So also Christ did not glorify Himself to become High Priest, but <i>it was</i> He who said to Him:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Heb-5-5"><span class="oblique">&#8220;You are My Son,</span></span><br /><span class="text Heb-5-5"><span class="oblique">Today I have begotten You.&#8221;</span></span></p></div> <p class="top-1">

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>who, in the days of His flesh, when He had offered up prayers and supplications, with vehement cries and tears to Him who was able to save Him from death, and was heard because of His godly fear, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>though He was a Son, <i>yet</i> He learned obedience by the things which He suffered. </span>
