<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>For a tabernacle was prepared: the first <i>part,</i> in which <i>was</i> the lampstand, the table, and the showbread, which is called the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>sanctuary; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and behind the second veil, the part of the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of All, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>which had the golden censer and the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold, in which <i>were</i> the golden pot that had the manna, Aaron&#8217;s rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. Of these things we cannot now speak in detail.</span></p> <h3>
Limitations of the Earthly Service</span></h3><p><span class="text Heb-9-6"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now when these things had been thus prepared, the priests always went into the first part of the tabernacle, performing the services. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But into the second part the high priest <i>went</i> alone once a year, not without blood, which he offered for himself and <i>for</i> the people&#8217;s sins <i>committed</i> in ignorance; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>the Holy Spirit indicating this, that the way into the Holiest of All was not yet made manifest while the first tabernacle was still standing. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>It <i>was</i> symbolic for the present time in which both gifts and sacrifices are offered which cannot make him who performed the service perfect in regard to the conscience&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><i>concerned</i> only with foods and drinks, various <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>washings, and fleshly ordinances imposed until the time of reformation.</span></p> <h3>
The Heavenly Sanctuary</span></h3><p><span class="text Heb-9-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But Christ came <i>as</i> High Priest of the good things <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>to come, with the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands, that is, not of this creation. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Not with the blood of goats and calves, but with His own blood He entered the Most Holy Place once for all, having obtained eternal redemption. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of a heifer, sprinkling the unclean, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>sanctifies for the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>purifying of the flesh, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>spot to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And for this reason He is the Mediator of the new covenant, by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, that those who are called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.</span></p> <h3>
The Mediator&#8217;s Death Necessary</span></h3><p><span class="text Heb-9-16"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>For where there <i>is</i> a testament, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>For a testament <i>is</i> in force after men are dead, since it has no power at all while the testator lives. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Therefore not even the first <i>covenant</i> was dedicated without blood. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>For when Moses had spoken every <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water, scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>saying, <span class="oblique">&#8220;This</span> <i>is</i> <span class="oblique">the</span> <span class="oblique">blood of the covenant which God has commanded you.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then likewise he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And according to the law almost all things are <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>purified with blood, and without shedding of blood there is no <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>remission.</span></p> <h3>
Greatness of Christ&#8217;s Sacrifice</span></h3><p><span class="text Heb-9-23"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Therefore <i>it was</i> necessary that the copies of the things in the heavens should be <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>purified with these, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>For Christ has not entered the holy places made with hands, <i>which are</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span>copies of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>not that He should offer Himself often, as the high priest enters the Most Holy Place every year with blood of another&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>He then would have had to suffer often since the foundation of the world; but now, once at the end of the ages, He has appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And as it is appointed for men to die once, but after this the judgment, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>so Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many. To those who eagerly wait for Him He will appear a second time, apart from sin, for salvation.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-30108a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Hebrews 9:2">Hebrews 9:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>holy place,</i> lit. <i>holies</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30116b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Hebrews 9:10">Hebrews 9:10</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>baptisms</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30117c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Hebrews 9:11">Hebrews 9:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>that have come</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30119d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Hebrews 9:13">Hebrews 9:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>sets apart</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30119e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Hebrews 9:13">Hebrews 9:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>cleansing</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30120f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Hebrews 9:14">Hebrews 9:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>blemish</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30125g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Hebrews 9:19">Hebrews 9:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>command</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30128h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Hebrews 9:22">Hebrews 9:22</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>cleansed</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30128i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Hebrews 9:22">Hebrews 9:22</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>forgiveness</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30129j"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Hebrews 9:23">Hebrews 9:23</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>cleansed</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30130k"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Hebrews 9:24">Hebrews 9:24</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>representations</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
