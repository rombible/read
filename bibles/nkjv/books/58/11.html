<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>For by it the elders obtained a <i>good</i> testimony.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>By faith we understand that the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>worlds were framed by the word of God, so that the things which are seen were not made of things which are visible.</span></p> <h3>
Faith at the Dawn of History</span></h3><p><span class="text Heb-11-4"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts; and through it he being dead still speaks.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>By faith Enoch was taken away so that he did not see death, <span class="oblique">&#8220;and was not found, because God had taken him&#8221;</span>; for before he was taken he had this testimony, that he pleased God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But without faith <i>it is</i> impossible to please <i>Him,</i> for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and <i>that</i> He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>By faith Noah, being divinely warned of things not yet seen, moved with godly fear, prepared an ark for the saving of his household, by which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.</span></p> <h3>
Faithful Abraham</span></h3><p><span class="text Heb-11-8"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to the place which he would receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he was going. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>By faith he dwelt in the land of promise as <i>in</i> a foreign country, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>for he waited for the city which has foundations, whose builder and maker <i>is</i> God.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>By faith Sarah herself also received strength to conceive seed, and she<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span> bore a child when she was past the age, because she judged Him faithful who had promised. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Therefore from one man, and him as good as dead, were born <i>as many</i> as the stars of the sky in multitude&#8212;innumerable as the sand which is by the seashore.</span></p> <h3>
The Heavenly Hope</span></h3><p><span class="text Heb-11-13"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>were assured of them, embraced <i>them</i> and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For those who say such things declare plainly that they seek a homeland. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And truly if they had called to mind that <i>country</i> from which they had come out, they would have had opportunity to return. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But now they desire a better, that is, a heavenly <i>country.</i> Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for He has prepared a city for them.</span></p> <h3>
The Faith of the Patriarchs</span></h3><p><span class="text Heb-11-17"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises offered up his only begotten <i>son,</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>of whom it was said, <span class="oblique">&#8220;In Isaac your seed shall be called,&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>concluding that God <i>was</i> able to raise <i>him</i> up, even from the dead, from which he also received him in a figurative sense.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped, <i>leaning</i> on the top of his staff.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>By faith Joseph, when he was dying, made mention of the departure of the children of Israel, and gave instructions concerning his bones.</span></p> <h3>
The Faith of Moses</span></h3><p><span class="text Heb-11-23"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden three months by his parents, because they saw <i>he was</i> a beautiful child; and they were not afraid of the king&#8217;s command.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>By faith Moses, when he became of age, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>passing pleasures of sin, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>esteeming the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>in Egypt; for he looked to the reward.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured as seeing Him who is invisible. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood, lest he who destroyed the firstborn should touch them.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>By faith they passed through the Red Sea as by dry <i>land, whereas</i> the Egyptians, attempting to do so, were drowned.</span></p> <h3>
By Faith They Overcame</span></h3><p><span class="text Heb-11-30"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they were encircled for seven days. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>By faith the harlot Rahab did not perish with those who <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>did not believe, when she had received the spies with peace.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And what more shall I say? For the time would fail me to tell of Gideon and Barak and Samson and Jephthah, also <i>of</i> David and Samuel and the prophets: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>who through faith subdued kingdoms, worked righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, became valiant in battle, turned to flight the armies of the aliens. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Women received their dead raised to life again.</span></p><p><span class="text Heb-11-35">Others were tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Still others had trial of mockings and scourgings, yes, and of chains and imprisonment. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>They were stoned, they were sawn in two, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span>were tempted, were slain with the sword.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>of whom the world was not worthy. They wandered in deserts and mountains, <i>in</i> dens and caves of the earth.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>And all these, having obtained a good testimony through faith, did not receive the promise, </span>
