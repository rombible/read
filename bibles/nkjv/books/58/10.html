<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>For then would they not have ceased to be offered? For the worshipers, once <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>purified, would have had no more consciousness of sins. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But in those <i>sacrifices there is</i> a reminder of sins every year. </span>

Christ&#8217;s Death Fulfills God&#8217;s Will</span></h3><p><span class="text Heb-10-5"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Therefore, when He came into the world, He said:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Heb-10-5"><span class="oblique">&#8220;Sacrifice and offering You did not desire,</span></span><br /><span class="text Heb-10-5"><span class="oblique">But a body You have prepared for Me.</span></span><br />

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>then He said, <span class="oblique">&#8220;Behold, I have come to do Your will,</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span><span class="oblique">O God.&#8221;</span> He takes away the first that He may establish the second. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>By that will we have been <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once <i>for all.</i></span></p> <h3>
Christ&#8217;s Death Perfects the Sanctified</span></h3><p><span class="text Heb-10-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And every priest stands ministering daily and offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But this Man, after He had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down at the right hand of God, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>from that time waiting till His enemies are made His footstool. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For by one offering He has perfected forever those who are being <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>sanctified.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But the Holy Spirit also witnesses to us; for after He had said before,</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span><span class="oblique">&#8220;This</span> <i>is</i> <span class="oblique">the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the</span> <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span><span class="oblique">: I will put My laws into their hearts, and in their minds I will write them,&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span><i>then He adds,</i> <span class="oblique">&#8220;Their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Now where there is <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>remission of these, <i>there is</i> no longer an offering for sin.</span></p> <h3>
Hold Fast Your Confession</span></h3><p><span class="text Heb-10-19"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Therefore, brethren, having boldness<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span> to enter the Holiest by the blood of Jesus, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>by a new and living way which He consecrated for us, through the veil, that is, His flesh, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>and <i>having</i> a High Priest over the house of God, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Let us hold fast the confession of <i>our</i> hope without wavering, for He who promised <i>is</i> faithful. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And let us consider one another in order to stir up love and good works, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as <i>is</i> the manner of some, but exhorting <i>one another,</i> and so much the more as you see the Day approaching.</span></p> <h3>
The Just Live by Faith</span></h3><p><span class="text Heb-10-26"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and fiery indignation which will devour the adversaries. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Anyone who has rejected Moses&#8217; law dies without mercy on <i>the testimony of</i> two or three witnesses. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Of how much worse punishment, do you suppose, will he be thought worthy who has trampled the Son of God underfoot, counted the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified a common thing, and insulted the Spirit of grace? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>For we know Him who said, <span class="oblique">&#8220;Vengeance is Mine, I will repay,&#8221;</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>says the Lord. And again, <span class="oblique">&#8220;The</span> <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <span class="oblique">will judge His people.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>But recall the former days in which, after you were <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>illuminated, you endured a great struggle with sufferings: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>partly while you were made a spectacle both by reproaches and tribulations, and partly while you became companions of those who were so treated; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>for you had compassion on <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>me in my chains, and joyfully accepted the plundering of your <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>goods, knowing that you have a better and an enduring possession for yourselves <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span>in heaven. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Therefore do not cast away your confidence, which has great reward. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>For you have need of endurance, so that after you have done the will of God, you may receive the promise:</span></p> <div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line">
