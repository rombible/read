<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>looking unto Jesus, the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>author and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>finisher of <i>our</i> faith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.</span></p> <h3>
The Discipline of God</span></h3><p><span class="text Heb-12-3"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For consider Him who endured such hostility from sinners against Himself, lest you become weary and discouraged in your souls. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>You have not yet resisted to bloodshed, striving against sin. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And you have forgotten the exhortation which speaks to you as to sons:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Heb-12-5"><span class="oblique">&#8220;My son, do not despise the</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span><span class="oblique">chastening of the</span> <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span><span class="oblique">,</span></span><br /><span class="text Heb-12-5"><span class="oblique">Nor be discouraged when you are rebuked by Him;</span></span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span><span class="oblique">For</span> <span class="oblique">whom the</span> <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <span class="oblique">loves He chastens,</span></span><br /><span class="text Heb-12-6"><span class="oblique">And scourges every son whom He receives.&#8221;</span></span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>If<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span> you endure chastening, God deals with you as with sons; for what son is there whom a father does not chasten? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But if you are without chastening, of which all have become partakers, then you are illegitimate and not sons. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Furthermore, we have had human fathers who corrected <i>us,</i> and we paid <i>them</i> respect. Shall we not much more readily be in subjection to the Father of spirits and live? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For they indeed for a few days chastened <i>us</i> as seemed <i>best</i> to them, but He for <i>our</i> profit, that <i>we</i> may be partakers of His holiness. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now no <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>chastening seems to be joyful for the present, but painful; nevertheless, afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.</span></p> <h3>
Renew Your Spiritual Vitality</span></h3><p><span class="text Heb-12-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Therefore strengthen the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be dislocated, but rather be healed.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Pursue peace with all <i>people,</i> and holiness, without which no one will see the Lord: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>looking carefully lest anyone fall short of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up cause trouble, and by this many become defiled; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>lest there <i>be</i> any fornicator or <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>profane person like Esau, who for one morsel of food sold his birthright. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>For you know that afterward, when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for repentance, though he sought it diligently with tears.</span></p> <h3>
The Glorious Company</span></h3><p><span class="text Heb-12-18"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>For you have not come <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>to the mountain that may be touched and that burned with fire, and to blackness and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>darkness and tempest, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words, so that those who heard <i>it</i> begged that the word should not be spoken to them anymore. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>(For they could not endure what was commanded: <span class="oblique">&#8220;And if so much as a beast touches the mountain, it shall be stoned</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span><span class="oblique">or shot with an arrow.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And so terrifying was the sight <i>that</i> Moses said, <span class="oblique">&#8220;I am exceedingly afraid</span> and trembling.&#8221;)</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, to an innumerable company of angels, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>to the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>general assembly and church of the firstborn <i>who are</i> registered in heaven, to God the Judge of all, to the spirits of just men made perfect, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>to Jesus the Mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better things than <i>that of</i> Abel.</span></p> <h3>
Hear the Heavenly Voice</span></h3><p><span class="text Heb-12-25"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>See that you do not refuse Him who speaks. For if they did not escape who refused Him who spoke on earth, much more <i>shall we not escape</i> if we turn away from Him who <i>speaks</i> from heaven, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>whose voice then shook the earth; but now He has promised, saying, <span class="oblique">&#8220;Yet once more I</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span><span class="oblique">shake not only the earth, but also heaven.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Now this, <span class="oblique">&#8220;Yet once more,&#8221;</span> indicates the removal of those things that are being shaken, as of things that are made, that the things which cannot be shaken may remain.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us have grace, by which we <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[l]</a></span>may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear. </span>
