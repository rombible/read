Concluding Religious Directions</span></h3><p><span class="text Heb-13-7"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Remember those who <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>rule over you, who have spoken the word of God to you, whose faith follow, considering the outcome of <i>their</i> conduct. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Jesus Christ <i>is</i> the same yesterday, today, and forever. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Do not be carried <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>about with various and strange doctrines. For <i>it is</i> good that the heart be established by grace, not with foods which have not profited those who have been occupied with them.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>We have an altar from which those who serve the tabernacle have no right to eat. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For the bodies of those animals, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned outside the camp. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Therefore Jesus also, that He might <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>sanctify the people with His own blood, suffered outside the gate. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Therefore let us go forth to Him, outside the camp, bearing His reproach. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For here we have no continuing city, but we seek the one to come. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Therefore by Him let us continually offer the sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of <i>our</i> lips, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>giving thanks to His name. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But do not forget to do good and to share, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Obey those who <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>rule over you, and be submissive, for they watch out for your souls, as those who must give account. Let them do so with joy and not with grief, for that would be unprofitable for you.</span></p> <h3>
Prayer Requested</span></h3><p><span class="text Heb-13-18"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Pray for us; for we are confident that we have a good conscience, in all things desiring to live honorably. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>But I especially urge <i>you</i> to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.</span></p> <h3>
