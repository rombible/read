<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>For indeed the gospel was preached to us as well as to them; but the word which they heard did not profit them, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>not being mixed with faith in those who heard <i>it.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For we who have believed do enter that rest, as He has said:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Heb-4-3"><span class="oblique">&#8220;So I swore in My wrath,</span></span><br /><span class="text Heb-4-3"><span class="oblique">&#8216;They shall not enter My rest,&#8217; &#8221;</span></span></p></div><p class="first-line-none top-1"><span class="text Heb-4-3">although the works were finished from the foundation of the world. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For He has spoken in a certain place of the seventh <i>day</i> in this way: <span class="oblique">&#8220;And God rested on the seventh day from all His works&#8221;</span>; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and again in this <i>place:</i> <span class="oblique">&#8220;They shall not enter My rest.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Since therefore it remains that some <i>must</i> enter it, and those to whom it was first preached did not enter because of disobedience, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>again He designates a certain day, saying in David, <span class="oblique">&#8220;Today,&#8221;</span> after such a long time, as it has been said:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Heb-4-7"><span class="oblique">&#8220;Today, if you will hear His voice,</span></span><br /><span class="text Heb-4-7"><span class="oblique">Do not harden your hearts.&#8221;</span></span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For if <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>Joshua had given them rest, then He would not afterward have spoken of another day. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>There remains therefore a rest for the people of God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For he who has entered His rest has himself also ceased from his works as God <i>did</i> from His.</span></p> <h3>
The Word Discovers Our Condition</span></h3><p><span class="text Heb-4-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Let us therefore be diligent to enter that rest, lest anyone fall according to the same example of disobedience. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>For the word of God <i>is</i> living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things <i>are</i> naked and open to the eyes of Him to whom we <i>must give</i> account.</span></p> <h3>
Our Compassionate High Priest</span></h3><p><span class="text Heb-4-14"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Seeing then that we have a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast <i>our</i> confession. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all <i>points</i> tempted as <i>we are,</i> <i>yet</i> without sin. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-30017a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Hebrews 4:2">Hebrews 4:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M <i>since they were not united by faith with those who heeded it</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30023b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Hebrews 4:8">Hebrews 4:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Gr. <i>Jesus,</i> same as Heb. <i>Joshua</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
