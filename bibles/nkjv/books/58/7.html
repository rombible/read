<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all, first being translated &#8220;king of righteousness,&#8221; and then also king of Salem, meaning &#8220;king of peace,&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, remains a priest continually.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Now consider how great this man <i>was,</i> to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>spoils. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And indeed those who are of the sons of Levi, who receive the priesthood, have a commandment to receive tithes from the people according to the law, that is, from their brethren, though they have come from the loins of Abraham; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>but he whose genealogy is not derived from them received tithes from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now beyond all contradiction the lesser is blessed by the better. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Here mortal men receive tithes, but there he <i>receives them,</i> of whom it is witnessed that he lives. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Even Levi, who receives tithes, paid tithes through Abraham, so to speak, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>for he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.</span></p> <h3>
Need for a New Priesthood</span></h3><p><span class="text Heb-7-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Therefore, if perfection were through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law), what further need <i>was there</i> that another priest should rise according to the order of Melchizedek, and not be called according to the order of Aaron? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>For the priesthood being changed, of necessity there is also a change of the law. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For He of whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe, from which no man has <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>officiated at the altar.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For <i>it is</i> evident that our Lord arose from Judah, of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>priesthood. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And it is yet far more evident if, in the likeness of Melchizedek, there arises another priest </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>who has come, not according to the law of a fleshly commandment, but according to the power of an endless life. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>For <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>He testifies:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Heb-7-17"><span class="oblique">&#8220;You</span> <i>are</i> <span class="oblique">a priest forever</span></span><br /><span class="text Heb-7-17"><span class="oblique">According to the order of Melchizedek.&#8221;</span></span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>For on the one hand there is an annulling of the former commandment because of its weakness and unprofitableness, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>for the law made nothing <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>perfect; on the other hand, <i>there is the</i> bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God.</span></p> <h3>
Greatness of the New Priest</span></h3><p><span class="text Heb-7-20"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And inasmuch as <i>He was</i> not <i>made priest</i> without an oath </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>(for they have become priests without an oath, but He with an oath by Him who said to Him:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Heb-7-21"><span class="oblique">&#8220;The</span> <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <span class="oblique">has sworn</span></span><br /><span class="text Heb-7-21"><span class="oblique">And will not relent,</span></span><br /><span class="text Heb-7-21"><span class="oblique">&#8216;You</span> <i>are</i> <span class="oblique">a priest</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span><span class="oblique">forever</span></span><br /><span class="text Heb-7-21"><span class="oblique">According to the order of Melchizedek&#8217; &#8221;</span>),</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>by so much more Jesus has become a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>surety of a better covenant.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Also there were many priests, because they were prevented by death from continuing. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>But He, because He continues forever, has an unchangeable priesthood. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Therefore He is also able to save <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>to the uttermost those who come to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>For such a High Priest was fitting for us, <i>who is</i> holy, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and has become higher than the heavens; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>who does not need daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for His own sins and then for the people&#8217;s, for this He did once for all when He offered up Himself. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>For the law appoints as high priests men who have weakness, but the word of the oath, which came after the law, <i>appoints</i> the Son who has been perfected forever.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-30069a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Hebrews 7:4">Hebrews 7:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>plunder</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30078b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Hebrews 7:13">Hebrews 7:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>served</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30079c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Hebrews 7:14">Hebrews 7:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>priests</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30082d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Hebrews 7:17">Hebrews 7:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>it is testified</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30084e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Hebrews 7:19">Hebrews 7:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>complete</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30086f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Hebrews 7:21">Hebrews 7:21</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU ends the quotation after <i>forever.</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30087g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Hebrews 7:22">Hebrews 7:22</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>guarantee</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30090h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Hebrews 7:25">Hebrews 7:25</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>completely</i> or <i>forever</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30091i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Hebrews 7:26">Hebrews 7:26</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>innocent</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
