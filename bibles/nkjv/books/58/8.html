<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>a Minister of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the Lord erected, and not man.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. Therefore <i>it is</i> necessary that this One also have something to offer. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For if He were on earth, He would not be a priest, since there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>who serve the copy and shadow of the heavenly things, as Moses was divinely instructed when he was about to make the tabernacle. For He said, <span class="oblique">&#8220;See</span> <i>that</i> <span class="oblique">you make all things according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry, inasmuch as He is also Mediator of a better covenant, which was established on better promises.</span></p> <h3>
A New Covenant</span></h3><p><span class="text Heb-8-7"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For if that first <i>covenant</i> had been faultless, then no place would have been sought for a second. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Because finding fault with them, He says: <span class="oblique">&#8220;Behold, the days are coming, says the</span> <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span><span class="oblique">, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah</span>&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span><span class="oblique">not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they did not continue in My covenant, and I disregarded them, says the</span> <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span><span class="oblique">.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><span class="oblique">For this</span> <i>is</i> <span class="oblique">the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the</span> <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span><span class="oblique">: I will put My laws in their mind and write them on their hearts; and</span> <span class="oblique">I will be their God, and they shall be My people.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span><span class="oblique">None of them shall teach his neighbor, and none his brother, saying, &#8216;Know the</span> <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span><span class="oblique">,&#8217; for all shall know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span><span class="oblique">For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness,</span> <span class="oblique">and their sins</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span><span class="oblique">and their lawless deeds I will remember no more.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>In that He says, &#8220;<span class="oblique">A new</span> <i>covenant</i>,&#8221; He has made the first obsolete. Now what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-30095a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Hebrews 8:2">Hebrews 8:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>holies</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30105b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Hebrews 8:12">Hebrews 8:12</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>and their lawless deeds</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
