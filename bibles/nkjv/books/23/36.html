<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then the king of Assyria sent <i>the</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>Rabshakeh with a great army from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. And he stood by the aqueduct from the upper pool, on the highway to the Fuller&#8217;s Field. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came out to him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then <i>the</i> Rabshakeh said to them, &#8220;Say now to Hezekiah, &#8216;Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria: &#8220;What confidence is this in which you trust? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>I say you speak of having plans and power for war; but <i>they are</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>mere words. Now in whom do you trust, that you rebel against me? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Look! You are trusting in the staff of this broken reed, Egypt, on which if a man leans, it will go into his hand and pierce it. So <i>is</i> Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8220;But if you say to me, &#8216;We trust in the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God,&#8217; <i>is it</i> not He whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and said to Judah and Jerusalem, &#8216;You shall worship before this altar&#8217;?&#8221; &#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Now therefore, I urge you, give a pledge to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses&#8212;if you are able on your part to put riders on them! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>How then will you repel one captain of the least of my master&#8217;s servants, and put your trust in Egypt for chariots and horsemen? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Have I now come up without the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> against this land to destroy it? The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to me, &#8216;Go up against this land, and destroy it.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to <i>the</i> Rabshakeh, &#8220;Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand <i>it;</i> and do not speak to us in <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Hebrew in the hearing of the people who <i>are</i> on the wall.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But <i>the</i> Rabshakeh said, &#8220;Has my master sent me to your master and to you to speak these words, and not to the men who sit on the wall, who will eat and drink their own waste with you?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then <i>the</i> Rabshakeh stood and called out with a loud voice in Hebrew, and said, &#8220;Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Thus says the king: &#8216;Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>nor let Hezekiah make you trust in the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, saying, &#8220;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will surely deliver us; this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.&#8221; &#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Do not listen to Hezekiah; for thus says the king of Assyria: &#8216;Make <i>peace</i> with me <i>by a</i> present and come out to me; and every one of you eat from his own vine and every one from his own fig tree, and every one of you drink the waters of his own cistern; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span><i>Beware</i> lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, &#8220;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will deliver us.&#8221; Has any one of the gods of the nations delivered its land from the hand of the king of Assyria? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Where <i>are</i> the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where <i>are</i> the gods of Sepharvaim? Indeed, have they delivered Samaria from my hand? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Who among all the gods of these lands have delivered their countries from my hand, that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> should deliver Jerusalem from my hand?&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>But they <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>held their peace and answered him not a word; for the king&#8217;s commandment was, &#8220;Do not answer him.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who <i>was</i> over the household, Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with <i>their</i> clothes torn, and told him the words of <i>the</i> Rabshakeh.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-18333a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Isaiah 36:2">Isaiah 36:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'>A title, probably <i>Chief of Staff</i> or <i>Governor</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-18336b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Isaiah 36:5">Isaiah 36:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>a word of the lips</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-18342c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Isaiah 36:11">Isaiah 36:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Judean</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-18352d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Isaiah 36:21">Isaiah 36:21</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>were silent</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
