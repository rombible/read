<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then he sent Eliakim, who <i>was</i> over the household, Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And they said to him, &#8220;Thus says Hezekiah: &#8216;This day <i>is</i> a day of trouble and rebuke and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>blasphemy; for the children have come to birth, but <i>there is</i> no strength to bring them forth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>It may be that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God will hear the words of <i>the</i> Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to reproach the living God, and will rebuke the words which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God has heard.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And Isaiah said to them, &#8220;Thus you shall say to your master, &#8216;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8220;Do not be afraid of the words which you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Surely I will send a spirit upon him, and he shall hear a rumor and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.&#8221; &#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <h3>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And the king heard concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, &#8220;He has come out to make war with you.&#8221; So when he heard <i>it,</i> he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8220;Thus you shall speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying: &#8216;Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, &#8220;Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Look! You have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by utterly destroying them; and shall you be delivered? </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up to the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and spread it before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then Hezekiah prayed to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, saying: </span>
