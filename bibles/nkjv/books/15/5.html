<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>Jozadak rose up and began to build the house of God which <i>is</i> in Jerusalem; and the prophets of God <i>were</i> with them, helping them.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>At the same time Tattenai the governor of <i>the region</i> beyond <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>the River and Shethar-Boznai and their companions came to them and spoke thus to them: &#8220;Who has commanded you to build this <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>temple and finish this wall?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then, accordingly, we told them the names of the men who were constructing this building. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, so that they could not make them cease till a report could go to Darius. Then a written answer was returned concerning this <i>matter.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>This is a copy of the letter that Tattenai sent:</span></p><div class="left-1 top-1"><p class="first-line-none"><span class="text Ezra-5-6">The governor of <i>the region</i> beyond the River, and Shethar-Boznai, and his companions, the Persians who <i>were in the region</i> beyond the River, to Darius the king.</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>(They sent a letter to him, in which was written thus.)</span></p><div class="left-1 top-1"><p class="first-line-none"><span class="text Ezra-5-7">To Darius the king:</span></p></div> <div class="left-1 top-1"><p class="first-line-none"><span class="text Ezra-5-7">All peace.</span></p></div> <div class="left-1 top-1"><p class="first-line-none">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Let it be known to the king that we went into the province of Judea, to the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>temple of the great God, which is being built with <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>heavy stones, and timber is being laid in the walls; and this work goes on diligently and prospers in their hands.</span></p></div> <div class="left-1 top-1"><p class="first-line-none">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then we asked those elders, <i>and</i> spoke thus to them: &#8220;Who commanded you to build this temple and to finish these walls?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>We also asked them their names to inform you, that we might write the names of the men who <i>were</i> chief among them.</span></p></div> <div class="left-1 top-1"><p class="first-line-none">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And thus they returned us an answer, saying: &#8220;We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are rebuilding the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>temple that was built many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and completed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But because our fathers provoked the God of heaven to wrath, He gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, <i>who</i> destroyed this temple and carried the people away to Babylon. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/5-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>However, in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, King Cyrus issued a decree to build this <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>house of God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/5-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Also, the gold and silver articles of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple that <i>was</i> in Jerusalem and carried into the temple of Babylon&#8212;those King Cyrus took from the temple of Babylon, and they were given to one named Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/5-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And he said to him, &#8216;Take these articles; go, carry them to the temple <i>site</i> that <i>is</i> in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be rebuilt on its former site.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/5-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then the same Sheshbazzar came <i>and</i> laid the foundation of the house of God which <i>is</i> in Jerusalem; but from that time even until now it has been under construction, and it is not finished.&#8221;</span></p></div> <div class="left-1 top-1"><p class="first-line-none">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/5-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Now therefore, if <i>it seems</i> good to the king, let a search be made in the king&#8217;s treasure house, which <i>is</i> there in Babylon, whether it is <i>so</i> that a decree was issued by King Cyrus to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send us his pleasure concerning this <i>matter.</i></span></p></div> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-12137a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezra 5:2">Ezra 5:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Jehozadak,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="1Chr.6.14" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=1Chr.6.14&amp;version=NKJV">1 Chr. 6:14</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12138b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezra 5:3">Ezra 5:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>The Euphrates</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12138c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezra 5:3">Ezra 5:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>house</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12143d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezra 5:8">Ezra 5:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>house</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12143e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezra 5:8">Ezra 5:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>stones of rolling,</i> stones too heavy to be carried</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12146f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezra 5:11">Ezra 5:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>house</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12148g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezra 5:13">Ezra 5:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Temple</span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
