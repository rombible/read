<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>For they have taken some of their daughters <i>as wives</i> for themselves and their sons, so that the holy seed is mixed with the peoples of <i>those</i> lands. Indeed, the hand of the leaders and rulers has been foremost in this <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>trespass.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So when I heard this thing, I tore my garment and my robe, and plucked out some of the hair of my head and beard, and sat down astonished. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel assembled to me, because of the transgression of those who had been carried away captive, and I sat astonished until the evening sacrifice.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>At the evening sacrifice I arose from my fasting; and having torn my garment and my robe, I fell on my knees and spread out my hands to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> my God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And I said: &#8220;O my God, I am too ashamed and humiliated to lift up my face to You, my God; for our iniquities have risen higher than <i>our</i> heads, and our guilt has grown up to the heavens. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Since the days of our fathers to this day we <i>have been</i> very guilty, and for our iniquities we, our kings, <i>and</i> our priests have been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, to plunder, and to humiliation,<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span> as <i>it is</i> this day. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And now for a little while grace has been <i>shown</i> from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a peg in His holy place, that our God may enlighten our eyes and give us a measure of revival in our bondage. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For we <i>were</i> slaves. Yet our God did not forsake us in our bondage; but He extended mercy to us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to revive us, to repair the house of our God, to rebuild its ruins, and to give us a wall in Judah and Jerusalem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? For we have forsaken Your commandments, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>which You commanded by Your servants the prophets, saying, &#8216;The land which you are entering to possess is an unclean land, with the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands, with their abominations which have filled it from one end to another with their impurity. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now therefore, do not give your daughters as wives for their sons, nor take their daughters to your sons; and never seek their peace or prosperity, that you may be strong and eat the good of the land, and leave <i>it</i> as an inheritance to your children forever.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And after all that has come upon us for our evil deeds and for our great guilt, since You our God have punished us less than our iniquities <i>deserve,</i> and have given us <i>such</i> deliverance as this, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>should we again break Your commandments, and join in marriage with the people <i>committing</i> these abominations? Would You not be angry with us until You had <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>consumed <i>us,</i> so that <i>there would be</i> no remnant or survivor? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel, You <i>are</i> righteous, for we are left as a remnant, as <i>it is</i> this day. Here we <i>are</i> before You, in our guilt, though no one can stand before You because of this!&#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-12240a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezra 9:2">Ezra 9:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>unfaithfulness</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12245b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezra 9:7">Ezra 9:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>shame of faces</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12252c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezra 9:14">Ezra 9:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>destroyed</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
