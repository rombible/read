<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>In the first year of King Cyrus, King Cyrus issued a decree <i>concerning</i> the house of God at Jerusalem: &#8220;Let the house be rebuilt, the place where they offered sacrifices; and let the foundations of it be firmly laid, its height sixty cubits <i>and</i> its width sixty cubits, </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God on its site.</span></p></div> <div class="left-1 top-1"><p class="first-line-none">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Moreover I issue a decree <i>as to</i> what you shall do for the elders of these Jews, for the building of this <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>house of God: Let the cost be paid at the king&#8217;s expense from taxes <i>on the region</i> beyond the River; this is to be given immediately to these men, so that they are not hindered. </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/6-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Now the temple was finished on the third day of the month of Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of King Darius. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/6-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then the children of Israel, the priests and the Levites and the rest of the descendants of the captivity, celebrated the dedication of this <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>house of God with joy. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/6-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And they offered sacrifices at the dedication of this house of God, one hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs, and as a sin offering for all Israel twelve male goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel. </span>
