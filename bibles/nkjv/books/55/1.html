Timothy&#8217;s Faith and Heritage</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Tim-1-3"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>I thank God, whom I serve with a pure conscience, as <i>my</i> forefathers <i>did,</i> as without ceasing I remember you in my prayers night and day, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>greatly desiring to see you, being mindful of your tears, that I may be filled with joy, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>when I call to remembrance the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>genuine faith that is in you, which dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am persuaded is in you also. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Therefore I remind you to stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.</span></p> <h3>
Not Ashamed of the Gospel</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Tim-1-8"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me His prisoner, but share with me in the sufferings for the gospel according to the power of God, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>who has saved us and called <i>us</i> with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace which was given to us in Christ Jesus before time began, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, <i>who</i> has abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>to which I was appointed a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>of the Gentiles. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>For this reason I also suffer these things; nevertheless I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that He is able to keep what I have committed to Him until that Day.</span></p> <h3>
Be Loyal to the Faith</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Tim-1-13"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Hold fast the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which are in Christ Jesus. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>That good thing which was committed to you, keep by the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.</span></p> <p>
