<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Preach the word! Be ready in season <i>and</i> out of season. Convince, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their own desires, <i>because</i> they have itching ears, they will heap up for themselves teachers; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and they will turn <i>their</i> ears away from the truth, and be turned aside to fables. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But you be watchful in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.</span></p> <h3>
Paul&#8217;s Valedictory</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Tim-4-6"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure is at hand. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Finally, there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will give to me on that Day, and not to me only but also to all who have loved His appearing.</span></p> <h3>
The Abandoned Apostle</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Tim-4-9"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Be diligent to come to me quickly; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>for Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present world, and has departed for Thessalonica&#8212;Crescens for Galatia, Titus for Dalmatia. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for ministry. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas when you come&#8212;and the books, especially the parchments.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Alexander the coppersmith did me much harm. May the Lord repay him according to his works. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>You also must beware of him, for he has greatly resisted our words.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>At my first defense no one stood with me, but all forsook me. May it not be charged against them.</span></p> <h3>
The Lord Is Faithful</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Tim-4-17"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But the Lord stood with me and strengthened me, so that the message might be preached fully through me, and <i>that</i> all the Gentiles might hear. Also I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work and preserve <i>me</i> for His heavenly kingdom. To Him <i>be</i> glory forever and ever. Amen!</span></p> <h3>
