<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>unloving, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, brutal, despisers of good, </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>having a form of godliness but denying its power. And from such people turn away! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>For of this sort are those who creep into households and make captives of gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Now as Jannes and Jambres resisted Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, disapproved concerning the faith; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>but they will progress no further, for their folly will be manifest to all, as theirs also was.</span></p> <h3>
