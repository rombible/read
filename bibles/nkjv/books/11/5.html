<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then Solomon sent to Hiram, saying:</span></p> <div class="left-1 top-1"><p class="first-line-none">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>You know how my father David could not build a house for the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> his God because of the wars which were fought against him on every side, until the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> put <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span><i>his foes</i> under the soles of his feet.</span></p> <p class="first-line-none">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But now the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> my God has given me rest<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span> on every side; <i>there is</i> neither adversary nor <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>evil occurrence.</span></p> <p class="first-line-none">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And behold, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>I propose to build a house for the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> my God, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to my father David, saying, &#8220;Your son, whom I will set on your throne in your place, he shall build the house for My name.&#8221;</span></p> <p class="first-line-none">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now therefore, command that they cut down cedars for me from Lebanon; and my servants will be with your servants, and I will pay you wages for your servants according to whatever you say. For you know <i>there is</i> none among us who has skill to cut timber like the Sidonians.</span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So it was, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly and said,</span></p><div class="left-1 top-1"><p class="first-line-none"><span class="text 1Kgs-5-7">Blessed <i>be</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> this day, for He has given David a wise son over this great people!</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then Hiram sent to Solomon, saying:</span></p><div class="left-1 top-1"><p class="first-line-none"><span class="text 1Kgs-5-8">I have considered <i>the message</i> which you sent me, <i>and</i> I will do all you desire concerning the cedar and cypress logs.</span></p> <p class="first-line-none">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>My servants shall bring <i>them</i> down from Lebanon to the sea; I will float them in rafts by sea to the place you indicate to me, and will have them broken apart there; then you can take <i>them</i> away. And you shall fulfill my desire by giving food for my household.</span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then Hiram gave Solomon cedar and cypress logs <i>according to</i> all his desire. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>kors of wheat <i>as</i> food for his household, and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>twenty kors of pressed oil. Thus Solomon gave to Hiram year by year.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> gave Solomon wisdom, as He had promised him; and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and the two of them made a treaty together.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then King Solomon raised up a labor force out of all Israel; and the labor force was thirty thousand men. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month in shifts: they were one month in Lebanon <i>and</i> two months at home; Adoniram <i>was</i> in charge of the labor force. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Solomon had seventy thousand who carried burdens, and eighty thousand who quarried <i>stone</i> in the mountains, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>besides three thousand <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>three hundred from the chiefs of Solomon&#8217;s deputies, who supervised the people who labored in the work. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And the king commanded them to quarry large stones, costly stones, <i>and</i> hewn stones, to lay the foundation of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>temple. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>So Solomon&#8217;s builders, Hiram&#8217;s builders, and the Gebalites quarried <i>them;</i> and they prepared timber and stones to build the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>temple.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-8882a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 5:3">1 Kings 5:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>them</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8883b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 5:4">1 Kings 5:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>peace</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8883c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 5:4">1 Kings 5:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>misfortune</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8884d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 5:5">1 Kings 5:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>I am saying</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8890e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 5:11">1 Kings 5:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Each about 5 bushels</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8890f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 5:11">1 Kings 5:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>So with MT, Tg., Vg.; LXX, Syr. <i>twenty thousand kors</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8895g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 5:16">1 Kings 5:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>So with MT, Tg., Vg.; LXX <i>six hundred</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8896h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 5:17">1 Kings 5:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>house</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8897i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 5:18">1 Kings 5:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>house</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
