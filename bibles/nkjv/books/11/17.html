<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came to him, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8220;Get away from here and turn eastward, and hide by the Brook Cherith, which flows into the Jordan. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And it will be <i>that</i> you shall drink from the brook, and I have commanded the ravens to feed you there.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So he went and did according to the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, for he went and stayed by the Brook Cherith, which flows into the Jordan. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>The ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning, and bread and meat in the evening; and he drank from the brook. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And it happened after a while that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land.</span></p> <h3>
Elijah and the Widow</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Kgs-17-8"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came to him, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;Arise, go to Zarephath, which <i>belongs</i> to Sidon, and dwell there. See, I have commanded a widow there to provide for you.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, indeed a widow <i>was</i> there gathering sticks. And he called to her and said, &#8220;Please bring me a little water in a cup, that I may drink.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And as she was going to get <i>it,</i> he called to her and said, &#8220;Please bring me a morsel of bread in your hand.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So she said, &#8220;As the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God lives, I do not have bread, only a handful of flour in a bin, and a little oil in a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>jar; and see, I <i>am</i> gathering a couple of sticks that I may go in and prepare it for myself and my son, that we may eat it, and die.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And Elijah said to her, &#8220;Do not fear; go <i>and</i> do as you have said, but make me a small cake from it first, and bring <i>it</i> to me; and afterward make <i>some</i> for yourself and your son. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel: &#8216;The bin of flour shall not be used up, nor shall the jar of oil run dry, until the day the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> sends rain on the earth.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So she went away and did according to the word of Elijah; and she and he and her household ate for <i>many</i> days. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>The bin of flour was not used up, nor did the jar of oil run dry, according to the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> which He spoke by Elijah.</span></p> <h3>
Elijah Revives the Widow&#8217;s Son</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Kgs-17-17"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Now it happened after these things <i>that</i> the son of the woman who owned the house became sick. And his sickness was so <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>serious that <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>there was no breath left in him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>So she said to Elijah, &#8220;What have I to do with you, O man of God? Have you come to me to bring my sin to remembrance, and to kill my son?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And he said to her, &#8220;Give me your son.&#8221; So he took him out of her arms and carried him to the upper room where he was staying, and laid him on his own bed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then he cried out to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and said, &#8220;O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> my God, have You also brought tragedy on the widow with whom I lodge, by killing her son?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And he stretched himself out on the child three times, and cried out to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and said, &#8220;O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> my God, I pray, let this child&#8217;s soul come back to him.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came back to him, and he revived.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And Elijah took the child and brought him down from the upper room into the house, and gave him to his mother. And Elijah said, &#8220;See, your son lives!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then the woman said to Elijah, &#8220;Now by this I know that you <i>are</i> a man of God, <i>and</i> that the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> in your mouth <i>is</i> the truth.&#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-9330a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 17:12">1 Kings 17:12</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>pitcher</i> or <i>water jar</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9335b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 17:17">1 Kings 17:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>severe</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9335c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 17:17">1 Kings 17:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'>He died.</span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
