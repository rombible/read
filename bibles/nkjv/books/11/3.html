<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Meanwhile the people sacrificed at the high places, because there was no house built for the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> until those days. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And Solomon loved the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, walking in the statutes of his father David, except that he sacrificed and burned incense at the high places.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Now the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, for that <i>was</i> the great high place: Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>At Gibeon the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> appeared to Solomon in a dream by night; and God said, &#8220;Ask! What shall I give you?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And Solomon said: &#8220;You have shown great mercy to Your servant David my father, because he walked before You in truth, in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with You; You have continued this great kindness for him, and You have given him a son to sit on his throne, as <i>it is</i> this day. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> my God, You have made Your servant king instead of my father David, but I <i>am</i> a little child; I do not know <i>how</i> to go out or come in. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And Your servant <i>is</i> in the midst of Your people whom You have chosen, a great people, too numerous to be numbered or counted. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Therefore give to Your servant an <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>understanding heart to judge Your people, that I may discern between good and evil. For who is able to judge this great people of Yours?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>The speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then God said to him: &#8220;Because you have asked this thing, and have not asked long life for yourself, nor have asked riches for yourself, nor have asked the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to discern justice, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>behold, I have done according to your words; see, I have given you a wise and understanding heart, so that there has not been anyone like you before you, nor shall any like you arise after you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And I have also given you what you have not asked: both riches and honor, so that there shall not be anyone like you among the kings all your days. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So if you walk in My ways, to keep My statutes and My commandments, as your father David walked, then I will lengthen<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> your days.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then Solomon awoke; and indeed it had been a dream. And he came to Jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, offered up burnt offerings, offered peace offerings, and made a feast for all his servants.</span></p> <h3>
Solomon&#8217;s Wise Judgment</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Kgs-3-16"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Now two women <i>who were</i> harlots came to the king, and stood before him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And one woman said, &#8220;O my lord, this woman and I dwell in the same house; and I gave birth while she <i>was</i> in the house. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then it happened, the third day after I had given birth, that this woman also gave birth. And we <i>were</i> together; <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>no one <i>was</i> with us in the house, except the two of us in the house. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And this woman&#8217;s son died in the night, because she lay on him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So she arose in the middle of the night and took my son from my side, while your maidservant slept, and laid him in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And when I rose in the morning to nurse my son, there he was, dead. But when I had examined him in the morning, indeed, he was not my son whom I had borne.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then the other woman said, &#8220;No! But the living one <i>is</i> my son, and the dead one <i>is</i> your son.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Kgs-3-22">And the first woman said, &#8220;No! But the dead one <i>is</i> your son, and the living one <i>is</i> my son.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Kgs-3-22">Thus they spoke before the king.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And the king said, &#8220;The one says, &#8216;This <i>is</i> my son, who lives, and your son <i>is</i> the dead one&#8217;; and the other says, &#8216;No! But your son <i>is</i> the dead one, and my son <i>is</i> the living one.&#8217; &#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then the king said, &#8220;Bring me a sword.&#8221; So they brought a sword before the king. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And the king said, &#8220;Divide the living child in two, and give half to one, and half to the other.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Then the woman whose son <i>was</i> living spoke to the king, for she yearned with compassion for her son; and she said, &#8220;O my lord, give her the living child, and by no means kill him!&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Kgs-3-26">But the other said, &#8220;Let him be neither mine nor yours, <i>but</i> divide <i>him.</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>So the king answered and said, &#8220;Give the first woman the living child, and by no means kill him; she <i>is</i> his mother.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had rendered; and they feared the king, for they saw that the wisdom of God <i>was</i> in him to administer justice.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-8818a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 3:1">1 Kings 3:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>an alliance</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8826b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 3:9">1 Kings 3:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>hearing</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8831c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 3:14">1 Kings 3:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>prolong</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8835d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 3:18">1 Kings 3:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>no stranger</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
