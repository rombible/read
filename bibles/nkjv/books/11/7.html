<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>He also built the House of the Forest of Lebanon; its length <i>was</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>one hundred cubits, its width <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits, with four rows of cedar pillars, and cedar beams on the pillars. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And <i>it was</i> paneled with cedar above the beams that <i>were</i> on forty-five pillars, fifteen <i>to</i> a row. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span><i>There were</i> windows <i>with beveled frames in</i> three rows, and window <i>was</i> opposite window <i>in</i> three tiers. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And all the doorways and doorposts <i>had</i> rectangular frames; and window <i>was</i> opposite window <i>in</i> three tiers.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>He also made the Hall of Pillars: its length <i>was</i> fifty cubits, and its width thirty cubits; and in front of them <i>was</i> a portico with pillars, and a canopy <i>was</i> in front of them.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then he made a hall for the throne, the Hall of Judgment, where he might judge; and <i>it was</i> paneled with cedar from floor to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>ceiling.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And the house where he dwelt <i>had</i> another court inside the hall, of like workmanship. Solomon also made a house like this hall for Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter, whom he had taken <i>as wife.</i></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>All these <i>were of</i> costly stones cut to size, trimmed with saws, inside and out, from the foundation to the eaves, and also on the outside to the great court. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>The foundation <i>was of</i> costly stones, large stones, some ten cubits and some eight cubits. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And above <i>were</i> costly stones, hewn to size, and cedar wood. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>The great court <i>was</i> enclosed with three rows of hewn stones and a row of cedar beams. So were the inner court of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and the vestibule of the temple.</span></p> <h3>
Hiram the Craftsman</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Kgs-7-13"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Now King Solomon sent and brought <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>Huram from Tyre. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>He <i>was</i> the son of a widow from the tribe of Naphtali, and his father <i>was</i> a man of Tyre, a bronze worker; he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill in working with all kinds of bronze work. So he came to King Solomon and did all his work.</span></p> <h3>
The Bronze Pillars for the Temple</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Kgs-7-15"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And he <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>cast two pillars of bronze, each one eighteen cubits high, and a line of twelve cubits measured the circumference of each. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then he made two capitals <i>of</i> cast bronze, to set on the tops of the pillars. The height of one capital <i>was</i> five cubits, and the height of the other capital <i>was</i> five cubits. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span><i>He made</i> a lattice network, with wreaths of chainwork, for the capitals which <i>were</i> on top of the pillars: seven chains for one capital and seven for the other capital. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>So he made the pillars, and two rows of pomegranates above the network all around to cover the capitals that <i>were</i> on top; and thus he did for the other capital.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>The capitals which <i>were</i> on top of the pillars in the hall <i>were</i> in the shape of lilies, four cubits. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>The capitals on the two pillars also <i>had pomegranates</i> above, by the convex surface which <i>was</i> next to the network; and there <i>were</i> two hundred such pomegranates in rows on each of the capitals all around.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then he set up the pillars by the vestibule of the temple; he set up the pillar on the right and called its name <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>Jachin, and he set up the pillar on the left and called its name <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>Boaz. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>The tops of the pillars were in the shape of lilies. So the work of the pillars was finished.</span></p> <h3>
The Sea and the Oxen</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Kgs-7-23"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And he made the Sea of cast bronze, ten cubits from one brim to the other; <i>it was</i> completely round. Its height <i>was</i> five cubits, and a line of thirty cubits measured its circumference.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Below its brim <i>were</i> ornamental buds encircling it all around, ten to a cubit, all the way around the Sea. The ornamental buds <i>were</i> cast in two rows when it was cast. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>It stood on twelve oxen: three looking toward the north, three looking toward the west, three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; the Sea <i>was set</i> upon them, and all their back parts <i>pointed</i> inward. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>It <i>was</i> a handbreadth thick; and its brim was shaped like the brim of a cup, <i>like</i> a lily blossom. It contained <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>two thousand baths.</span></p> <h3>
The Carts and the Lavers</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Kgs-7-27"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>He also made ten <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>carts of bronze; four cubits <i>was</i> the length of each cart, four cubits its width, and three cubits its height. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And this <i>was</i> the design of the carts: They had panels, and the panels <i>were</i> between frames; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>on the panels that <i>were</i> between the frames <i>were</i> lions, oxen, and cherubim. And on the frames <i>was</i> a pedestal on top. Below the lions and oxen <i>were</i> wreaths of plaited work. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Every cart had four bronze wheels and axles of bronze, and its four feet had supports. Under the laver <i>were</i> supports of cast <i>bronze</i> beside each wreath. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Its opening inside the crown at the top <i>was</i> one cubit in diameter; and the opening <i>was</i> round, shaped <i>like</i> a pedestal, one and a half cubits in outside diameter; and also on the opening <i>were</i> engravings, but the panels were square, not round. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Under the panels <i>were</i> the four wheels, and the axles of the wheels <i>were joined</i> to the cart. The height of a wheel <i>was</i> one and a half cubits. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>The workmanship of the wheels <i>was</i> like the workmanship of a chariot wheel; their axle pins, their rims, their spokes, and their hubs <i>were</i> all of cast <i>bronze.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>And <i>there were</i> four supports at the four corners of each cart; its supports <i>were</i> part of the cart itself. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>On the top of the cart, at the height of half a cubit, <i>it was</i> perfectly round. And on the top of the cart, its flanges and its panels <i>were</i> of the same casting. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>On the plates of its flanges and on its panels he engraved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, wherever there was a clear space on each, with wreaths all around. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>Thus he made the ten carts. All of them were of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>the same mold, one measure, <i>and</i> one shape.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>Then he made ten lavers of bronze; each laver contained <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span>forty baths, <i>and</i> each laver <i>was</i> four cubits. On each of the ten carts <i>was</i> a laver. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>And he put five carts on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house. He set the Sea on the right side of the house, toward the southeast.</span></p> <h3>
Furnishings of the Temple</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Kgs-7-40"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>Huram<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[l]</a></span> made the lavers and the shovels and the bowls. So Huram finished doing all the work that he was to do for King Solomon <i>for</i> the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>the two pillars, the <i>two</i> bowl-shaped capitals that <i>were</i> on top of the two pillars; the two networks covering the two bowl-shaped capitals which <i>were</i> on top of the pillars; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>four hundred pomegranates for the two networks (two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowl-shaped capitals that <i>were</i> on top of the pillars); </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>the ten carts, and ten lavers on the carts; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>one Sea, and twelve oxen under the Sea; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>the pots, the shovels, and the bowls.</span></p><p><span class="text 1Kgs-7-45">All these articles which <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[m]</a></span>Huram made for King Solomon <i>for</i> the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>were of</i> burnished bronze. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span>In the plain of Jordan the king had them cast in clay molds, between Succoth and Zaretan. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-47.htm"><b>47</b></a></span>And Solomon did not weigh all the articles, because <i>there were</i> so many; the weight of the bronze was not determined.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-48.htm"><b>48</b></a></span>Thus Solomon had all the furnishings made for the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: the altar of gold, and the table of gold on which <i>was</i> the showbread; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-49.htm"><b>49</b></a></span>the lampstands of pure gold, five on the right <i>side</i> and five on the left in front of the inner sanctuary, with the flowers and the lamps and the wick-trimmers of gold; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-50.htm"><b>50</b></a></span>the basins, the trimmers, the bowls, the ladles, and the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[n]</a></span>censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, <i>both</i> for the doors of the inner room (the Most Holy <i>Place</i>) <i>and</i> for the doors of the main hall of the temple.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-51.htm"><b>51</b></a></span>So all the work that King Solomon had done for the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was finished; and Solomon brought in the things which his father David had dedicated: the silver and the gold and the furnishings. He put them in the treasuries of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-8937a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 7:2">1 Kings 7:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'>About 150 feet</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8937b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 7:2">1 Kings 7:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'>About 75 feet</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8942c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 7:7">1 Kings 7:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>floor</i> of the upper level</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8948d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 7:13">1 Kings 7:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. <i>Hiram;</i> cf. <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Chr.2.13" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Chr.2.13&amp;version=NKJV">2 Chr. 2:13</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Chr.2.14" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Chr.2.14&amp;version=NKJV">14</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8950e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 7:15">1 Kings 7:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>fashioned</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8956f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 7:21">1 Kings 7:21</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>He Shall Establish</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8956g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 7:21">1 Kings 7:21</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>In It Is Strength</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8961h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 7:26">1 Kings 7:26</span> <span class='footnote-text'>About 12,000 gallons; <i>three thousand,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Chr.4.5" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Chr.4.5&amp;version=NKJV">2 Chr. 4:5</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8962i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 7:27">1 Kings 7:27</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>stands</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8972j"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 7:37">1 Kings 7:37</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>one</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8973k"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 7:38">1 Kings 7:38</span> <span class='footnote-text'>About 240 gallons</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8975l"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 7:40">1 Kings 7:40</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. <i>Hiram;</i> cf. <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Chr.2.13" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Chr.2.13&amp;version=NKJV">2 Chr. 2:13</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Chr.2.14" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Chr.2.14&amp;version=NKJV">14</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8980m"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 7:45">1 Kings 7:45</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. <i>Hiram;</i> cf. <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Chr.2.13" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Chr.2.13&amp;version=NKJV">2 Chr. 2:13</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Chr.2.14" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Chr.2.14&amp;version=NKJV">14</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8985n"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 7:50">1 Kings 7:50</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>firepans</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
