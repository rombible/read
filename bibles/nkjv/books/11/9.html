<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> appeared to Solomon the second time, as He had appeared to him at Gibeon. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to him: &#8220;I have heard your prayer and your supplication that you have made before Me; I have consecrated this house which you have built to put My name there forever, and My eyes and My heart will be there perpetually. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Now if you walk before Me as your father David walked, in integrity of heart and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded you, <i>and</i> if you keep My statutes and My judgments, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever, as I promised David your father, saying, &#8216;You shall not fail to have a man on the throne of Israel.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span><i>But</i> if you or your sons at all <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>turn from following Me, and do not keep My commandments <i>and</i> My statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods and worship them, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>then I will <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>cut off Israel from the land which I have given them; and this house which I have consecrated for My name I will cast out of My sight. Israel will be a proverb and a byword among all peoples. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And <i>as for</i> this house, <i>which</i> is exalted, everyone who passes by it will be astonished and will hiss, and say, &#8216;Why has the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> done thus to this land and to this house?&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then they will answer, &#8216;Because they forsook the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> their God, who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have embraced other gods, and worshiped them and served them; therefore the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has brought all this calamity on them.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Solomon and Hiram Exchange Gifts</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Kgs-9-10"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Now it happened at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and the king&#8217;s house </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>(Hiram the king of Tyre had supplied Solomon with cedar and cypress and gold, as much as he desired), <i>that</i> King Solomon then gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then Hiram went from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him, but they did not please him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So he said, &#8220;What <i>kind of</i> cities <i>are</i> these which you have given me, my brother?&#8221; And he called them the land of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Cabul, as they are to this day. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then Hiram sent the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold.</span></p> <h3>
Solomon&#8217;s Additional Achievements</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Kgs-9-15"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And this <i>is</i> the reason for the labor force which King Solomon raised: to build the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, his own house, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>the Millo, the wall of Jerusalem, Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>(Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up and taken Gezer and burned it with fire, had killed the Canaanites who dwelt in the city, and had given it <i>as</i> a dowry to his daughter, Solomon&#8217;s wife.) </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And Solomon built Gezer, Lower Beth Horon, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land <i>of Judah,</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>all the storage cities that Solomon had, cities for his chariots and cities for his cavalry, and whatever Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>All the people <i>who were</i> left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, who <i>were</i> not of the children of Israel&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>that is, their descendants who were left in the land after them, whom the children of Israel had not been able to destroy completely&#8212;from these Solomon raised forced labor, as it is to this day. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But of the children of Israel Solomon made no forced laborers, because they <i>were</i> men of war and his servants: his officers, his captains, commanders of his chariots, and his cavalry.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Others <i>were</i> chiefs of the officials who <i>were</i> over Solomon&#8217;s work: five hundred and fifty, who ruled over the people who did the work.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>But Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter came up from the City of David to her house which <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span><i>Solomon</i> had built for her. Then he built the Millo.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Now three times a year Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar which he had built for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and he burned incense with them <i>on the altar</i> that <i>was</i> before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. So he finished the temple.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>King Solomon also built a fleet of ships at Ezion Geber, which <i>is</i> near <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>Elath on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Then Hiram sent his servants with the fleet, seamen who knew the sea, to work with the servants of Solomon. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And they went to Ophir, and acquired four hundred and twenty talents of gold from there, and brought <i>it</i> to King Solomon.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-9058a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 9:6">1 Kings 9:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>turn back</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9059b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 9:7">1 Kings 9:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>destroy</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9065c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 9:13">1 Kings 9:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Good for Nothing</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9067d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 9:15">1 Kings 9:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>The Landfill</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9076e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 9:24">1 Kings 9:24</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>he;</i> cf. <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Chr.8.11" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Chr.8.11&amp;version=NKJV">2 Chr. 8:11</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9078f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 9:26">1 Kings 9:26</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. <i>Eloth</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
