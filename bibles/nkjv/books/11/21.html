<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, &#8220;Give me your vineyard, that I may have it for a vegetable garden, because it <i>is</i> near, next to my house; and for it I will give you a vineyard better than it. <i>Or,</i> if it seems good to you, I will give you its worth in money.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But Naboth said to Ahab, &#8220;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> forbid that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to you!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So Ahab went into his house sullen and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him; for he had said, &#8220;I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers.&#8221; And he lay down on his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no food. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said to him, &#8220;Why is your spirit so sullen that you eat no food?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>He said to her, &#8220;Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite, and said to him, &#8216;Give me your vineyard for money; or else, if it pleases you, I will give you <i>another</i> vineyard for it.&#8217; And he answered, &#8216;I will not give you my vineyard.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then Jezebel his wife said to him, &#8220;You now exercise authority over Israel! Arise, eat food, and let your heart be cheerful; I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And she wrote letters in Ahab&#8217;s name, sealed <i>them</i> with his seal, and sent the letters to the elders and the nobles who <i>were</i> dwelling in the city with Naboth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>She wrote in the letters, saying,</span></p><div class="left-1 top-1"><p class="first-line-none"><span class="text 1Kgs-21-9">Proclaim a fast, and seat Naboth <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>with high honor among the people; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and seat two men, scoundrels, before him to bear witness against him, saying, &#8220;You have blasphemed God and the king.&#8221; <i>Then</i> take him out, and stone him, that he may die.</span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So the men of his city, the elders and nobles who were inhabitants of his city, did as Jezebel had sent to them, as it <i>was</i> written in the letters which she had sent to them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>They proclaimed a fast, and seated Naboth with high honor among the people. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And two men, scoundrels, came in and sat before him; and the scoundrels witnessed against him, against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, &#8220;Naboth has blasphemed God and the king!&#8221; Then they took him outside the city and stoned him with stones, so that he died. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, &#8220;Naboth has been stoned and is dead.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, &#8220;Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So it was, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab got up and went down to take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.</span></p> <h3>
The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> Condemns Ahab</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Kgs-21-17"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>&#8220;Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who <i>lives</i> in Samaria. There <i>he is,</i> in the vineyard of Naboth, where he has gone down to take possession of it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>You shall speak to him, saying, &#8216;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8220;Have you murdered and also taken possession?&#8221; &#8217; And you shall speak to him, saying, &#8216;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8220;In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth, dogs shall lick your blood, even yours.&#8221; &#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So Ahab said to Elijah, &#8220;Have you found me, O my enemy?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Kgs-21-20">And he answered, &#8220;I have found <i>you,</i> because you have sold yourself to do evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>&#8216;Behold, I will bring calamity on you. I will take away your posterity, and will cut off from Ahab every male in Israel, both bond and free. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, because of the provocation with which you have provoked <i>Me</i> to anger, and made Israel sin.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And concerning Jezebel the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> also spoke, saying, &#8216;The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>wall of Jezreel.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>The dogs shall eat whoever belongs to Ahab and dies in the city, and the birds of the air shall eat whoever dies in the field.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>But there was no one like Ahab who sold himself to do wickedness in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, because Jezebel his wife <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>stirred him up. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And he behaved very abominably in following idols, according to all <i>that</i> the Amorites had done, whom the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had cast out before the children of Israel.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>So it was, when Ahab heard those words, that he tore his clothes and put sackcloth on his body, and fasted and lay in sackcloth, and went about mourning.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>&#8220;See how Ahab has humbled himself before Me?
