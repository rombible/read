<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Therefore all the men of Israel assembled with King Solomon at the feast in the month of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>Ethanim, which <i>is</i> the seventh month. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then they brought up the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>tabernacle of meeting, and all the holy furnishings that <i>were</i> in the tabernacle.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Also King Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel who were assembled with him, <i>were</i> with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen that could not be counted or numbered for multitude. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> to its place, into the inner sanctuary of the temple, to the Most Holy <i>Place,</i> under the wings of the cherubim. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For the cherubim spread <i>their</i> two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim overshadowed the ark and its poles. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>The poles extended so that the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>ends of the poles could be seen from the holy <i>place,</i> in front of the inner sanctuary; but they could not be seen from outside.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Nothing <i>was</i> in the ark except the two tablets of stone which Moses put there at Horeb, when the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> made <i>a covenant</i> with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.</span></p> <p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>so that the priests could not continue ministering because of the cloud; for the glory of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> filled the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then Solomon spoke:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text 1Kgs-8-12">&#8220;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said He would dwell in the dark cloud.</span><br />

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>&#8216;Since the day that I brought My people Israel out of Egypt, I have chosen no city from any tribe of Israel <i>in which</i> to build a house, that My name might be there; but I chose David to be over My people Israel.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Now it was in the heart of my father David to build a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>temple for the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel. </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And now I pray, O God of Israel, let Your word come true, which You have spoken to Your servant David my father.</span></p> <p>
