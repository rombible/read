<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Therefore his servants said to him, &#8220;Let a young woman, a virgin, be sought for our lord the king, and let her <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>stand before the king, and let her care for him; and let her lie in your bosom, that our lord the king may be warm.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So they sought for a lovely young woman throughout all the territory of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>The young woman <i>was</i> very lovely; and she cared for the king, and served him; but the king did not know her.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then Adonijah the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, &#8220;I will <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>be king&#8221;; and he prepared for himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>(And his father had not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>rebuked him at any time by saying, &#8220;Why have you done so?&#8221; He <i>was</i> also very good-looking. <i>His mother</i> had borne him after Absalom.) </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest, and they followed and helped Adonijah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and the mighty men who <i>belonged</i> to David were not with Adonijah.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And Adonijah sacrificed sheep and oxen and fattened cattle by the stone of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>Zoheleth, which <i>is</i> by En Rogel;<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span> he also invited all his brothers, the king&#8217;s sons, and all the men of Judah, the king&#8217;s servants. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>But he did not invite Nathan the prophet, Benaiah, the mighty men, or Solomon his brother.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, &#8220;Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith has become king, and David our lord does not know <i>it?</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Come, please, let me now give you advice, that you may save your own life and the life of your son Solomon. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Go immediately to King David and say to him, &#8216;Did you not, my lord, O king, swear to your maidservant, saying, &#8220;Assuredly your son Solomon shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne&#8221;? Why then has Adonijah become king?&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then, while you are still talking there with the king, I also will come in after you and confirm your words.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So Bathsheba went into the chamber to the king. (Now the king was very old, and Abishag the Shunammite was serving the king.) </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And Bathsheba bowed and did homage to the king. Then the king said, &#8220;What is your wish?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then she said to him, &#8220;My lord, you swore by the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God to your maidservant, <i>saying,</i> &#8216;Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>So now, look! Adonijah has become king; and now, my lord the king, you do not know about <i>it.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>He has sacrificed oxen and fattened cattle and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the sons of the king, Abiathar the priest, and Joab the commander of the army; but Solomon your servant he has not invited. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And as for you, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel <i>are</i> on you, that you should tell them who will sit on the throne of my lord the king after him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Otherwise it will happen, when my lord the king rests with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon will be counted as offenders.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And just then, while she was still talking with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>So they told the king, saying, &#8220;Here is Nathan the prophet.&#8221; And when he came in before the king, he bowed down before the king with his face to the ground. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And Nathan said, &#8220;My lord, O king, have you said, &#8216;Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne&#8217;? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>For he has gone down today, and has sacrificed oxen and fattened cattle and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the king&#8217;s sons, and the commanders of the army, and Abiathar the priest; and look! They are eating and drinking before him; and they say, &#8216;<i>Long</i><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span> live King Adonijah!&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>But he has not invited me&#8212;me your servant&#8212;nor Zadok the priest, nor Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, nor your servant Solomon. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Has this thing been done by my lord the king, and you have not told your servant who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
David Proclaims Solomon King</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Kgs-1-28"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then King David answered and said, &#8220;Call Bathsheba to me.&#8221; So she came into the king&#8217;s presence and stood before the king. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And the king took an oath and said, &#8220;<i>As</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> lives, who has redeemed my life from every distress, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>just as I swore to you by the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel, saying, &#8216;Assuredly Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my place,&#8217; so I certainly will do this day.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Then Bathsheba bowed with <i>her</i> face to the earth, and paid homage to the king, and said, &#8220;Let my lord King David live forever!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And King David said, &#8220;Call to me Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada.&#8221; So they came before the king. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>The king also said to them, &#8220;Take with you the servants of your lord, and have Solomon my son ride on my own mule, and take him down to Gihon.<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>There let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him king over Israel; and blow the horn, and say, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>&#8216;<i>Long</i> live King Solomon!&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Then you shall come up after him, and he shall come and sit on my throne, and he shall be king in my place. For I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and Judah.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king and said, &#8220;Amen! May the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of my lord the king say so <i>too.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>As the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has been with my lord the king, even so may He be with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites went down and had Solomon ride on King David&#8217;s mule, and took him to Gihon. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>Then Zadok the priest took a horn of oil from the tabernacle and anointed Solomon. And they blew the horn, and all the people said, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span>&#8220;<i>Long</i> live King Solomon!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>And all the people went up after him; and the people played the flutes and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth <i>seemed to</i> split with their sound.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>Now Adonijah and all the guests who <i>were</i> with him heard <i>it</i> as they finished eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the horn, he said, &#8220;Why <i>is</i> the city in such a noisy uproar?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>While he was still speaking, there came Jonathan, the son of Abiathar the priest. And Adonijah said to him, &#8220;Come in, for you <i>are</i> a prominent man, and bring good news.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>Then Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, &#8220;No! Our lord King David has made Solomon king. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>The king has sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites; and they have made him ride on the king&#8217;s mule. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>So Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon; and they have gone up from there rejoicing, so that the city is in an uproar. This <i>is</i> the noise that you have heard. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span>Also Solomon sits on the throne of the kingdom. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-47.htm"><b>47</b></a></span>And moreover the king&#8217;s servants have gone to bless our lord King David, saying, &#8216;May God make the name of Solomon better than your name, and may He make his throne greater than your throne.&#8217; Then the king bowed himself on the bed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-48.htm"><b>48</b></a></span>Also the king said thus, &#8216;Blessed <i>be</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel, who has given <i>one</i> to sit on my throne this day, while my eyes see <i>it!</i>&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-49.htm"><b>49</b></a></span>So all the guests who were with Adonijah were afraid, and arose, and each one went his way.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-50.htm"><b>50</b></a></span>Now Adonijah was afraid of Solomon; so he arose, and went and took hold of the horns of the altar. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-51.htm"><b>51</b></a></span>And it was told Solomon, saying, &#8220;Indeed Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon; for look, he has taken hold of the horns of the altar, saying, &#8216;Let King Solomon swear to me today that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-52.htm"><b>52</b></a></span>Then Solomon said, &#8220;If he proves himself a worthy man, not one hair of him shall fall to the earth; but if wickedness is found in him, he shall die.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-53.htm"><b>53</b></a></span>So King Solomon sent them to bring him down from the altar.
