<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Jeroboam said to his wife, &#8220;Please arise, and disguise yourself, that they may not recognize you as the wife of Jeroboam, and go to Shiloh. Indeed, Ahijah the prophet <i>is</i> there, who told me that <i>I would be</i> king over this people. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Also take <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>with you ten loaves, <i>some</i> cakes, and a jar of honey, and go to him; he will tell you what will become of the child.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And Jeroboam&#8217;s wife did so; she arose and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see, for his eyes were <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>glazed by reason of his age.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had said to Ahijah, &#8220;Here is the wife of Jeroboam, coming to ask you something about her son, for he <i>is</i> sick. Thus and thus you shall say to her; for it will be, when she comes in, that she will pretend <i>to be</i> another <i>woman.</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And so it was, when Ahijah heard the sound of her footsteps as she came through the door, he said, &#8220;Come in, wife of Jeroboam. Why do you pretend <i>to be</i> another <i>person?</i> For I <i>have been</i> sent to you <i>with</i> bad <i>news.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Go, tell Jeroboam, &#8216;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel: &#8220;Because I exalted you from among the people, and made you ruler over My people Israel, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>and tore the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it to you; and <i>yet</i> you have not been as My servant David, who kept My commandments and who followed Me with all his heart, to do only <i>what was</i> right in My eyes; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>but you have done more evil than all who were before you, for you have gone and made for yourself other gods and molded images to provoke Me to anger, and have cast Me behind your back&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>therefore behold! I will bring disaster on the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam every male in Israel, bond and free; I will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as one takes away refuse until it is all gone. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>The dogs shall eat whoever belongs to Jeroboam and dies in the city, and the birds of the air shall eat whoever dies in the field; for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has spoken!&#8221; &#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Arise therefore, go to your own house. When your feet enter the city, the child shall die. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And all Israel shall mourn for him and bury him, for he is the only one of Jeroboam who shall <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>come to the grave, because in him there is found something good toward the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>&#8220;Moreover the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will raise up for Himself a king over Israel who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam; <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>this is the day. What? Even now! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>For the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will strike Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water. He will uproot Israel from this good land which He gave to their fathers, and will scatter them beyond <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>the River, because they have made their <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>wooden images, provoking the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> to anger. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And He will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, who sinned and who made Israel sin.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then Jeroboam&#8217;s wife arose and departed, and came to Tirzah. When she came to the threshold of the house, the child died. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> which He spoke through His servant Ahijah the prophet.</span></p> <h3>
Death of Jeroboam</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Kgs-14-19"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he made war and how he reigned, indeed they <i>are</i> written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>The period that Jeroboam reigned <i>was</i> twenty-two years. So he rested with his fathers. Then Nadab his son reigned in his place.</span></p> <h3>
Rehoboam Reigns in Judah</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Kgs-14-21"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam <i>was</i> forty-one years old when he became king. He reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put His name there. His mother&#8217;s name <i>was</i> Naamah, an Ammonitess. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Now Judah did evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and they provoked Him to jealousy with their sins which they committed, more than all that their fathers had done. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>For they also built for themselves high<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span> places, <i>sacred</i> pillars, and wooden images on every high hill and under every green tree. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And there were also <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>perverted persons in the land. They did according to all the abominations of the nations which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had cast out before the children of Israel.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>It happened in the fifth year of King Rehoboam <i>that</i> Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And he took away the treasures of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and the treasures of the king&#8217;s house; he took away everything. He also took away all the gold shields which Solomon had made. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Then King Rehoboam made bronze shields in their place, and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>committed <i>them</i> to the hands of the captains of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>guard, who guarded the doorway of the king&#8217;s house. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And whenever the king entered the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, the guards carried them, then brought them back into the guardroom.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all <i>their</i> days. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>So Rehoboam <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span>rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of David. His mother&#8217;s name <i>was</i> Naamah, an Ammonitess. Then Abijam<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[l]</a></span> his son reigned in his place.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-9222a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 14:3">1 Kings 14:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>in your hand</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9223b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 14:4">1 Kings 14:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>set</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9232c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 14:13">1 Kings 14:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Be buried</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9233d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 14:14">1 Kings 14:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>this day and from now on</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9234e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 14:15">1 Kings 14:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'>The Euphrates</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9234f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 14:15">1 Kings 14:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. <i>Asherim,</i> Canaanite deities</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9242g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 14:23">1 Kings 14:23</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Places for pagan worship</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9243h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 14:24">1 Kings 14:24</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. <i>qadesh,</i> one practicing sodomy and prostitution in religious rituals</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9246i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 14:27">1 Kings 14:27</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>entrusted</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9246j"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 14:27">1 Kings 14:27</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>runners</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9250k"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 14:31">1 Kings 14:31</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Died and joined his ancestors</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9250l"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 14:31">1 Kings 14:31</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Abijah,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Chr.12.16" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Chr.12.16&amp;version=NKJV">2 Chr. 12:16ff</span></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
