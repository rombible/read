<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then it came to pass, in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went down to <i>visit</i> the king of Israel.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And the king of Israel said to his servants, &#8220;Do you know that Ramoth in Gilead <i>is</i> ours, but we hesitate to take it out of the hand of the king of Syria?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So he said to Jehoshaphat, &#8220;Will you go with me to fight at Ramoth Gilead?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Kgs-22-4">Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, &#8220;I <i>am</i> as you <i>are,</i> my people as your people, my horses as your horses.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Also Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, &#8220;Please inquire for the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> today.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then the king of Israel gathered <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, &#8220;Shall I go against Ramoth Gilead to fight, or shall I refrain?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Kgs-22-6">So they said, &#8220;Go up, for the Lord will deliver <i>it</i> into the hand of the king.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And Jehoshaphat said, &#8220;<i>Is there</i> not still a prophet of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> here, that we may inquire of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>Him?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, &#8220;<i>There is</i> still one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may inquire of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; but I hate him, because he does not prophesy good concerning me, but evil.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Kgs-22-8">And Jehoshaphat said, &#8220;Let not the king say such things!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then the king of Israel called an officer and said, &#8220;Bring Micaiah the son of Imlah quickly!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>The king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, having put on <i>their</i> robes, sat each on his throne, at a threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made horns of iron for himself; and he said, &#8220;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8216;With these you shall gore the Syrians until they are destroyed.&#8217; &#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, &#8220;Go up to Ramoth Gilead and prosper, for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will deliver <i>it</i> into the king&#8217;s hand.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then the messenger who had gone to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, &#8220;Now listen, the words of the prophets with one accord encourage the king. Please, let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak encouragement.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And Micaiah said, &#8220;<i>As</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> lives, whatever the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> says to me, that I will speak.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then he came to the king; and the king said to him, &#8220;Micaiah, shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall we refrain?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Kgs-22-15">And he answered him, &#8220;Go and prosper, for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will deliver <i>it</i> into the hand of the king!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So the king said to him, &#8220;How many times shall I make you swear that you tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then he said, &#8220;I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said, &#8216;These have no master. Let each return to his house in peace.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, &#8220;Did I not tell you he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then <i>Micaiah</i> said, &#8220;Therefore hear the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: I saw the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing by, on His right hand and on His left. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said, &#8216;Who will persuade Ahab to go up, that he may fall at Ramoth Gilead?&#8217; So one spoke in this manner, and another spoke in that manner. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then a spirit came forward and stood before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and said, &#8216;I will persuade him.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to him, &#8216;In what way?&#8217; So he said, &#8216;I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.&#8217; And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said, &#8216;You shall persuade <i>him,</i> and also prevail. Go out and do so.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Therefore look! The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these prophets of yours, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has declared disaster against you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Now Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said, &#8220;Which way did the spirit from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> go from me to speak to you?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And Micaiah said, &#8220;Indeed, you shall see on that day when you go into an inner chamber to hide!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>So the king of Israel said, &#8220;Take Micaiah, and return him to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king&#8217;s son; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>and say, &#8216;Thus says the king: &#8220;Put this <i>fellow</i> in prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and water of affliction, until I come in peace.&#8221; &#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>But Micaiah said, &#8220;If you ever return in peace, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has not spoken by me.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Take heed, all you people!&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Ahab Dies in Battle</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Kgs-22-29"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, &#8220;I will disguise myself and go into battle; but you put on your robes.&#8221; So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Now the king of Syria had commanded the thirty-two captains of his chariots, saying, &#8220;Fight with no one small or great, but only with the king of Israel.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>So it was, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, &#8220;Surely it <i>is</i> the king of Israel!&#8221; Therefore they turned aside to fight against him, and Jehoshaphat cried out. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And it happened, when the captains of the chariots saw that it <i>was</i> not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Now a <i>certain</i> man drew a bow at random, and struck the king of Israel between the joints of his armor. So he said to the driver of his chariot, &#8220;Turn around and take me out of the battle, for I am wounded.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>The battle increased that day; and the king was propped up in his chariot, facing the Syrians, and died at evening. The blood ran out from the wound onto the floor of the chariot. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Then, as the sun was going down, a shout went throughout the army, saying, &#8220;Every man to his city, and every man to his own country!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>So the king died, and was brought to Samaria. And they buried the king in Samaria. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>Then <i>someone</i> washed the chariot at a pool in Samaria, and the dogs licked up his blood while <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>the harlots bathed, according to the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> which He had spoken.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, the ivory house which he built and all the cities that he built, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>So Ahab <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>rested with his fathers. Then Ahaziah his son reigned in his place.</span></p> <h3>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>And he walked in all the ways of his father Asa.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>Also Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, the might that he showed, and how he made war, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-49.htm"><b>49</b></a></span>Then Ahaziah the son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, &#8220;Let my servants go with your servants in the ships.&#8221; But Jehoshaphat would not.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-50.htm"><b>50</b></a></span>And Jehoshaphat <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of David his father.
