<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother&#8217;s name <i>was</i> Maachah the granddaughter of Abishalom. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him; his heart was not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>loyal to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> his God, as was the heart of his father David. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Nevertheless for David&#8217;s sake the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, by setting up his son after him and by establishing Jerusalem; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>because David did <i>what was</i> right in the eyes of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and had not turned aside from anything that He commanded him all the days of his life, except in the matter of Uriah the Hittite. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And there was war between <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So Abijam <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>rested with his fathers, and they buried him in the City of David. Then Asa his son reigned in his place.</span></p> <h3>
Asa Reigns in Judah</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Kgs-15-9"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>In the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Asa became king over Judah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And he reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem. His grandmother&#8217;s name <i>was</i> Maachah the granddaughter of Abishalom. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Asa did <i>what was</i> right in the eyes of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, as <i>did</i> his father David. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And he banished the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>perverted persons from the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Also he removed Maachah his grandmother from <i>being</i> queen mother, because she had made an obscene image of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>Asherah. And Asa cut down her obscene image and burned <i>it</i> by the Brook Kidron. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>high places were not removed. Nevertheless Asa&#8217;s heart was loyal to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> all his days. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>He also brought into the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> the things which his father had dedicated, and the things which he himself had dedicated: silver and gold and utensils.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Now there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then Asa took all the silver and gold <i>that was</i> left in the treasuries of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and the treasuries of the king&#8217;s house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants. And King Asa sent them to Ben-Hadad the son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, who dwelt in Damascus, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>&#8220;<i>Let there be</i> a treaty between you and me, as there was between my father and your father. See, I have sent you a present of silver and gold. Come and break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel, so that he will withdraw from me.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So Ben-Hadad heeded King Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel. He attacked Ijon, Dan, Abel Beth Maachah, and all Chinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Now it happened, when Baasha heard <i>it,</i> that he stopped building Ramah, and remained in Tirzah.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then King Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none <i>was</i> exempted. And they took away the stones and timber of Ramah, which Baasha had used for building; and with them King Asa built Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>The rest of all the acts of Asa, all his might, all that he did, and the cities which he built, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? But in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>So Asa <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of David his father. Then Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place.</span></p> <h3>
Nadab Reigns in Israel</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Kgs-15-25"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Now Nadab the son of Jeroboam became king over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and he reigned over Israel two years. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And he did evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin by which he had made Israel sin.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Then Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him. And Baasha killed him at Gibbethon, which <i>belonged</i> to the Philistines, while Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Baasha killed him in the third year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his place. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And it was so, when he became king, <i>that</i> he killed all the house of Jeroboam. He did not leave to Jeroboam anyone that breathed, until he had destroyed him, according to the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> which He had spoken by His servant Ahijah the Shilonite, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>because of the sins of Jeroboam, which he had sinned and by which he had made Israel sin, because of his provocation with which he had provoked the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel to anger.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? </span>
