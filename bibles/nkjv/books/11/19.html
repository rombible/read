<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, &#8220;So let the gods do <i>to me,</i> and more also, if I do not make your life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And when he saw <i>that,</i> he arose and ran for his life, and went to Beersheba, which <i>belongs</i> to Judah, and left his servant there.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But he himself went a day&#8217;s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>broom tree. And he prayed that he might die, and said, &#8220;It is enough! Now, <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, take my life, for I <i>am</i> no better than my fathers!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then as he lay and slept under a broom tree, suddenly an <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>angel touched him, and said to him, &#8220;Arise <i>and</i> eat.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then he looked, and there by his head <i>was</i> a cake baked on <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>coals, and a jar of water. So he ate and drank, and lay down again. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came back the second time, and touched him, and said, &#8220;Arise <i>and</i> eat, because the journey <i>is</i> too great for you.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So he arose, and ate and drank; and he went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights as far as Horeb, the mountain of God.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And there he went into a cave, and spent the night in that place; and behold, the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>came</i> to him, and He said to him, &#8220;What are you doing here, Elijah?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So he said, &#8220;I have been very zealous for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of hosts; for the children of Israel have forsaken Your covenant, torn down Your altars, and killed Your prophets with the sword. I alone am left; and they seek to take my life.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
God&#8217;s Revelation to Elijah</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Kgs-19-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then He said, &#8220;Go out, and stand on the mountain before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221; And behold, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> passed by, and a great and strong wind tore into the mountains and broke the rocks in pieces before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, <i>but</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>was</i> not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake, <i>but</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>was</i> not in the earthquake; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>and after the earthquake a fire, <i>but</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>was</i> not in the fire; and after the fire <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>a still small voice.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So it was, when Elijah heard <i>it,</i> that he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entrance of the cave. Suddenly a voice <i>came</i> to him, and said, &#8220;What are you doing here, Elijah?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;I have been very zealous for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of hosts; because the children of Israel have forsaken Your covenant, torn down Your altars, and killed Your prophets with the sword. I alone am left; and they seek to take my life.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to him: &#8220;Go, return on your way to the Wilderness of Damascus; and when you arrive, anoint Hazael <i>as</i> king over Syria. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Also you shall anoint Jehu the son of Nimshi <i>as</i> king over Israel. And Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel Meholah you shall anoint <i>as</i> prophet in your place. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>It shall be <i>that</i> whoever escapes the sword of Hazael, Jehu will kill; and whoever escapes the sword of Jehu, Elisha will kill. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Yet I have reserved seven thousand in Israel, all whose knees have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth that has not kissed him.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Elisha Follows Elijah</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Kgs-19-19"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>So he departed from there, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who <i>was</i> plowing <i>with</i> twelve yoke <i>of oxen</i> before him, and he was with the twelfth. Then Elijah passed by him and threw his mantle on him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And he left the oxen and ran after Elijah, and said, &#8220;Please let me kiss my father and my mother, and <i>then</i> I will follow you.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Kgs-19-20">And he said to him, &#8220;Go back again, for what have I done to you?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>So <i>Elisha</i> turned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen and slaughtered them and boiled their flesh, using the oxen&#8217;s equipment, and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he arose and followed Elijah, and became his servant.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-9392a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 19:4">1 Kings 19:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>juniper</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9393b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 19:5">1 Kings 19:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>Angel</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9394c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 19:6">1 Kings 19:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>hot stones</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9395d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 19:7">1 Kings 19:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>Angel</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9400e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 19:12">1 Kings 19:12</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>a delicate whispering voice</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
