<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then he cried out against the altar <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>by the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and said, &#8220;O altar, altar! Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8216;Behold, a child, Josiah by name, shall be born to the house of David; and on you he shall sacrifice the priests of the high places who burn incense on you, and men&#8217;s bones shall be burned on you.&#8217; &#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And he gave a sign the same day, saying, &#8220;This <i>is</i> the sign which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has spoken: Surely the altar shall split apart, and the ashes on it shall be poured out.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So it came to pass when King Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God, who cried out against the altar in Bethel, that he stretched out his hand from the altar, saying, &#8220;Arrest him!&#8221; Then his hand, which he stretched out toward him, withered, so that he could not pull it back to himself. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>The altar also was split apart, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then the king answered and said to the man of God, &#8220;Please entreat the favor of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored to me.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Kgs-13-6">So the man of God entreated the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and the king&#8217;s hand was restored to him, and became as before. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then the king said to the man of God, &#8220;Come home with me and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But the man of God said to the king, &#8220;If you were to give me half your house, I would not go in with you; nor would I eat bread nor drink water in this place. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For so it was commanded me by the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, saying, &#8216;You shall not eat bread, nor drink water, nor return by the same way you came.&#8217; &#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So he went another way and did not return by the way he came to Bethel.</span></p> <h3>
Death of the Man of God</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Kgs-13-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now an old prophet dwelt in Bethel, and his <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel; they also told their father the words which he had spoken to the king. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And their father said to them, &#8220;Which way did he go?&#8221; For his sons <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>had seen which way the man of God went who came from Judah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then he said to his sons, &#8220;Saddle the donkey for me.&#8221; So they saddled the donkey for him; and he rode on it, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>and went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak. Then he said to him, &#8220;<i>Are</i> you the man of God who came from Judah?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Kgs-13-14">And he said, &#8220;I <i>am.</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then he said to him, &#8220;Come home with me and eat bread.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;I cannot return with you nor go in with you; neither can I eat bread nor drink water with you in this place. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>For <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>I have been told by the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, &#8216;You shall not eat bread nor drink water there, nor return by going the way you came.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>He said to him, &#8220;I too <i>am</i> a prophet as you <i>are,</i> and an angel spoke to me by the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, saying, &#8216;Bring him back with you to your house, that he may eat bread and drink water.&#8217; &#8221; (He was lying to him.)</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>So he went back with him, and ate bread in his house, and drank water.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Now it happened, as they sat at the table, that the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came to the prophet who had brought him back; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>and he cried out to the man of God who came from Judah, saying, &#8220;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8216;Because you have disobeyed the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and have not kept the commandment which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God commanded you, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>but you came back, ate bread, and drank water in the place of which <i>the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span></i> said to you, &#8220;Eat no bread and drink no water,&#8221; your corpse shall not come to the tomb of your fathers.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>So it was, after he had eaten bread and after he had drunk, that he saddled the donkey for him, the prophet whom he had brought back. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>When he was gone, a lion met him on the road and killed him. And his corpse was thrown on the road, and the donkey stood by it. The lion also stood by the corpse. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And there, men passed by and saw the corpse thrown on the road, and the lion standing by the corpse. Then they went and told <i>it</i> in the city where the old prophet dwelt.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Now when the prophet who had brought him back from the way heard <i>it,</i> he said, &#8220;It <i>is</i> the man of God who was disobedient to the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. Therefore the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has delivered him to the lion, which has torn him and killed him, according to the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> which He spoke to him.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And he spoke to his sons, saying, &#8220;Saddle the donkey for me.&#8221; So they saddled <i>it.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then he went and found his corpse thrown on the road, and the donkey and the lion standing by the corpse. The lion had not eaten the corpse nor torn the donkey. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And the prophet took up the corpse of the man of God, laid it on the donkey, and brought it back. So the old prophet came to the city to mourn, and to bury him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Then he laid the corpse in his own tomb; and they mourned over him, <i>saying,</i> &#8220;Alas, my brother!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>So it was, after he had buried him, that he spoke to his sons, saying, &#8220;When I am dead, then bury me in the tomb where the man of God <i>is</i> buried; lay my bones beside his bones. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>For the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>saying which he cried out by the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> against the altar in Bethel, and against all the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>shrines on the high places which <i>are</i> in the cities of Samaria, will surely come to pass.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>After this event Jeroboam did not turn from his evil way, but again he made priests from every class of people for the high places; whoever wished, he consecrated him, and he became <i>one</i> of the priests of the high places. </span>
