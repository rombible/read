<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>from the nations of whom the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had said to the children of Israel, &#8220;You shall not intermarry with them, nor they with you. Surely they will turn away your hearts after their gods.&#8221; Solomon clung to these in love. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned away his heart. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For it was so, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned his heart after other gods; and his heart was not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>loyal to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> his God, as <i>was</i> the heart of his father David. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span> the abomination of the Ammonites. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Solomon did evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and did not fully follow the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, as <i>did</i> his father David. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then Solomon built a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, on the hill that <i>is</i> east of Jerusalem, and for Molech the abomination of the people of Ammon. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And he did likewise for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and sacrificed to their gods.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> became angry with Solomon, because his heart had turned from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods; but he did not keep what the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had commanded. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Therefore the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Solomon, &#8220;Because you have done this, and have not kept My covenant and My statutes, which I have commanded you, I will surely tear the kingdom away from you and give it to your servant. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Nevertheless I will not do it in your days, for the sake of your father David; I will tear it out of the hand of your son. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>However I will not tear away the whole kingdom; I will give one tribe to your son for the sake of My servant David, and for the sake of Jerusalem which I have chosen.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Adversaries of Solomon</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Kgs-11-14"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Now the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> raised up an adversary against Solomon, Hadad the Edomite; he <i>was</i> a descendant of the king in Edom. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>For it happened, when David was in Edom, and Joab the commander of the army had gone up to bury the slain, after he had killed every male in Edom </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>(because for six months Joab remained there with all Israel, until he had cut down every male in Edom), </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>that Hadad fled to go to Egypt, he and certain Edomites of his father&#8217;s servants with him. Hadad <i>was</i> still a little child. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then they arose from Midian and came to Paran; and they took men with them from Paran and came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house, apportioned food for him, and gave him land. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him as wife the sister of his own wife, that is, the sister of Queen Tahpenes. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then the sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh&#8217;s house. And Genubath was in Pharaoh&#8217;s household among the sons of Pharaoh.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>So when Hadad heard in Egypt that David <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>rested with his fathers, and that Joab the commander of the army was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>&#8220;Let me depart, that I may go to my own country.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then Pharaoh said to him, &#8220;But what have you lacked with me, that suddenly you seek to go to your own country?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Kgs-11-22">So he answered, &#8220;Nothing, but do let me go anyway.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And God raised up <i>another</i> adversary against him, Rezon the son of Eliadah, who had fled from his lord, Hadadezer king of Zobah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>So he gathered men to him and became captain over a band <i>of raiders,</i> when David killed those <i>of Zobah.</i> And they went to Damascus and dwelt there, and reigned in Damascus. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>He was an adversary of Israel all the days of Solomon (besides the trouble that Hadad <i>caused</i>); and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.</span></p> <h3>
Jeroboam&#8217;s Rebellion</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Kgs-11-26"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Then Solomon&#8217;s servant, Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite from Zereda, whose mother&#8217;s name <i>was</i> Zeruah, a widow, also rebelled against the king.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And this <i>is</i> what caused him to rebel against the king: Solomon had built the Millo <i>and</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>repaired the damages to the City of David his father. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>The man Jeroboam <i>was</i> a mighty man of valor; and Solomon, seeing that the young man was industrious, made him the officer over all the labor force of the house of Joseph.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Now it happened at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite met him on the way; and he had clothed himself with a new garment, and the two <i>were</i> alone in the field. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Then Ahijah took hold of the new garment that <i>was</i> on him, and tore it <i>into</i> twelve pieces. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>And he said to Jeroboam, &#8220;Take for yourself ten pieces, for thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel: &#8216;Behold, I will tear the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon and will give ten tribes to you </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>(but he shall have one tribe for the sake of My servant David, and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel), </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>because <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>they have forsaken Me, and worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the people of Ammon, and have not walked in My ways to do <i>what is</i> right in My eyes and <i>keep</i> My statutes and My judgments, as <i>did</i> his father David. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>However I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand, because I have made him ruler all the days of his life for the sake of My servant David, whom I chose because he kept My commandments and My statutes. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>But I will take the kingdom out of his son&#8217;s hand and give it to you&#8212;ten tribes. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>And to his son I will give one tribe, that My servant David may always have a lamp before Me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen for Myself, to put My name there. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>So I will take you, and you shall reign over all your heart desires, and you shall be king over Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>Then it shall be, if you heed all that I command you, walk in My ways, and do <i>what is</i> right in My sight, to keep My statutes and My commandments, as My servant David did, then I will be with you and build for you an enduring house, as I built for David, and will give Israel to you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>And I will afflict the descendants of David because of this, but not forever.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>Solomon therefore sought to kill Jeroboam. But Jeroboam arose and fled to Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.</span></p> <h3>
Death of Solomon</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Kgs-11-41"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, all that he did, and his wisdom, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon? </span>
