<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>She came to Jerusalem with a very great <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>retinue, with camels that bore spices, very much gold, and precious stones; and when she came to Solomon, she spoke with him about all that was in her heart. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So Solomon answered all her questions; there was nothing <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>so difficult for the king that he could not explain <i>it</i> to her. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And when the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>the food on his table, the seating of his servants, the service of his waiters and their apparel, his cupbearers, and his entryway by which he went up to the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, there was no more spirit in her. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then she said to the king: &#8220;It was a true report which I heard in my own land about your words and your wisdom. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>However I did not believe the words until I came and saw with my own eyes; and indeed the half was not told me. Your wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame of which I heard. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Happy <i>are</i> your men and happy <i>are</i> these your servants, who stand continually before you <i>and</i> hear your wisdom! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Blessed be the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God, who delighted in you, setting you on the throne of Israel! Because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has loved Israel forever, therefore He made you king, to do justice and righteousness.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then she gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold, spices in great quantity, and precious stones. There never again came such abundance of spices as the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Also, the ships of Hiram, which brought gold from Ophir, brought great quantities of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>almug wood and precious stones from Ophir. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And the king made <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>steps of the almug wood for the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and for the king&#8217;s house, also harps and stringed instruments for singers. There never again came such almug wood, nor has the like been seen to this day.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Now King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all she desired, whatever she asked, besides what Solomon had given her according to the royal generosity. So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.</span></p> <h3>
Solomon&#8217;s Great Wealth</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Kgs-10-14"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>The weight of gold that came to Solomon yearly was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>besides <i>that</i> from the traveling merchants, from the income of traders, from all the kings of Arabia, and from the governors of the country.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And King Solomon made two hundred large shields <i>of</i> hammered gold; six hundred <i>shekels</i> of gold went into each shield. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>He also <i>made</i> three hundred shields <i>of</i> hammered gold; three minas of gold went into each shield. The king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne <i>was</i> round at the back; <i>there were</i> armrests on either side of the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the armrests. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Twelve lions stood there, one on each side of the six steps; nothing like <i>this</i> had been made for any <i>other</i> kingdom.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>All King Solomon&#8217;s drinking vessels <i>were</i> gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon <i>were</i> pure gold. Not <i>one was</i> silver, for this was accounted as nothing in the days of Solomon. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>For the king had merchant<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span> ships at sea with the fleet of Hiram. Once every three years the merchant ships came bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>monkeys. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>So King Solomon surpassed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Now all the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Each man brought his present: articles of silver and gold, garments, armor, spices, horses, and mules, at a set rate year by year.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen; he had one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>stationed in the chariot cities and with the king at Jerusalem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>The king made silver <i>as common</i> in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedar trees as abundant as the sycamores which <i>are</i> in the lowland.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Also Solomon had horses imported from Egypt and Keveh; the king&#8217;s merchants bought them in Keveh at the <i>current</i> price. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Now a chariot that was imported from Egypt cost six hundred <i>shekels</i> of silver, and a horse one hundred and fifty; and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>thus, through their agents, they exported <i>them</i> to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-9082a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 10:2">1 Kings 10:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>company</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9083b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 10:3">1 Kings 10:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>too</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9091c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 10:11">1 Kings 10:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>algum,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Chr.9.10" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Chr.9.10&amp;version=NKJV">2 Chr. 9:10</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Chr.9.11" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Chr.9.11&amp;version=NKJV">11</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9092d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 10:12">1 Kings 10:12</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>supports</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9102e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 10:22">1 Kings 10:22</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>ships of Tarshish,</i> deep-sea vessels</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9102f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 10:22">1 Kings 10:22</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>peacocks</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9106g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Kings 10:26">1 Kings 10:26</span> <span class='footnote-text'>So with LXX, Syr., Tg., Vg.
