<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Inasmuch as I lifted you out of the dust and made you ruler over My people Israel, and you have walked in the way of Jeroboam, and have made My people Israel sin, to provoke Me to anger with their sins, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>surely I will take<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span> away the posterity of Baasha and the posterity of his house, and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>The dogs shall eat whoever belongs to Baasha and dies in the city, and the birds of the air shall eat whoever dies in the fields.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, what he did, and his might, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So Baasha <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>rested with his fathers and was buried in Tirzah. Then Elah his son reigned in his place.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And also the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came by the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha and his house, because of all the evil that he did in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> in provoking Him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam, and because he killed them.</span></p> <h3>
Elah Reigns in Israel</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Kgs-16-8"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah the son of Baasha became king over Israel, <i>and reigned</i> two years in Tirzah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Now his servant Zimri, commander of half <i>his</i> chariots, conspired against him as he was in Tirzah drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, steward<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> of <i>his</i> house in Tirzah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And Zimri went in and struck him and killed him in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his place.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he was seated on his throne, <i>that</i> he killed all the household of Baasha; he did not leave him one male, neither of his relatives nor of his friends. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Thus Zimri destroyed all the household of Baasha, according to the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, which He spoke against Baasha by Jehu the prophet, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>for all the sins of Baasha and the sins of Elah his son, by which they had sinned and by which they had made Israel sin, in provoking the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel to anger with their <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>idols.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</span></p> <h3>
Zimri Reigns in Israel</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Kgs-16-15"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, Zimri had reigned in Tirzah seven days. And the people <i>were</i> encamped against Gibbethon, which <i>belonged</i> to the Philistines. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Now the people <i>who were</i> encamped heard it said, &#8220;Zimri has conspired and also has killed the king.&#8221; So all Israel made Omri, the commander of the army, king over Israel that day in the camp. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then Omri and all Israel with him went up from Gibbethon, and they besieged Tirzah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And it happened, when Zimri saw that the city was <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>taken, that he went into the citadel of the king&#8217;s house and burned the king&#8217;s house <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>down upon himself with fire, and died, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>because of the sins which he had committed in doing evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he had committed to make Israel sin.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and the treason he committed, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</span></p> <h3>
Omri Reigns in Israel</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Kgs-16-21"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then the people of Israel were divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king, and half followed Omri. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But the people who followed Omri prevailed over the people who followed Tibni the son of Ginath. So Tibni died and Omri reigned. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah, Omri became king over Israel, <i>and reigned</i> twelve years. Six years he reigned in Tirzah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And he bought the hill of Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver; then he built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, Samaria,<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span> after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Omri did evil in the eyes of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and did worse than all who <i>were</i> before him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>For he walked in all the ways of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sin by which he had made Israel sin, provoking the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel to anger with their idols.<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and the might that he showed, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>So Omri rested with his fathers and was buried in Samaria. Then Ahab his son reigned in his place.</span></p> <h3>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Now Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, more than all who <i>were</i> before him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>And it came to pass, as though it had been a trivial thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took as wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal, king of the Sidonians; and he went and served Baal and worshiped him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Then he set up an altar for Baal in the temple of Baal, which he had built in Samaria. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And Ahab made a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>wooden image.
