<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab; and <i>there was</i> a severe famine in Samaria. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And Ahab had called Obadiah, who <i>was</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>in charge of <i>his</i> house. (Now Obadiah feared the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> greatly. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For so it was, while Jezebel <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>massacred the prophets of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, that Obadiah had taken one hundred prophets and hidden them, fifty to a cave, and had fed them with bread and water.) </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And Ahab had said to Obadiah, &#8220;Go into the land to all the springs of water and to all the brooks; perhaps we may find grass to keep the horses and mules alive, so that we will not have to kill any livestock.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So they divided the land between them to explore it; Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now as Obadiah was on his way, suddenly Elijah met him; and he recognized him, and fell on his face, and said, &#8220;<i>Is</i> that you, my lord Elijah?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And he answered him, &#8220;<i>It is</i> I. Go, tell your master, &#8216;Elijah <i>is here.</i>&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So he said, &#8220;How have I sinned, that you are delivering your servant into the hand of Ahab, to kill me? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><i>As</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom where my master has not sent someone to hunt for you; and when they said, &#8216;<i>He is</i> not <i>here,</i>&#8217; he took an oath from the kingdom or nation that they could not find you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And now you say, &#8216;Go, tell your master, &#8220;Elijah <i>is here</i>&#8221; &#8217;! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And it shall come to pass, <i>as soon as</i> I am gone from you, that the Spirit of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will carry you to a place I do not know; so when I go and tell Ahab, and he cannot find you, he will kill me. But I your servant have feared the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> from my youth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Was it not reported to my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, how I hid one hundred men of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s prophets, fifty to a cave, and fed them with bread and water? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And now you say, &#8216;Go, tell your master, &#8220;Elijah <i>is here.</i>&#8221; &#8217; He will kill me!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then Elijah said, &#8220;<i>As</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will surely present myself to him today.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then it happened, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to him, &#8220;<i>Is that</i> you, O troubler of Israel?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And he answered, &#8220;I have not troubled Israel, but you and your father&#8217;s house <i>have,</i> in that you have forsaken the commandments of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and have followed the Baals. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Now therefore, send <i>and</i> gather all Israel to me on Mount Carmel, the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal, and the four hundred prophets of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Asherah, who <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>eat at Jezebel&#8217;s table.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Elijah&#8217;s Mount Carmel Victory</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-20"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So Ahab sent for all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together on Mount Carmel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And Elijah came to all the people, and said, &#8220;How long will you falter between two opinions? If the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>is</i> God, follow Him; but if Baal, follow him.&#8221; But the people answered him not a word. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then Elijah said to the people, &#8220;I alone am left a prophet of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; but Baal&#8217;s prophets <i>are</i> four hundred and fifty men. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Therefore let them give us two bulls; and let them choose one bull for themselves, cut it in pieces, and lay <i>it</i> on the wood, but put no fire <i>under it;</i> and I will prepare the other bull, and lay <i>it</i> on the wood, but put no fire <i>under it.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then you call on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; and the God who answers by fire, He is God.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-24">So all the people answered and said, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>&#8220;It is well spoken.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Now Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, &#8220;Choose one bull for yourselves and prepare <i>it</i> first, for you <i>are</i> many; and call on the name of your god, but put no fire <i>under it.</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>So they took the bull which was given them, and they prepared <i>it,</i> and called on the name of Baal from morning even till noon, saying, &#8220;O Baal, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>hear us!&#8221; But <i>there was</i> no voice; no one answered. Then they <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>leaped about the altar which they had made.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And so it was, at noon, that Elijah mocked them and said, &#8220;Cry <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>aloud, for he <i>is</i> a god; either he is meditating, or he is busy, or he is on a journey, <i>or</i> perhaps he is sleeping and must be awakened.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>So they cried aloud, and cut themselves, as was their custom, with <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>knives and lances, until the blood gushed out on them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And when midday was past, they prophesied until the <i>time</i> of the offering of the <i>evening</i> sacrifice. But <i>there was</i> no voice; no one answered, no one paid attention.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Then Elijah said to all the people, &#8220;Come near to me.&#8221; So all the people came near to him. And he repaired the altar of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>that was</i> broken down. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had come, saying, &#8220;Israel shall be your name.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Then with the stones he built an altar in the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; and he made a trench around the altar large enough to hold two seahs of seed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And he put the wood in order, cut the bull in pieces, and laid <i>it</i> on the wood, and said, &#8220;Fill four waterpots with water, and pour <i>it</i> on the burnt sacrifice and on the wood.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Then he said, &#8220;Do <i>it</i> a second time,&#8221; and they did <i>it</i> a second time; and he said, &#8220;Do <i>it</i> a third time,&#8221; and they did <i>it</i> a third time. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>So the water ran all around the altar; and he also filled the trench with water.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>And it came to pass, at <i>the time of</i> the offering of the <i>evening</i> sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near and said, &#8220;<span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that You <i>are</i> God in Israel and I <i>am</i> Your servant, and <i>that</i> I have done all these things at Your word. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>Hear me, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, hear me, that this people may know that You <i>are</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God, and <i>that</i> You have turned their hearts back <i>to You</i> again.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>Then the fire of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood and the stones and the dust, and it licked up the water that <i>was</i> in the trench. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>Now when all the people saw <i>it,</i> they fell on their faces; and they said, &#8220;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, He <i>is</i> God! The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, He <i>is</i> God!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>And Elijah said to them, &#8220;Seize the prophets of Baal! Do not let one of them escape!&#8221; So they seized them; and Elijah brought them down to the Brook Kishon and executed them there.</span></p> <h3>
The Drought Ends</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-41"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>Then Elijah said to Ahab, &#8220;Go up, eat and drink; for <i>there is</i> the sound of abundance of rain.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>So Ahab went up to eat and drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; then he bowed down on the ground, and put his face between his knees, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>and said to his servant, &#8220;Go up now, look toward the sea.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-43">So he went up and looked, and said, &#8220;<i>There is</i> nothing.&#8221; And seven times he said, &#8220;Go again.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>Then it came to pass the seventh <i>time,</i> that he said, &#8220;There is a cloud, as small as a man&#8217;s hand, rising out of the sea!&#8221; So he said, &#8220;Go up, say to Ahab, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>&#8216;Prepare <i>your chariot,</i> and go down before the rain stops you.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>Now it happened in the meantime that the sky became black with clouds and wind, and there was a heavy rain. So Ahab rode away and went to Jezreel. </span>
