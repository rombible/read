<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Joshua called for all Israel, for their elders, for their heads, for their judges, and for their officers, and said to them:</span></p><p><span class="text Josh-23-2">&#8220;I am old, advanced in age. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>You have seen all that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God has done to all these nations because of you, for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God <i>is</i> He who has fought for you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>See, I have divided to you by lot these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from the Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, as far as the Great Sea westward. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God will expel them from before you and drive them out of your sight. So you shall possess their land, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God promised you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Therefore be very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, lest you turn aside from it to the right hand or to the left, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span><i>and</i> lest you go<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span> among these nations, these who remain among you. You shall not make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause <i>anyone</i> to swear <i>by them;</i> you shall not serve them nor bow down to them, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>but you shall hold fast to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God, as you have done to this day. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>driven out from before you great and strong nations; but <i>as for</i> you, no one has been able to stand against you to this day. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>One man of you shall chase a thousand, for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God <i>is</i> He who fights for you, as He promised you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Therefore take careful heed to yourselves, that you love the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Or else, if indeed you do go back, and cling to the remnant of these nations&#8212;these that remain among you&#8212;and make marriages with them, and go in to them and they to you, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>know for certain that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God will no longer drive out these nations from before you. But they shall be snares and traps to you, and scourges on your sides and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from this good land which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God has given you.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>&#8220;Behold, this day I<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> <i>am</i> going the way of all the earth. And you know in all your hearts and in all your souls that not one thing has failed of all the good things which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God spoke concerning you. All have come to pass for you; not one word of them has failed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all the good things have come upon you which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God promised you, so the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will bring upon you all harmful things, until He has destroyed you from this good land which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God has given you. </span>
