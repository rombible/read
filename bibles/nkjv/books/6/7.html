<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which <i>is</i> beside Beth Aven, on the east side of Bethel, and spoke to them, saying, &#8220;Go up and spy out the country.&#8221; So the men went up and spied out Ai. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And they returned to Joshua and said to him, &#8220;Do not let all the people go up, but let about two or three thousand men go up and attack Ai. Do not weary all the people there, for <i>the people of Ai are</i> few.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So about three thousand men went up there from the people, but they fled before the men of Ai. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And the men of Ai struck down about thirty-six men, for they chased them <i>from</i> before the gate as far as Shebarim, and struck them down on the descent; therefore the<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span> hearts of the people melted and became like water.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then Joshua tore his clothes, and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> until evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust on their heads. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And Joshua said, &#8220;Alas, Lord <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span><span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>, why have You brought this people over the Jordan at all&#8212;to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? Oh, that we had been content, and dwelt on the other side of the Jordan! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>O Lord, what shall I say when Israel turns its <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>back before its enemies? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear <i>it,</i> and surround us, and cut off our name from the earth. Then what will You do for Your great name?&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
The Sin of Achan</span></h3><p><span class="text Josh-7-10"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Joshua: &#8220;Get up! Why do you lie thus on your face? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Israel has sinned, and they have also transgressed My covenant which I commanded them. For they have even taken some of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>accursed things, and have both stolen and deceived; and they have also put <i>it</i> among their own stuff. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, <i>but</i> turned <i>their</i> backs before their enemies, because they have become doomed to destruction. Neither will I be with you anymore, unless you destroy the accursed from among you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Get up, sanctify<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span> the people, and say, &#8216;Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, because thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel: &#8220;<i>There is</i> an accursed thing in your midst, O Israel; you cannot stand before your enemies until you take away the accursed thing from among you.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>In the morning therefore you shall be brought according to your tribes. And it shall be <i>that</i> the tribe which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> takes shall come according to families; and the family which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> takes shall come by households; and the household which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> takes shall come man by man. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then it shall be <i>that</i> he who is taken with the accursed thing shall be burned with fire, he and all that he has, because he has transgressed<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span> the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and because he has done a disgraceful thing in Israel.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So Joshua rose early in the morning and brought Israel by their tribes, and the tribe of Judah was taken. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>He brought the clan of Judah, and he took the family of the Zarhites; and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man, and Zabdi was taken. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then he brought his household man by man, and Achan the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Now Joshua said to Achan, &#8220;My son, I beg you, give glory to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel, and make confession to Him, and tell me now what you have done; do not hide <i>it</i> from me.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And Achan answered Joshua and said, &#8220;Indeed I have sinned against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel, and this is what I have done: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>When I saw among the spoils a beautiful Babylonian garment, two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold weighing fifty shekels, I <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>coveted them and took them. And there they are, hidden in the earth in the midst of my tent, with the silver under it.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and there it was, hidden in his tent, with the silver under it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And they took them from the midst of the tent, brought them to Joshua and to all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, the silver, the garment, the wedge of gold, his sons, his daughters, his oxen, his donkeys, his sheep, his tent, and all that he had, and they brought them to the Valley of Achor. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And Joshua said, &#8220;Why have you troubled us? The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will trouble you this day.&#8221; So all Israel stoned him with stones; and they burned them with fire after they had stoned them with stones.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Then they raised over him a great heap of stones, still there to this day. So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> turned from the fierceness of His anger. Therefore the name of that place has been called the Valley of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span>Achor to this day.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-5978a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 7:1">Joshua 7:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>acted unfaithfully</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-5978b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 7:1">Joshua 7:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>devoted</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-5978c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 7:1">Joshua 7:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Zimri,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="1Chr.2.6" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=1Chr.2.6&amp;version=NKJV">1 Chr. 2:6</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-5982d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 7:5">Joshua 7:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>the people&#8217;s courage failed</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-5984e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 7:7">Joshua 7:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. <i>YHWH, <span class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span></i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-5985f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 7:8">Joshua 7:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>neck</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-5988g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 7:11">Joshua 7:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>devoted</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-5990h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 7:13">Joshua 7:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>set apart</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-5992i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 7:15">Joshua 7:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>overstepped</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-5998j"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 7:21">Joshua 7:21</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>desired</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6003k"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 7:26">Joshua 7:26</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Trouble</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
