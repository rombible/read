<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and to the kings who <i>were</i> from the north, in the mountains, in the plain south of Chinneroth, in the lowland, and in the heights of Dor on the west, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>to the Canaanites in the east and in the west, the Amorite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Jebusite in the mountains, and the Hivite below Hermon in the land of Mizpah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So they went out, they and all their armies with them, <i>as</i> many people <i>as</i> the sand that <i>is</i> on the seashore in multitude, with very many horses and chariots. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And when all these kings had <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>met together, they came and camped together at the waters of Merom to fight against Israel.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Joshua, &#8220;Do not be afraid because of them, for tomorrow about this time I will deliver all of them slain before Israel. You shall hamstring their horses and burn their chariots with fire.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So Joshua and all the people of war with him came against them suddenly by the waters of Merom, and they attacked them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> delivered them into the hand of Israel, who defeated them and chased them to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>Greater Sidon, to the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Brook Misrephoth, and to the Valley of Mizpah eastward; they attacked them until they left none of them remaining. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So Joshua did to them as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had told him: he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots with fire.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Joshua turned back at that time and took Hazor, and struck its king with the sword; for Hazor was formerly the head of all those kingdoms. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And they struck all the people who <i>were</i> in it with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying <i>them.</i> There was none left breathing. Then he burned Hazor with fire.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So all the cities of those kings, and all their kings, Joshua took and struck with the edge of the sword. He utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had commanded. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>But <i>as for</i> the cities that stood on their <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>mounds, Israel burned none of them, except Hazor only, <i>which</i> Joshua burned. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/11-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And all the spoil of these cities and the livestock, the children of Israel took as booty for themselves; but they struck every man with the edge of the sword until they had destroyed them, and they left none breathing. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/11-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>As the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had commanded Moses His servant, so Moses commanded Joshua, and so Joshua did. <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>He left nothing undone of all that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had commanded Moses.</span></p> <h3>
Summary of Joshua&#8217;s Conquests</span></h3><p><span class="text Josh-11-16"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/11-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Thus Joshua took all this land: the mountain country, all the South, all the land of Goshen, the lowland, and the Jordan <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>plain&#8212;the mountains of Israel and its lowlands, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/11-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>from <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>Mount Halak and the ascent to Seir, even as far as Baal Gad in the Valley of Lebanon below Mount Hermon. He captured all their kings, and struck them down and killed them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/11-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Joshua made war a long time with all those kings. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/11-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, except the Hivites, the inhabitants of Gibeon. All <i>the others</i> they took in battle. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/11-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>For it was of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that He might utterly destroy them, <i>and</i> that they might receive no mercy, but that He might destroy them, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had commanded Moses.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/11-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And at that time Joshua came and cut off the Anakim from the mountains: from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel; Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/11-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>None of the Anakim were left in the land of the children of Israel; they remained only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/11-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had said to Moses; and Joshua gave it as an inheritance to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. Then the land rested from war.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-6113a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 11:5">Joshua 11:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>assembled by appointment</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6116b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 11:8">Joshua 11:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. <i>Sidon Rabbah</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6116c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 11:8">Joshua 11:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. <i>Misrephoth Maim,</i> lit. <i>Burnings of Water</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6121d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 11:13">Joshua 11:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. <i>tel,</i> a heap of successive city ruins</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6123e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 11:15">Joshua 11:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>He turned aside from nothing</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6124f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 11:16">Joshua 11:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. <i>arabah</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6125g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 11:17">Joshua 11:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>The Smooth</i> or <i>Bald Mountain</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6128h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 11:20">Joshua 11:20</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>to make strong</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
