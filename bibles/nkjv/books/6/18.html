And the land was subdued before them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/18-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>But there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes which had not yet received their inheritance.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/18-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then Joshua said to the children of Israel: &#8220;How long will you neglect to go and possess the land which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of your fathers has given you? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/18-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Pick out from among you three men for <i>each</i> tribe, and I will send them; they shall rise and go through the land, survey it according to their inheritance, and come <i>back</i> to me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/18-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And they shall divide it into seven parts. Judah shall remain in their territory on the south, and the house of Joseph shall remain in their territory on the north. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/18-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>You shall therefore <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>survey the land in seven parts and bring <i>the survey</i> here to me, that I may cast lots for you here before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/18-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But the Levites have no part among you, for the priesthood of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>is</i> their inheritance. And Gad, Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> gave them.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/18-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then the men arose to go away; and Joshua charged those who went to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>survey the land, saying, &#8220;Go, walk through the land, survey it, and come back to me, that I may cast lots for you here before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> in Shiloh.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/18-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So the men went, passed through the land, and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>wrote the survey in a book in seven parts by cities; and they came to Joshua at the camp in Shiloh. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/18-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and there Joshua divided the land to the children of Israel according to their <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>divisions.</span></p> <h3>
The Land of Benjamin</span></h3><p><span class="text Josh-18-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/18-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families, and the territory of their lot came out between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/18-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Their border on the north side began at the Jordan, and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north, and went up through the mountains westward; it ended at the Wilderness of Beth Aven. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/18-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>The border went over from there toward Luz, to the side of Luz (which <i>is</i> Bethel) southward; and the border descended to Ataroth Addar, near the hill that <i>lies</i> on the south side of Lower Beth Horon.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/18-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then the border extended around the west side to the south, from the hill that <i>lies</i> before Beth Horon southward; and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>it ended at Kirjath Baal (which <i>is</i> Kirjath Jearim), a city of the children of Judah. This <i>was</i> the west side.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/18-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>The south side <i>began</i> at the end of Kirjath Jearim, and the border extended on the west and went out to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/18-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then the border came down to the end of the mountain that <i>lies</i> before the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, which <i>is</i> in the Valley of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>Rephaim on the north, descended to the Valley of Hinnom, to the side of the Jebusite <i>city</i> on the south, and descended to En Rogel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/18-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And it went around from the north, went out to En Shemesh, and extended toward Geliloth, which is before the Ascent of Adummim, and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/18-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then it passed along toward the north side of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>Arabah, and went down to Arabah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/18-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And the border passed along to the north side of Beth Hoglah; then <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>the border ended at the north bay at the Salt Sea, at the south end of the Jordan. This <i>was</i> the southern boundary.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/18-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>The Jordan was its border on the east side. This <i>was</i> the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, according to its boundaries all around, according to their families.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/18-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin, according to their families, were Jericho, Beth Hoglah, Emek Keziz, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/18-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Beth Arabah, Zemaraim, Bethel, </span>
