<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Moses My servant is dead. Now therefore, arise, go over this Jordan, you and all this people, to the land which I am giving to them&#8212;the children of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Every place that the sole of your foot will tread upon I have given you, as I said to Moses. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>From the wilderness and this Lebanon as far as the great river, the River Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and to the Great Sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your territory. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>No man shall <i>be able to</i> stand before you all the days of your life; as I was with Moses, <i>so</i> I will be with you. I will not leave you nor forsake you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Be strong and of good courage, for to this people you shall <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>divide as an inheritance the land which I swore to their fathers to give them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Only be strong and very courageous, that you may observe to do according to all the law which Moses My servant commanded you; do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>prosper wherever you go. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> shall meditate in it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Have I not commanded you? Be strong and of good courage; do not be afraid, nor be dismayed, for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God <i>is</i> with you wherever you go.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
The Order to Cross the Jordan</span></h3><p><span class="text Josh-1-10"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8220;Pass through the camp and command the people, saying, &#8216;Prepare provisions for yourselves, for within three days you will cross over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God is giving you to possess.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh Joshua spoke, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8220;Remember the word which Moses the servant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> commanded you, saying, &#8216;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God is giving you rest and is giving you this land.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Your wives, your little ones, and your livestock shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan. But you shall <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>pass before your brethren armed, all your mighty men of valor, and help them, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>until the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has given your brethren rest, as He <i>gave</i> you, and they also have taken possession of the land which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God is giving them. Then you shall return to the land of your possession and enjoy it, which Moses the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s servant gave you on this side of the Jordan toward the sunrise.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So they answered Joshua, saying, &#8220;All that you command us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Just as we heeded Moses in all things, so we will heed you. Only the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God be with you, as He was with Moses. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/1-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Whoever rebels against your command and does not heed your words, in all that you command him, shall be put to death. Only be strong and of good courage.&#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-5858a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 1:6">Joshua 1:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>give as a possession</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-5859b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 1:7">Joshua 1:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>have success</i> or <i>act wisely</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-5860c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 1:8">Joshua 1:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>you shall be constantly in</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-5866d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 1:14">Joshua 1:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>cross over ahead of</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
