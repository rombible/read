<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>that they feared greatly, because Gibeon <i>was</i> a great city, like one of the royal cities, and because it <i>was</i> greater than Ai, and all its men <i>were</i> mighty. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Therefore Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, Piram king of Jarmuth, Japhia king of Lachish, and Debir king of Eglon, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8220;Come up to me and help me, that we may attack Gibeon, for it has made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, <i>and</i> the king of Eglon, gathered together and went up, they and all their armies, and camped before Gibeon and made war against it.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua at the camp at Gilgal, saying, &#8220;Do not forsake your servants; come up to us quickly, save us and help us, for all the kings of the Amorites who dwell in the mountains have gathered together against us.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Joshua, &#8220;Do not fear them, for I have delivered them into your hand; not a man of them shall stand before you.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Joshua therefore came upon them suddenly, having marched all night from Gilgal. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> routed them before Israel, killed them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, chased them along the road that goes to Beth Horon, and struck them down as far as Azekah and Makkedah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And it happened, as they fled before Israel <i>and</i> were on the descent of Beth Horon, that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> cast down large hailstones from heaven on them as far as Azekah, and they died. <i>There were</i> more who died from the hailstones than the children of Israel killed with the sword.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then Joshua spoke to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> in the day when the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Josh-10-12">&#8220;Sun, stand still over Gibeon;</span><br /><span class="text Josh-10-12">And Moon, in the Valley of Aijalon.&#8221;</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So the sun stood still,</span><br /><span class="text Josh-10-13">And the moon stopped,</span><br /><span class="text Josh-10-13">Till the people had revenge</span><br /><span class="text Josh-10-13">Upon their enemies.</span></p></div><p class="first-line-none top-1"><span class="text Josh-10-13"><i>Is</i> this not written in the Book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and did not hasten to go <i>down</i> for about a whole day. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And there has been no day like that, before it or after it, that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> heeded the voice of a man; for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> fought for Israel.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.</span></p> <h3>
The Amorite Kings Executed</span></h3><p><span class="text Josh-10-16"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But these five kings had fled and hidden themselves in a cave at Makkedah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And it was told Joshua, saying, &#8220;The five kings have been found hidden in the cave at Makkedah.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>So Joshua said, &#8220;Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to guard them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And do not stay <i>there</i> yourselves, <i>but</i> pursue your enemies, and attack their rear <i>guard.</i> Do not allow them to enter their cities, for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God has delivered them into your hand.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then it happened, while Joshua and the children of Israel made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they had finished, that those who escaped entered fortified cities. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And all the people returned to the camp, to Joshua at Makkedah, in peace.</span></p><p><span class="text Josh-10-21">No one <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then Joshua said, &#8220;Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings to me from the cave.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And they did so, and brought out those five kings to him from the cave: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, <i>and</i> the king of Eglon.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>So it was, when they brought out those kings to Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said to the captains of the men of war who went with him, &#8220;Come near, put your feet on the necks of these kings.&#8221; And they drew near and put their feet on their necks. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then Joshua said to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>them, &#8220;Do not be afraid, nor be dismayed; be strong and of good courage, for thus the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will do to all your enemies against whom you fight.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And afterward Joshua struck <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>them and killed them, and hanged them on five trees; and they were hanging on the trees until evening. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>So it was at the time of the going down of the sun <i>that</i> Joshua commanded, and they took them down from the trees, cast them into the cave where they had been hidden, and laid large stones against the cave&#8217;s mouth, <i>which remain</i> until this very day.</span></p> <h3>
Conquest of the Southland</span></h3><p><span class="text Josh-10-28"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>On that day Joshua took Makkedah, and struck it and its king with the edge of the sword. He utterly destroyed <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>them&#8212;all the people who <i>were</i> in it. He let none remain. He also did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, to Libnah; and they fought against Libnah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> also delivered it and its king into the hand of Israel; he struck it and all the people who <i>were</i> in it with the edge of the sword. He let none remain in it, but did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Then Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, to Lachish; and they encamped against it and fought against it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, who took it on the second day, and struck it and all the people who <i>were</i> in it with the edge of the sword, according to all that he had done to Libnah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua struck him and his people, until he left him none remaining.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>From Lachish Joshua passed to Eglon, and all Israel with him; and they encamped against it and fought against it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>They took it on that day and struck it with the edge of the sword; all the people who <i>were</i> in it he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>So Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, to Hebron; and they fought against it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>And they took it and struck it with the edge of the sword&#8212;its king, all its cities, and all the people who <i>were</i> in it; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon, but utterly destroyed it and all the people who <i>were</i> in it.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>Then Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and they fought against it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>And he took it and its king and all its cities; they struck them with the edge of the sword and utterly destroyed all the people who <i>were</i> in it. He left none remaining; as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir and its king, as he had done also to Libnah and its king.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>So Joshua conquered all the land: the mountain country and the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>South and the lowland and the wilderness slopes, and all their kings; he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel had commanded. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>And Joshua conquered them from Kadesh Barnea as far as Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even as far as Gibeon. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>All these kings and their land Joshua took at one time, because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel fought for Israel. </span>
