<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/17-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And there was <i>a lot</i> for the rest of the children of Manasseh according to their families: for the children of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>Abiezer, the children of Helek, the children of Asriel, the children of Shechem, the children of Hepher, and the children of Shemida; these <i>were</i> the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph according to their families.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/17-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But Zelophehad the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but only daughters. And these <i>are</i> the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/17-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And they came near before Eleazar the priest, before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the rulers, saying, &#8220;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> commanded Moses to give us an <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>inheritance among our brothers.&#8221; Therefore, according to the commandment of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, he gave them an inheritance among their father&#8217;s brothers. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/17-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Ten shares fell to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which <i>were</i> on the other side of the Jordan, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/17-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>because the daughters of Manasseh received an inheritance among his sons; and the rest of Manasseh&#8217;s sons had the land of Gilead.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/17-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And the territory of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethath, that <i>lies</i> east of Shechem; and the border went along south to the inhabitants of En Tappuah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/17-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Manasseh had the land of Tappuah, but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh <i>belonged</i> to the children of Ephraim. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/17-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>border descended to the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>Brook Kanah, southward to the brook. These cities of Ephraim <i>are</i> among the cities of Manasseh. The border of Manasseh <i>was</i> on the north side of the brook; and it ended at the sea.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/17-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Southward <i>it was</i> Ephraim&#8217;s, northward <i>it was</i> Manasseh&#8217;s, and the sea was its border. Manasseh&#8217;s territory was adjoining Asher on the north and Issachar on the east. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/17-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And in Issachar and in Asher, Manasseh had Beth Shean and its towns, Ibleam and its towns, the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, the inhabitants of En Dor and its towns, the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns&#8212;three hilly regions. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/17-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out <i>the inhabitants of</i> those cities, but the Canaanites were determined to dwell in that land. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/17-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And it happened, when the children of Israel grew strong, that they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but did not utterly drive them out.</span></p> <h3>
More Land for Ephraim and Manasseh</span></h3><p><span class="text Josh-17-14"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/17-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then the children of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, &#8220;Why have you given us <i>only</i> one <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>lot and one share to inherit, since we <i>are</i> a great people, inasmuch as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has blessed us until now?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/17-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So Joshua answered them, &#8220;If you <i>are</i> a great people, <i>then</i> go up to the forest <i>country</i> and clear a place for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and the giants, since the mountains of Ephraim are too confined for you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/17-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But the children of Joseph said, &#8220;The mountain country is not enough for us; and all the Canaanites who dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, <i>both those</i> who <i>are</i> of Beth Shean and its towns and <i>those</i> who <i>are</i> of the Valley of Jezreel.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/17-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph&#8212;to Ephraim and Manasseh&#8212;saying, &#8220;You <i>are</i> a great people and have great power; you shall not have <i>only</i> one <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>lot, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/17-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>but the mountain country shall be yours.
