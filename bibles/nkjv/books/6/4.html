<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Take for yourselves twelve men from the people, one man from every tribe, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and command them, saying, &#8216;Take for yourselves twelve stones from here, out of the midst of the Jordan, from the place where the priests&#8217; feet stood firm. You shall carry them over with you and leave them in the lodging place where you lodge tonight.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then Joshua called the twelve men whom he had appointed from the children of Israel, one man from every tribe; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and Joshua said to them: &#8220;Cross over before the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God into the midst of the Jordan, and each one of you take up a stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>that this may be a sign among you when your children ask in time to come, saying, &#8216;What do these stones <i>mean</i> to you?&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then you shall answer them that the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; when it crossed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. And these stones shall be for a memorial to the children of Israel forever.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And the children of Israel did so, just as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones from the midst of the Jordan, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had spoken to Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, and carried them over with them to the place where they lodged, and laid them down there. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant stood; and they are there to this day.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So the priests who bore the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan until everything was finished that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had commanded Joshua to speak to the people, according to all that Moses had commanded Joshua; and the people hurried and crossed over. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then it came to pass, when all the people had completely crossed over, that the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and the priests crossed over in the presence of the people. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And the men of Reuben, the men of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh crossed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses had spoken to them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>About forty thousand <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>prepared for war crossed over before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> for battle, to the plains of Jericho. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>On that day the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> exalted<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span> Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they had feared Moses, all the days of his life.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Joshua, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>&#8220;Command the priests who bear the ark of the Testimony to come up from the Jordan.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, &#8220;Come up from the Jordan.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And it came to pass, when the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had come from the midst of the Jordan, <i>and</i> the soles of the priests&#8217; feet touched the dry land, that the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and overflowed all its banks as before.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Now the people came up from the Jordan on the tenth <i>day</i> of the first month, and they camped in Gilgal on the east border of Jericho. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And those twelve stones which they took out of the Jordan, Joshua set up in Gilgal. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then he spoke to the children of Israel, saying: &#8220;When your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, &#8216;What <i>are</i> these stones?&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>then you shall let your children know, saying, &#8216;Israel crossed over this Jordan on dry land&#8217;; </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/4-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>that all the peoples of the earth may know the hand of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, that it <i>is</i> mighty, that you may fear the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>forever.&#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-5924a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 4:13">Joshua 4:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>equipped</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-5925b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 4:14">Joshua 4:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>made Joshua great</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-5935c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 4:24">Joshua 4:24</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>all days</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
