<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and said to them: &#8220;You have kept all that Moses the servant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> commanded you, and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>You have not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>left your brethren these many days, up to this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And now the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God has given rest to your brethren, as He promised them; now therefore, return and go to your tents <i>and</i> to the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> gave you on the other side of the Jordan. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But take<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span> careful heed to do the commandment and the law which Moses the servant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> commanded you, to love the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God, to walk in all His ways, to keep His commandments, to hold fast to Him, and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So Joshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went to their tents.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now to half the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given a possession in Bashan, but to the <i>other</i> half of it Joshua gave <i>a possession</i> among their brethren on this side of the Jordan, westward. And indeed, when Joshua sent them away to their tents, he blessed them, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>and spoke to them, saying, &#8220;Return with much riches to your tents, with very much livestock, with silver, with gold, with bronze, with iron, and with very much clothing. Divide the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>spoil of your enemies with your brethren.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So the children of Reuben, the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel at Shiloh, which <i>is</i> in the land of Canaan, to go to the country of Gilead, to the land of their possession, which they had obtained according to the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> by the hand of Moses.</span></p> <h3>
An Altar by the Jordan</span></h3><p><span class="text Josh-22-10"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And when they came to the region of the Jordan which <i>is</i> in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben, the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh built an altar there by the Jordan&#8212;a great, impressive altar. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now the children of Israel heard <i>someone</i> say, &#8220;Behold, the children of Reuben, the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh have built an altar on the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>frontier of the land of Canaan, in the region of the Jordan&#8212;on the children of Israel&#8217;s side.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And when the children of Israel heard <i>of it,</i> the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered together at Shiloh to go to war against them.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then the children of Israel sent Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest to the children of Reuben, to the children of Gad, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then they came to the children of Reuben, to the children of Gad, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead, and they spoke with them, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>&#8220;Thus says the whole congregation of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8216;What treachery<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span> <i>is</i> this that you have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, in that you have built for yourselves an altar, that you might rebel this day against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span><i>Is</i> the iniquity of Peor not enough for us, from which we are not cleansed till this day, although there was a plague in the congregation of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>but that you must turn away this day from following the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>? And it shall be, if you rebel today against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, that tomorrow He will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>Nevertheless, if the land of your possession <i>is</i> unclean, <i>then</i> cross over to the land of the possession of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, where the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s tabernacle stands, and take possession among us; but do not rebel against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, nor rebel against us, by building yourselves an altar besides the altar of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Did not Achan the son of Zerah <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>commit a trespass in the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel?

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then the children of Reuben, the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh answered and said to the heads of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>divisions of Israel: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>&#8220;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of gods, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of gods, He knows, and let Israel itself know&#8212;if <i>it is</i> in rebellion, or if in treachery against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, do not save us this day. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>If we have built ourselves an altar to turn from following the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, or if to offer on it burnt offerings or grain offerings, or if to offer peace offerings on it, let the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> Himself require <i>an account.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>But in fact we have done it <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span>for fear, for a reason, saying, &#8216;In time to come your descendants may speak to our descendants, saying, &#8220;What have you to do with the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>For the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has made the Jordan a border between you and us, <i>you</i> children of Reuben and children of Gad.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Therefore we said, &#8216;Let us now prepare to build ourselves an altar, not for burnt offering nor for sacrifice, </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Therefore we said that it will be, when they say <i>this</i> to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say, &#8216;Here is the replica of the altar of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> which our fathers made, though not for burnt offerings nor for sacrifices; but it <i>is</i> a witness between you and us.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Far be it from us that we should rebel against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and turn from following the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> this day, to build an altar for burnt offerings, for grain offerings, or for sacrifices, besides the altar of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God which <i>is</i> before His tabernacle.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Now when Phinehas the priest and the rulers of the congregation, the heads of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[m]</a></span>divisions of Israel who <i>were</i> with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben, the children of Gad, and the children of Manasseh spoke, it pleased them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Then Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the children of Reuben, the children of Gad, and the children of Manasseh, &#8220;This day we perceive that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>is</i> among us, because you have not committed this treachery against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the rulers, returned from the children of Reuben and the children of Gad, from the land of Gilead to the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought back word to them. </span>
