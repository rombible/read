<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Joshua said to all the people, &#8220;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel: &#8216;Your fathers, <i>including</i> Terah, the father of Abraham and the father of Nahor, dwelt on the other side of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>the River in old times; and they served other gods. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then I took your father Abraham from the other side of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>the River, led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>descendants and gave him Isaac. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>To Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. To Esau I gave the mountains of Seir to possess, but Jacob and his children went down to Egypt. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Also I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to what I did among them. Afterward I brought you out.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>&#8216;Then I brought your fathers out of Egypt, and you came to the sea; and the Egyptians pursued your fathers with chariots and horsemen to the Red Sea. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So they cried out to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; and He put darkness between you and the Egyptians, brought the sea upon them, and covered them. And your eyes saw what I did in Egypt. Then you dwelt in the wilderness a long time. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, who dwelt on the other side of the Jordan, and they fought with you. But I gave them into your hand, that you might possess their land, and I destroyed them from before you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose to make war against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>But I would not listen to Balaam; therefore he continued to bless you. So I delivered you out of his hand. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then you went over the Jordan and came to Jericho. And the men of Jericho fought against you&#8212;<i>also</i> the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. But I delivered them into your hand. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>I sent the hornet before you which drove them out from before you, <i>also</i> the two kings of the Amorites, <i>but</i> not with your sword or with your bow. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>I have given you a land for which you did not labor, and cities which you did not build, and you dwell in them; you eat of the vineyards and olive groves which you did not plant.&#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>&#8220;Now therefore, fear the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, serve Him in sincerity and in truth, and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>the River and in Egypt. Serve the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And if it seems evil to you to serve the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve, whether the gods which your fathers served that <i>were</i> on the other side of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell. But as for me and my house, we will serve the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So the people answered and said: &#8220;Far be it from us that we should forsake the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> to serve other gods; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God <i>is</i> He who brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, who did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way that we went and among all the people through whom we passed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> drove out from before us all the people, including the Amorites who dwelt in the land. We also will serve the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, for He <i>is</i> our God.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>But Joshua said to the people, &#8220;You cannot serve the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, for He <i>is</i> a holy God. He <i>is</i> a jealous God; He will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>If you forsake the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and serve foreign gods, then He will turn and do you harm and consume you, after He has done you good.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And the people said to Joshua, &#8220;No, but we will serve the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So Joshua said to the people, &#8220;You <i>are</i> witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> for yourselves, to serve Him.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Josh-24-22">And they said, &#8220;<i>We are</i> witnesses!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>&#8220;Now therefore,&#8221; <i>he said,</i> &#8220;put away the foreign gods which <i>are</i> among you, and incline your heart to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And the people said to Joshua, &#8220;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God we will serve, and His voice we will obey!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>So Joshua made<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span> a covenant with the people that day, and made for them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Then Joshua wrote these words in the Book of the Law of God. And he took a large stone, and set it up there under the oak that <i>was</i> by the sanctuary of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And Joshua said to all the people, &#8220;Behold, this stone shall be a witness to us, for it has heard all the words of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> which He spoke to us. It shall therefore be a witness to you, lest you deny your God.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>So Joshua let the people depart, each to his own inheritance.</span></p> <h3>
Death of Joshua and Eleazar</span></h3><p><span class="text Josh-24-29"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Now it came to pass after these things that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, died, <i>being</i> one hundred and ten years old. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And they buried him within the border of his inheritance at Timnath Serah, which <i>is</i> in the mountains of Ephraim, on the north side of Mount Gaash.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Israel served the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had known all the works of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> which He had done for Israel.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>The bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel had brought up out of Egypt, they buried at Shechem, in the plot of ground which Jacob had bought from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for one hundred <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>pieces of silver, and which had become an inheritance of the children of Joseph.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And Eleazar the son of Aaron died.
