<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>At that time the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Joshua, &#8220;Make flint knives for yourself, and circumcise the sons of Israel again the second time.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So Joshua made flint knives for himself, and circumcised the sons of Israel at <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>the hill of the foreskins. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And this <i>is</i> the reason why Joshua circumcised them: All the people who came out of Egypt <i>who were</i> males, all the men of war, had died in the wilderness on the way, after they had come out of Egypt. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For all the people who came out had been circumcised, but all the people born in the wilderness, on the way as they came out of Egypt, had not been circumcised. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the people <i>who were</i> men of war, who came out of Egypt, were <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>consumed, because they did not obey the voice of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8212;to whom the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> swore that He would not show them the land which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had sworn to their fathers that He would give us, &#8220;a land flowing with milk and honey.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then Joshua circumcised their sons <i>whom</i> He raised up in their place; for they were uncircumcised, because they had not been circumcised on the way.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So it was, when they had finished circumcising all the people, that they stayed in their places in the camp till they were healed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Joshua, &#8220;This day I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you.&#8221; Therefore the name of the place is called Gilgal<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span> to this day.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Now the children of Israel camped in Gilgal, and kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at twilight on the plains of Jericho. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And they ate of the produce of the land on the day after the Passover, unleavened bread and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>parched grain, on the very same day. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then the manna ceased on the day after they had eaten the produce of the land; and the children of Israel no longer had manna, but they ate the food of the land of Canaan that year.</span></p> <h3>
The Commander of the Army of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span></span></h3><p><span class="text Josh-5-13"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/5-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted his eyes and looked, and behold, a Man stood opposite him with His sword drawn in His hand. And Joshua went to Him and said to Him, &#8220;<i>Are</i> You for us or for our adversaries?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/5-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So He said, &#8220;No, but <i>as</i> Commander of the army of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> I have now come.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Josh-5-14">And Joshua fell on his face to the earth and worshiped, and said to Him, &#8220;What does my Lord say to His servant?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/5-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then the Commander of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s army said to Joshua, &#8220;Take your sandal off your foot, for the place where you stand <i>is</i> holy.&#8221; And Joshua did so.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-5936a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 5:1">Joshua 5:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>So with Kt.; Qr., some Heb. mss. and editions, LXX, Syr., Tg., Vg. <i>they</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-5936b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 5:1">Joshua 5:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>their courage failed</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-5938c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 5:3">Joshua 5:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. <i>Gibeath Haaraloth</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-5941d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 5:6">Joshua 5:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>destroyed</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-5944e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 5:9">Joshua 5:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Rolling</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-5946f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 5:11">Joshua 5:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>roasted</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
