<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, &#8220;Behold, men have come here tonight from the children of Israel to search out the country.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, &#8220;Bring out the men who have come to you, who have entered your house, for they have come to search out all the country.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then the woman took the two men and hid them. So she said, &#8220;Yes, the men came to me, but I did not know where they <i>were</i> from. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And it happened as the gate was being shut, when it was dark, that the men went out. Where the men went I do not know; pursue them quickly, for you may overtake them.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>(But she had brought them up to the roof and hidden them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order on the roof.) </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then the men pursued them by the road to the Jordan, to the fords. And as soon as those who pursued them had gone out, they shut the gate.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Now before they lay down, she came up to them on the roof, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and said to the men: &#8220;I know that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has given you the land, that the terror of you has fallen on us, and that all the inhabitants of the land are fainthearted because of you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For we have heard how the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites who <i>were</i> on the other side of the Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom you utterly destroyed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And as soon as we heard <i>these things,</i> our hearts melted; neither did there remain any more courage in anyone because of you, for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God, He <i>is</i> God in heaven above and on earth beneath. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now therefore, I beg you, swear to me by the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, since I have shown you kindness, that you also will show kindness to my father&#8217;s house, and give me <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>a true token, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>and spare my father, my mother, my brothers, my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So the men answered her, &#8220;Our lives for yours, if none of you tell this business of ours. And it shall be, when the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then she let them down by a rope through the window, for her house <i>was</i> on the city wall; she dwelt on the wall. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And she said to them, &#8220;Get to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you. Hide there three days, until the pursuers have returned. Afterward you may go your way.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So the men said to her: &#8220;We <i>will be</i> blameless<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span> of this oath of yours which you have made us swear, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/2-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>unless, <i>when</i> we come into the land, you bind this line of scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down, and unless you <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>bring your father, your mother, your brothers, and all your father&#8217;s household to your own home. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/2-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>So it shall be <i>that</i> whoever goes outside the doors of your house into the street, his blood <i>shall be</i> on his own head, and we <i>will be</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>guiltless. And whoever is with you in the house, his <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>blood <i>shall be</i> on our head if a hand is laid on him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/2-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And if you tell this business of ours, then we will be <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>free from your oath which you made us swear.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/2-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then she said, &#8220;According to your words, so <i>be</i> it.&#8221; And she sent them away, and they departed. And she bound the scarlet cord in the window.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/2-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>They departed and went to the mountain, and stayed there three days until the pursuers returned. The pursuers sought <i>them</i> all along the way, but did not find <i>them.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/2-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>So the two men returned, descended from the mountain, and crossed over; and they came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all that had befallen them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/2-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And they said to Joshua, &#8220;Truly the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has delivered all the land into our hands, for indeed all the inhabitants of the country are fainthearted because of us.&#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-5871a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 2:1">Joshua 2:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. <i>Shittim</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-5871b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 2:1">Joshua 2:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>lay down</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-5882c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 2:12">Joshua 2:12</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>a pledge of truth</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-5887d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 2:17">Joshua 2:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>free from obligation to this oath</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-5888e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 2:18">Joshua 2:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>gather</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-5889f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 2:19">Joshua 2:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>free from obligation</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-5889g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 2:19">Joshua 2:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>guilt of bloodshed</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-5890h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 2:20">Joshua 2:20</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>free from obligation to</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
