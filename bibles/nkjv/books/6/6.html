<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Joshua: &#8220;See! I have given Jericho into your hand, its king, <i>and</i> the mighty men of valor. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>You shall march around the city, all <i>you</i> men of war; you shall go all around the city once. This you shall do six days. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams&#8217; horns before the ark. But the seventh day you shall march around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>It shall come to pass, when they make a long <i>blast</i> with the ram&#8217;s horn, <i>and</i> when you hear the sound of the trumpet, that all the people shall shout with a great shout; then the wall of the city will fall down flat. And the people shall go up every man straight before him.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and said to them, &#8220;Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams&#8217; horns before the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And he said to the people, &#8220;Proceed, and march around the city, and let him who is armed advance before the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So it was, when Joshua had spoken to the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams&#8217; horns before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> advanced and blew the trumpets, and the ark of the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> followed them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>The armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard came after the ark, while <i>the priests</i> continued blowing the trumpets. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Now Joshua had commanded the people, saying, &#8220;You shall not shout or make any noise with your voice, nor shall a word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I say to you, &#8216;Shout!&#8217; Then you shall shout.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So he had the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> circle the city, going around <i>it</i> once. Then they came into the camp and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>lodged in the camp.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams&#8217; horns before the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> went on continually and blew with the trumpets. And the armed men went before them. But the rear guard came after the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, while <i>the priests</i> continued blowing the trumpets. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And the second day they marched around the city once and returned to the camp. So they did six days.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But it came to pass on the seventh day that they rose early, about the dawning of the day, and marched around the city seven times in the same manner. On that day only they marched around the city seven times. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And the seventh time it happened, when the priests blew the trumpets, that Joshua said to the people: &#8220;Shout, for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has given you the city! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Now the city shall be doomed by the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> to destruction, it and all who <i>are</i> in it. Only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all who <i>are</i> with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And you, by all means abstain from the accursed things, lest you become accursed when you take of the accursed things, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>But all the silver and gold, and vessels of bronze and iron, <i>are</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>consecrated to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; they <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>shall come into the treasury of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So the people shouted when <i>the priests</i> blew the trumpets. And it happened when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat. Then the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And they utterly destroyed all that <i>was</i> in the city, both man and woman, young and old, ox and sheep and donkey, with the edge of the sword.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But Joshua had said to the two men who had spied out the country, &#8220;Go into the harlot&#8217;s house, and from there bring out the woman and all that she has, as you swore to her.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And the young men who had been spies went in and brought out Rahab, her father, her mother, her brothers, and all that she had. So they brought out all her relatives and left them outside the camp of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>But they burned the city and all that <i>was</i> in it with fire. Only the silver and gold, and the vessels of bronze and iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And Joshua spared Rahab the harlot, her father&#8217;s household, and all that she had. So she dwells in Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Then Joshua <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>charged <i>them</i> at that time, saying, &#8220;Cursed <i>be</i> the man before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> who rises up and builds this city Jericho; he shall lay its foundation with his firstborn, and with his youngest he shall set up its gates.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/6-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was with Joshua, and his fame spread throughout all the country.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-5961a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 6:11">Joshua 6:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>spent the night</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-5969b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 6:19">Joshua 6:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>set apart</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-5969c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 6:19">Joshua 6:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>shall go</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-5976d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 6:26">Joshua 6:26</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>warned</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
