<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>that they gathered together to fight with Joshua and Israel with one <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>accord.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>they worked craftily, and went and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>pretended to be ambassadors. And they took old sacks on their donkeys, old wineskins torn and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>mended, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>old and patched sandals on their feet, and old garments on themselves; and all the bread of their provision was dry <i>and</i> moldy. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And they went to Joshua, to the camp at Gilgal, and said to him and to the men of Israel, &#8220;We have come from a far country; now therefore, make a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>covenant with us.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then the men of Israel said to the Hivites, &#8220;Perhaps you dwell among us; so how can we make a covenant with you?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But they said to Joshua, &#8220;We <i>are</i> your servants.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Josh-9-8">And Joshua said to them, &#8220;Who <i>are</i> you, and where do you come from?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So they said to him: &#8220;From a very far country your servants have come, because of the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God; for we have heard of His fame, and all that He did in Egypt, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and all that He did to the two kings of the Amorites who <i>were</i> beyond the Jordan&#8212;to Sihon king of Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Therefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying, &#8216;Take provisions with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say to them, &#8220;We <i>are</i> your servants; now therefore, make a covenant with us.&#8221; &#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>This bread of ours we took hot <i>for</i> our provision from our houses on the day we departed to come to you. But now look, it is dry and moldy. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And these wineskins which we filled <i>were</i> new, and see, they are torn; and these our garments and our sandals have become old because of the very long journey.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/9-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then the men of Israel took some of their provisions; but they <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>did not ask counsel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them to let them live; and the rulers of the congregation swore to them.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/9-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And it happened at the end of three days, after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard that they <i>were</i> their neighbors who dwelt near them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/9-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then the children of Israel journeyed and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities <i>were</i> Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kirjath Jearim. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/9-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>But the children of Israel did not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>attack them, because the rulers of the congregation had sworn to them by the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel. And all the congregation complained against the rulers.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/9-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then all the rulers said to all the congregation, &#8220;We have sworn to them by the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel; now therefore, we may not touch them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/9-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>This we will do to them: We will let them live, lest wrath be upon us because of the oath which we swore to them.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/9-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And the rulers said to them, &#8220;Let them live, but let them be woodcutters and water carriers for all the congregation, as the rulers had promised them.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/9-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then Joshua called for them, and he spoke to them, saying, &#8220;Why have you deceived us, saying, &#8216;We <i>are</i> very far from you,&#8217; when you dwell near us? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/9-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Now therefore, you <i>are</i> cursed, and none of you shall be freed from being slaves&#8212;woodcutters and water carriers for the house of my God.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/9-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>So they answered Joshua and said, &#8220;Because your servants were clearly told that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God commanded His servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you; therefore we were very much afraid for our lives because of you, and have done this thing. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/9-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And now, here we are, in your hands; do with us as it seems good and right to do to us.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/9-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>So he did to them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, so that they did not kill them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/9-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And that day Joshua made them woodcutters and water carriers for the congregation and for the altar of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, in the place which He would choose, even to this day.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-6040a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 9:2">Joshua 9:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>mouth</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6042b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 9:4">Joshua 9:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>acted as envoys</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6042c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 9:4">Joshua 9:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>tied up</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6044d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 9:6">Joshua 9:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>treaty</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6052e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 9:14">Joshua 9:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>did not inquire at the mouth of</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6056f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 9:18">Joshua 9:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>strike</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
