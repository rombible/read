<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/14-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Their inheritance <i>was</i> by lot, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had commanded by the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes and the half-tribe. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/14-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe on the other side of the Jordan; but to the Levites he had given no inheritance among them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/14-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For the children of Joseph were two tribes: Manasseh and Ephraim. And they gave no part to the Levites in the land, except cities to dwell <i>in,</i> with their common-lands for their livestock and their property. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/14-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>As the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did; and they divided the land.</span></p> <h3>
Caleb Inherits Hebron</span></h3><p><span class="text Josh-14-6"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/14-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then the children of Judah came to Joshua in Gilgal. And Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him: &#8220;You know the word which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses the man of God concerning you and me in Kadesh Barnea. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/14-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>I <i>was</i> forty years old when Moses the servant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> sent me from Kadesh Barnea to spy out the land, and I brought back word to him as <i>it was</i> in my heart. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/14-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Nevertheless my brethren who went up with me made the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>heart of the people melt, but I wholly followed the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> my God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/14-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So Moses swore on that day, saying, &#8216;Surely the land where your foot has trodden shall be your inheritance and your children&#8217;s forever, because you have wholly followed the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> my God.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/14-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And now, behold, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has kept me alive, as He said, these forty-five years, ever since the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> spoke this word to Moses while Israel <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>wandered in the wilderness; and now, here I am this day, eighty-five years old. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/14-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>As yet I <i>am as</i> strong this day as on the day that Moses sent me; just as my strength <i>was</i> then, so now <i>is</i> my strength for war, both for going out and for coming in. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/14-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now therefore, give me this mountain of which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> spoke in that day; for you heard in that day how the Anakim <i>were</i> there, and <i>that</i> the cities <i>were</i> great <i>and</i> fortified. It may be that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>will be</i> with me, and I shall be able to drive them out as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/14-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And Joshua blessed him, and gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh as an inheritance. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/14-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day, because he wholly followed the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel. </span>
