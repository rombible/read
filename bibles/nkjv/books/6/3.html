<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So it was, after three days, that the officers went through the camp; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and they commanded the people, saying, &#8220;When you see the ark of the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God, and the priests, the Levites, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>bearing it, then you shall set out from your place and go after it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure. Do not come near it, that you may know the way by which you must go, for you have not passed <i>this</i> way before.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And Joshua said to the people, &#8220;Sanctify<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> yourselves, for tomorrow the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will do wonders among you.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, &#8220;Take up the ark of the covenant and cross over before the people.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Josh-3-6">So they took up the ark of the covenant and went before the people.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Joshua, &#8220;This day I will begin to exalt<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span> you in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, <i>so</i> I will be with you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>You shall command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, saying, &#8216;When you have come to the edge of the water of the Jordan, you shall stand in the Jordan.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So Joshua said to the children of Israel, &#8220;Come here, and hear the words of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And Joshua said, &#8220;By this you shall know that the living God <i>is</i> among you, and <i>that</i> He will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Hivites and the Perizzites and the Girgashites and the Amorites and the Jebusites: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is crossing over before you into the Jordan. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now therefore, take for yourselves twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one man from every tribe. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of the Jordan, <i>that</i> the waters of the Jordan shall be cut off, the waters that come down from upstream, and they shall stand as a heap.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So it was, when the people set out from their camp to cross over the Jordan, with the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and as those who bore the ark came to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests who bore the ark dipped in the edge of the water (for the Jordan overflows all its banks during the whole time of harvest), </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>that the waters which came down from upstream stood <i>still, and</i> rose in a heap very far away <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>at Adam, the city that <i>is</i> beside Zaretan. So the waters that went down into the Sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, failed, <i>and</i> were cut off; and the people crossed over opposite Jericho. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan; and all Israel crossed over on dry ground, until all the people had crossed completely over the Jordan.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-5895a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 3:1">Joshua 3:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. <i>Shittim</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-5897b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 3:3">Joshua 3:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>carrying</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-5899c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 3:5">Joshua 3:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Consecrate</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-5901d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 3:7">Joshua 3:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>make you great</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-5910e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Joshua 3:16">Joshua 3:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Qr., many mss. and vss. <i>from Adam</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
