<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Ahaz <i>was</i> twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem; and he did not do <i>what was</i> right in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> his God, as his father David <i>had done.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel; indeed he made his son pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had cast out from before the children of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, came up to Jerusalem to <i>make</i> war; and they besieged Ahaz but could not overcome <i>him.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>At that time Rezin king of Syria captured <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>Elath for Syria, and drove the men of Judah from Elath. Then the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>Edomites went to Elath, and dwell there to this day.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-Pileser<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> king of Assyria, saying, &#8220;I <i>am</i> your servant and your son. Come up and save me from the hand of the king of Syria and from the hand of the king of Israel, who rise up against me.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and in the treasuries of the king&#8217;s house, and sent <i>it as</i> a present to the king of Assyria. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So the king of Assyria heeded him; for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus and took it, carried <i>its people</i> captive to Kir, and killed Rezin.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Now King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria, and saw an altar that <i>was</i> at Damascus; and King Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the design of the altar and its pattern, according to all its workmanship. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that King Ahaz had sent from Damascus. So Urijah the priest made <i>it</i> before King Ahaz came back from Damascus. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And when the king came back from Damascus, the king saw the altar; and the king approached the altar and made offerings on it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So he burned his burnt offering and his grain offering; and he poured his drink offering and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings on the altar. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>He also brought the bronze altar which <i>was</i> before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, from the front of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>temple&#8212;from between the <i>new</i> altar and the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8212;and put it on the north side of the <i>new</i> altar. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then King Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, &#8220;On the great <i>new</i> altar burn the morning burnt offering, the evening grain offering, the king&#8217;s burnt sacrifice, and his grain offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, their grain offering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle on it all the blood of the burnt offering and all the blood of the sacrifice. And the bronze altar shall be for me to inquire <i>by.</i>&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that King Ahaz commanded.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And King Ahaz cut off the panels of the carts, and removed the lavers from them; and he took down the Sea from the bronze oxen that <i>were</i> under it, and put it on a pavement of stones. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Also he removed the Sabbath pavilion which they had built in the temple, and he removed the king&#8217;s outer entrance from the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, on account of the king of Assyria.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So Ahaz rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of David. Then Hezekiah his son reigned in his place.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-9970a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Kings 16:6">2 Kings 16:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Large Tree;</i> sing. of <i>Eloth</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9970b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Kings 16:6">2 Kings 16:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'>A few ancient mss. <i>Syrians</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9971c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Kings 16:7">2 Kings 16:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'>A later name of <i>Pul,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Kgs.15.19" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Kgs.15.19&amp;version=NKJV">2 Kin. 15:19</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9978d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Kings 16:14">2 Kings 16:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>house</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
