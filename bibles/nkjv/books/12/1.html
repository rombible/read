<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Now Ahaziah fell through the lattice of his upper room in Samaria, and was injured; so he sent messengers and said to them, &#8220;Go, inquire of Baal-Zebub,<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span> the god of Ekron, whether I shall recover from this injury.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Elijah the Tishbite, &#8220;Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say to them, &#8216;<i>Is it</i> because <i>there is</i> no God in Israel <i>that</i> you are going to inquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron?&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Now therefore, thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8216;You shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up, but you shall surely die.&#8217; &#8221; So Elijah departed.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And when the messengers returned to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>him, he said to them, &#8220;Why have you come back?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So they said to him, &#8220;A man came up to meet us, and said to us, &#8216;Go, return to the king who sent you, and say to him, &#8220;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8216;<i>Is it</i> because <i>there is</i> no God in Israel <i>that</i> you are sending to inquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up, but you shall surely die.&#8217; &#8221; &#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then he said to them, &#8220;What kind of man <i>was it</i> who came up to meet you and told you these words?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So they answered him, &#8220;A hairy man wearing a leather belt around his waist.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-1-8">And he said, &#8220;It <i>is</i> Elijah the Tishbite.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then the king sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty men. So he went up to him; and there he was, sitting on the top of a hill. And he spoke to him: &#8220;Man of God, the king has said, &#8216;Come down!&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, &#8220;If I <i>am</i> a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men.&#8221; And fire came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then he sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty men.</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-1-11">And he answered and said to him: &#8220;Man of God, thus has the king said, &#8216;Come down quickly!&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So Elijah answered and said to them, &#8220;If I <i>am</i> a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men.&#8221; And the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Again, he sent a third captain of fifty with his fifty men. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>fell on his knees before Elijah, and pleaded with him, and said to him: &#8220;Man of God, please let my life and the life of these fifty servants of yours be precious in your sight. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Look, fire has come down from heaven and burned up the first two captains of fifties with their fifties. But let my life now be precious in your sight.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Elijah, &#8220;Go down with him; do not be afraid of him.&#8221; So he arose and went down with him to the king. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then he said to him, &#8220;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8216;Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron, <i>is it</i> because <i>there is</i> no God in Israel to inquire of His word? Therefore you shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up, but you shall surely die.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So <i>Ahaziah</i> died according to the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> which Elijah had spoken. Because he had no son, Jehoram<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span> became king in his place, in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-9536a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Kings 1:2">2 Kings 1:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Lord of Flies</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9537b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Kings 1:3">2 Kings 1:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>Angel</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9539c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Kings 1:5">2 Kings 1:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Ahaziah</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9547d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Kings 1:13">2 Kings 1:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>bowed down</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9549e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Kings 1:15">2 Kings 1:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>Angel</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9551f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Kings 1:17">2 Kings 1:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'>The son of Ahab king of Israel, <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Kgs.3.1" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Kgs.3.1&amp;version=NKJV">2 Kin. 3:1</span></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
