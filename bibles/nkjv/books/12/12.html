His mother&#8217;s name <i>was</i> Zibiah of Beersheba. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Jehoash did <i>what was</i> right in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> all the days in which Jehoiada the priest instructed him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And Jehoash said to the priests, &#8220;All the money of the dedicated gifts that are brought into the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8212;each man&#8217;s census<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> money, each man&#8217;s assessment money&#8212;<i>and</i> all the money that <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>a man purposes in his heart to bring into the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>let the priests take <i>it</i> themselves, each from his constituency; and let them repair the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>damages of the temple, wherever any dilapidation is found.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now it was so, by the twenty-third year of King Jehoash, <i>that</i> the priests had not repaired the damages of the temple. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So King Jehoash called Jehoiada the priest and the <i>other</i> priests, and said to them, &#8220;Why have you not repaired the damages of the temple? Now therefore, do not take <i>more</i> money from your constituency, but deliver it for repairing the damages of the temple.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And the priests agreed that they would neither receive <i>more</i> money from the people, nor repair the damages of the temple.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then Jehoiada the priest took a chest, bored a hole in its lid, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one comes into the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; and the priests who <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>kept the door put there all the money brought into the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So it was, whenever they saw that <i>there was</i> much money in the chest, that the king&#8217;s scribe<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span> and the high priest came up and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>put it in bags, and counted the money that was found in the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then they gave the money, which had been apportioned, into the hands of those who did the work, who had the oversight of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; and they <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>paid it out to the carpenters and builders who worked on the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>and to masons and stonecutters, and for buying timber and hewn stone, to repair the damage of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and for all that was paid out to repair the temple. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>However there were not made for the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> basins of silver, trimmers, sprinkling-bowls, trumpets, any articles of gold or articles of silver, from the money brought into the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But they gave that to the workmen, and they repaired the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> with it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Moreover they did not require an account from the men into whose hand they delivered the money to be paid to workmen, for they dealt faithfully. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>The money from the trespass offerings and the money from the sin offerings was not brought into the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. It belonged to the priests.</span></p> <h3>
Hazael Threatens Jerusalem</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Kgs-12-17"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Hazael king of Syria went up and fought against Gath, and took it; then Hazael set his face to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>go up to Jerusalem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And Jehoash king of Judah took all the sacred things that his fathers, Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own sacred things, and all the gold found in the treasuries of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and in the king&#8217;s house, and sent <i>them</i> to Hazael king of Syria. Then he went away from Jerusalem.</span></p> <h3>
Death of Joash</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Kgs-12-19"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Now the rest of the acts of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span>Joash, and all that he did, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And his servants arose and formed a conspiracy, and killed Joash in the house of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[l]</a></span>the Millo, which goes down to Silla. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/12-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>For <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[m]</a></span>Jozachar the son of Shimeath and Jehozabad the son of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[n]</a></span>Shomer, his servants, struck him. So he died, and they buried him with his fathers in the City of David.
