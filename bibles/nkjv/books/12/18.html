<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother&#8217;s name <i>was</i> Abi<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span> the daughter of Zechariah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And he did <i>what was</i> right in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, according to all that his father David had done.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>He removed the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>high places and broke the <i>sacred</i> pillars, cut down the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>wooden image and broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made; for until those days the children of Israel burned incense to it, and called it <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>Nehushtan. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>He trusted in the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel, so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor who were before him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>For he held fast to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; he did not depart from following Him, but kept His commandments, which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had commanded Moses. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was with him; he prospered wherever he went. And he rebelled against the king of Assyria and did not serve him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>He <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>subdued the Philistines, as far as Gaza and its territory, from watchtower to fortified city.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Now it came to pass in the fourth year of King Hezekiah, which <i>was</i> the seventh year of Hoshea the son of Elah, king of Israel, <i>that</i> Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria and besieged it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And at the end of three years they took it. In the sixth year of Hezekiah, that <i>is,</i> the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then the king of Assyria carried Israel away captive to Assyria, and put them in Halah and by the Habor, the River of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>because they did not obey the voice of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> their God, but transgressed His covenant <i>and</i> all that Moses the servant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had commanded; and they would neither hear nor do <i>them.</i></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and took them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria at Lachish, saying, &#8220;I have done wrong; turn away from me; whatever you impose on me I will pay.&#8221; And the king of Assyria assessed Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So Hezekiah gave <i>him</i> all the silver that was found in the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and in the treasuries of the king&#8217;s house. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>At that time Hezekiah stripped <i>the gold from</i> the doors of the temple of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and <i>from</i> the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>it to the king of Assyria.</span></p> <h3>
Sennacherib Boasts Against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span></span></h3><p><span class="text 2Kgs-18-17"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then the king of Assyria sent <i>the</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>Tartan, <i>the</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>Rabsaris, <i>and the</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>Rabshakeh from Lachish, with a great army against Jerusalem, to King Hezekiah. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. When they had come up, they went and stood by the aqueduct from the upper pool, which <i>was</i> on the highway to the Fuller&#8217;s Field. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And when they had called to the king, Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who <i>was</i> over the household, Shebna the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came out to them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then <i>the</i> Rabshakeh said to them, &#8220;Say now to Hezekiah, &#8216;Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria: &#8220;What confidence <i>is</i> this in which you trust? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>You speak of <i>having</i> plans and power for war; but <i>they are</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span>mere words. And in whom do you trust, that you rebel against me? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Now look! You are trusting in the staff of this broken reed, Egypt, on which if a man leans, it will go into his hand and pierce it. So <i>is</i> Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But if you say to me, &#8216;We trust in the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God,&#8217; <i>is</i> it not He whose <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[l]</a></span>high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and said to Judah and Jerusalem, &#8216;You shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem&#8217;?&#8221; &#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Now therefore, I urge you, give a pledge to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses&#8212;if you are able on your part to put riders on them! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>How then will you repel one captain of the least of my master&#8217;s servants, and put your trust in Egypt for chariots and horsemen? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Have I now come up without the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> against this place to destroy it?

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, Shebna, and Joah said to <i>the</i> Rabshakeh, &#8220;Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand <i>it;</i> and do not speak to us in <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[m]</a></span>Hebrew in the hearing of the people who <i>are</i> on the wall.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>But <i>the</i> Rabshakeh said to them, &#8220;Has my master sent me to your master and to you to speak these words, and not to the men who sit on the wall, who will eat and drink their own waste with you?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then <i>the</i> Rabshakeh stood and called out with a loud voice in <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[n]</a></span>Hebrew, and spoke, saying, &#8220;Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Thus says the king: &#8216;Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he shall not be able to deliver you from his hand; </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Do not listen to Hezekiah; for thus says the king of Assyria: &#8216;Make <i>peace</i> with me <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[o]</a></span>by a present and come out to me; and every one of you eat from his own vine and every one from his own fig tree, and every one of you drink the waters of his own cistern; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive groves and honey, that you may live and not die.
