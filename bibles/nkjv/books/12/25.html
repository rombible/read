<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So the city was besieged until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>By the ninth <i>day</i> of the <i>fourth</i> month the famine had become so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then the city wall was broken through, and all the men of war <i>fled</i> at night by way of the gate between two walls, which was by the king&#8217;s garden, even though the Chaldeans <i>were</i> still encamped all around against the city. And <i>the king</i><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span> went by way of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>plain. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king, and they overtook him in the plains of Jericho. All his army was scattered from him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So they took the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah, and they pronounced judgment on him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then they killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, put<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> out the eyes of Zedekiah, bound him with bronze fetters, and took him to Babylon.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And in the fifth month, on the seventh <i>day</i> of the month (which <i>was</i> the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon), Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>He burned the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and the king&#8217;s house; all the houses of Jerusalem, that is, all the houses of the great, he burned with fire. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And all the army of the Chaldeans who <i>were with</i> the captain of the guard broke down the walls of Jerusalem all around.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive the rest of the people <i>who</i> remained in the city and the defectors who had deserted to the king of Babylon, with the rest of the multitude. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But the captain of the guard left <i>some</i> of the poor of the land as vinedressers and farmers. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>The bronze pillars that <i>were</i> in the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and the carts and the bronze Sea that <i>were</i> in the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, the Chaldeans broke in pieces, and carried their bronze to Babylon. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>They also took away the pots, the shovels, the trimmers, the spoons, and all the bronze utensils with which the priests ministered. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>The firepans and the basins, the things of solid gold and solid silver, the captain of the guard took away. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>The two pillars, one Sea, and the carts, which Solomon had made for the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, the bronze of all these articles was beyond measure. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>The height of one pillar <i>was</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>eighteen cubits, and the capital on it <i>was</i> of bronze. The height of the capital was three cubits, and the network and pomegranates all around the capital were all of bronze. The second pillar was the same, with a network.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the second priest, and the three doorkeepers. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>He also took out of the city an officer who had charge of the men of war, five men of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>the king&#8217;s close associates who were found in the city, the chief recruiting officer of the army, who mustered the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of the land <i>who were</i> found in the city. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, took these and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then the king of Babylon struck them and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive from its own land.</span></p> <h3>
Gedaliah Made Governor of Judah</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Kgs-25-22"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, governor over the people who remained in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Now when all the captains of the armies, they and <i>their</i> men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah&#8212;Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, Johanan the son of Careah, Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And Gedaliah took an oath before them and their men, and said to them, &#8220;Do not be afraid of the servants of the Chaldeans. Dwell in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>But it happened in the seventh month that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal family, came with ten men and struck and killed Gedaliah, the Jews, as well as the Chaldeans who were with him at Mizpah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And all the people, small and great, and the captains of the armies, arose and went to Egypt; for they were afraid of the Chaldeans.</span></p> <h3>
Jehoiachin Released from Prison</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Kgs-25-27"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Now it came to pass in the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-seventh <i>day</i> of the month, <i>that</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>Evil-Merodach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, released Jehoiachin king of Judah from prison. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>He spoke kindly to him, and gave him a more prominent seat than those of the kings who <i>were</i> with him in Babylon. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>So Jehoiachin changed from his prison garments, and he ate <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>bread regularly before the king all the days of his life. </span>
