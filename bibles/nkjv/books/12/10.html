And Jehu wrote and sent letters to Samaria, to the rulers of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>Jezreel, to the elders, and to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>those who reared Ahab&#8217;s <i>sons,</i> saying:</span></p> <div class="left-1 top-1"><p class="first-line-none">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Now as soon as this letter comes to you, since your master&#8217;s sons <i>are</i> with you, and you have chariots and horses, a fortified city also, and weapons, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>choose the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>best qualified of your master&#8217;s sons, set <i>him</i> on his father&#8217;s throne, and fight for your master&#8217;s house.</span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, &#8220;Look, two kings could not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>stand up to him; how then can we stand?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And he who <i>was</i> in charge of the house, and he who <i>was</i> in charge of the city, the elders also, and those who reared <i>the sons,</i> sent to Jehu, saying, &#8220;We <i>are</i> your servants, we will do all you tell us; but we will not make anyone king. Do <i>what is</i> good in your sight.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then he wrote a second letter to them, saying:</span></p><div class="left-1 top-1"><p class="first-line-none"><span class="text 2Kgs-10-6">If you <i>are</i> for me and will obey my voice, take the heads of the men, your master&#8217;s sons, and come to me at Jezreel by this time tomorrow.</span></p></div><p class="top-1"><span class="text 2Kgs-10-6">Now the king&#8217;s sons, seventy persons, <i>were</i> with the great men of the city, <i>who</i> were rearing them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So it was, when the letter came to them, that they took the king&#8217;s sons and slaughtered seventy persons, put their heads in baskets and sent <i>them</i> to him at Jezreel.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then a messenger came and told him, saying, &#8220;They have brought the heads of the king&#8217;s sons.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-10-8">And he said, &#8220;Lay them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until morning.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So it was, in the morning, that he went out and stood, and said to all the people, &#8220;You <i>are</i> righteous. Indeed I conspired against my master and killed him; but who killed all these? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Know now that nothing shall fall to the earth of the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> spoke concerning the house of Ahab; for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has done what He spoke by His servant Elijah.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So Jehu killed all who remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men and his close acquaintances and his priests, until he left him none remaining.</span></p> <h3>
Ahaziah&#8217;s Forty-two Brothers Killed</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Kgs-10-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And he arose and departed and went to Samaria. On the way, at <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>Beth Eked of the Shepherds, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Jehu met with the brothers of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, &#8220;Who <i>are</i> you?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-10-13">So they answered, &#8220;We <i>are</i> the brothers of Ahaziah; we have come down to greet the sons of the king and the sons of the queen mother.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;Take them alive!&#8221; So they took them alive, and killed them at the well of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>Beth Eked, forty-two men; and he left none of them.</span></p> <h3>
The Rest of Ahab&#8217;s Family Killed</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Kgs-10-15"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Now when he departed from there, he <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>met Jehonadab the son of Rechab, <i>coming</i> to meet him; and he greeted him and said to him, &#8220;Is your heart right, as my heart <i>is</i> toward your heart?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-10-15">And Jehonadab answered, &#8220;It is.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-10-15"><i>Jehu said,</i> &#8220;If it is, give <i>me</i> your hand.&#8221; So he gave <i>him</i> his hand, and he took him up to him into the chariot. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then he said, &#8220;Come with me, and see my zeal for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221; So they had him ride in his chariot. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And when he came to Samaria, he killed all who remained to Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed them, according to the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> which He spoke to Elijah.</span></p> <h3>
Worshipers of Baal Killed</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Kgs-10-18"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then Jehu gathered all the people together, and said to them, &#8220;Ahab served Baal a little, Jehu will serve him much. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Now therefore, call to me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests. Let no one be missing, for I have a great sacrifice for Baal. Whoever is missing shall not live.&#8221; But Jehu acted deceptively, with the intent of destroying the worshipers of Baal. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And Jehu said, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>&#8220;Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal.&#8221; So they proclaimed <i>it.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then Jehu sent throughout all Israel; and all the worshipers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left who did not come. So they came into the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>temple of Baal, and the temple of Baal was full from one end to the other. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And he said to the one in charge of the wardrobe, &#8220;Bring out vestments for all the worshipers of Baal.&#8221; So he brought out vestments for them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Then Jehu and Jehonadab the son of Rechab went into the temple of Baal, and said to the worshipers of Baal, &#8220;Search and see that no servants of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> are here with you, but only the worshipers of Baal.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>So they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had appointed for himself eighty men on the outside, and had said, &#8220;<i>If</i> any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escapes, <i>whoever lets him escape, it shall be</i> his life for the life of the other.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Now it happened, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, &#8220;Go in <i>and</i> kill them; let no one come out!&#8221; And they killed them with the edge of the sword; then the guards and the officers threw <i>them</i> out, and went into the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>inner room of the temple of Baal. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And they brought the <i>sacred</i> pillars out of the temple of Baal and burned them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Then they broke down the <i>sacred</i> pillar of Baal, and tore down the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span>temple of Baal and made it a refuse dump to this day. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Thus Jehu destroyed Baal from Israel.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>However Jehu did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin, <i>that is,</i> from the golden calves that <i>were</i> at Bethel and Dan. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Jehu, &#8220;Because you have done well in doing <i>what is</i> right in My sight, <i>and</i> have done to the house of Ahab all that <i>was</i> in My heart, your sons shall sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth <i>generation.</i>&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>But Jehu <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[l]</a></span>took no heed to walk in the law of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel with all his heart; for he did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam, who had made Israel sin.</span></p> <h3>
Death of Jehu</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Kgs-10-32"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>In those days the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> began to cut off <i>parts</i> of Israel; and Hazael conquered them in all the territory of Israel </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>from the Jordan eastward: all the land of Gilead&#8212;Gad, Reuben, and Manasseh&#8212;from Aroer, which <i>is</i> by the River Arnon, including Gilead and Bashan.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, all that he did, and all his might, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>So Jehu <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[m]</a></span>rested with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria. Then Jehoahaz his son reigned in his place. </span>
