<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he did evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, but not as the kings of Israel who were before him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against him; and Hoshea became his vassal, and paid him tribute money. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And the king of Assyria uncovered a conspiracy by Hoshea; for he had sent messengers to So, king of Egypt, and brought no tribute to the king of Assyria, as <i>he had done</i> year by year. Therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.</span></p> <h3>
Israel Carried Captive to Assyria</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Kgs-17-5"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now the king of Assyria went throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria and besieged it for three years. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria took Samaria and carried Israel away to Assyria, and placed them in Halah and by the Habor, the River of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For so it was that the children of Israel had sinned against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> their God, who had brought them up out of the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and they had feared other gods, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>and had walked in the statutes of the nations whom the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they had made. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Also the children of Israel secretly did against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> their God things that <i>were</i> not right, and they built for themselves <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>high places in all their cities, from watchtower to fortified city. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>They set up for themselves <i>sacred</i> pillars and wooden images<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span> on every high hill and under every green tree. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>There they burned incense on all the high places, like the nations whom the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had carried away before them; and they did wicked things to provoke the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> to anger, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>for they served idols, of which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had said to them, &#8220;You shall not do this thing.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Yet the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> testified against Israel and against Judah, by all of His prophets, every seer, saying, &#8220;Turn from your evil ways, and keep My commandments <i>and</i> My statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by My servants the prophets.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Nevertheless they would not hear, but stiffened their necks, like the necks of their fathers, who did not believe in the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> their God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And they rejected His statutes and His covenant that He had made with their fathers, and His testimonies which He had testified against them; they followed idols, became idolaters, and <i>went</i> after the nations who <i>were</i> all around them, <i>concerning</i> whom the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had charged them that they should not do like them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So they left all the commandments of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> their God, made for themselves a molded image <i>and</i> two calves, made a wooden image and worshiped all the host of heaven, and served Baal. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And they caused their sons and daughters to pass through the fire, practiced witchcraft and soothsaying, and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, to provoke Him to anger. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Therefore the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was very angry with Israel, and removed them from His sight; there was none left but the tribe of Judah alone.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Also Judah did not keep the commandments of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> rejected all the descendants of Israel, afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of plunderers, until He had cast them from His sight. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>For He tore Israel from the house of David, and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king. Then Jeroboam drove Israel from following the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and made them commit a great sin. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they did not depart from them, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>until the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> removed Israel out of His sight, as He had said by all His servants the prophets. So Israel was carried away from their own land to Assyria, <i>as it is</i> to this day.</span></p> <h3>
Assyria Resettles Samaria</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Kgs-17-24"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then the king of Assyria brought <i>people</i> from Babylon, Cuthah, Ava, Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed <i>them</i> in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel; and they took possession of Samaria and dwelt in its cities. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And it was so, at the beginning of their dwelling there, <i>that</i> they did not fear the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; therefore the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> sent lions among them, which killed <i>some</i> of them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>So they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, &#8220;The nations whom you have removed and placed in the cities of Samaria do not know the rituals of the God of the land; therefore He has sent lions among them, and indeed, they are killing them because they do not know the rituals of the God of the land.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, &#8220;Send there one of the priests whom you brought from there; let him go and dwell there, and let him teach them the rituals of the God of the land.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>However every nation continued to make gods of its own, and put <i>them</i> in the shrines on the high places which the Samaritans had made, <i>every</i> nation in the cities where they dwelt. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>The men of Babylon made Succoth Benoth, the men of Cuth made Nergal, the men of Hamath made Ashima, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>and the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak; and the Sepharvites burned their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>So they feared the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and from every class they appointed for themselves priests of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>high places, who sacrificed for them in the shrines of the high places. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>They feared the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, yet served their own gods&#8212;according to the rituals of the nations from among whom they were carried away.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>To this day they continue practicing the former rituals; they do not fear the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, nor do they follow their statutes or their ordinances, or the law and commandment which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had commanded the children of Jacob, whom He named Israel, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>with whom the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had made a covenant and charged them, saying: &#8220;You shall not fear other gods, nor bow down to them nor serve them nor sacrifice to them; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>but the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, who brought you up from the land of Egypt with great power and an outstretched arm, Him you shall fear, Him you shall worship, and to Him you shall offer sacrifice. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>And the statutes, the ordinances, the law, and the commandment which He wrote for you, you shall be careful to observe forever; you shall not fear other gods. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>And the covenant that I have made with you, you shall not forget, nor shall you fear other gods. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>But the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God you shall fear; and He will deliver you from the hand of all your enemies.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>However they did not obey, but they followed their former rituals. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>So these nations feared the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, yet served their carved images; also their children and their children&#8217;s children have continued doing as their fathers did, even to this day.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-9993a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Kings 17:9">2 Kings 17:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Places for pagan worship</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9994b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Kings 17:10">2 Kings 17:10</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. <i>Asherim,</i> Canaanite deities</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-10016c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Kings 17:32">2 Kings 17:32</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Places for pagan worship</span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
