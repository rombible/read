<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then Elijah said to Elisha, &#8220;Stay here, please, for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has sent me on to Bethel.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-2-2">But Elisha said, &#8220;<i>As</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> lives, and <i>as</i> your soul lives, I will not leave you!&#8221; So they went down to Bethel.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Now the sons of the prophets who <i>were</i> at Bethel came out to Elisha, and said to him, &#8220;Do you know that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will take away your master <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>from over you today?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-2-3">And he said, &#8220;Yes, I know; keep silent!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then Elijah said to him, &#8220;Elisha, stay here, please, for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has sent me on to Jericho.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-2-4">But he said, &#8220;<i>As</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> lives, and <i>as</i> your soul lives, I will not leave you!&#8221; So they came to Jericho.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now the sons of the prophets who <i>were</i> at Jericho came to Elisha and said to him, &#8220;Do you know that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will take away your master from over you today?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-2-5">So he answered, &#8220;Yes, I know; keep silent!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then Elijah said to him, &#8220;Stay here, please, for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has sent me on to the Jordan.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-2-6">But he said, &#8220;<i>As</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> lives, and <i>as</i> your soul lives, I will not leave you!&#8221; So the two of them went on. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood facing <i>them</i> at a distance, while the two of them stood by the Jordan. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Now Elijah took his mantle, rolled <i>it</i> up, and struck the water; and it was divided this way and that, so that the two of them crossed over on dry ground.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And so it was, when they had crossed over, that Elijah said to Elisha, &#8220;Ask! What may I do for you, before I am taken away from you?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-2-9">Elisha said, &#8220;Please let a double portion of your spirit be upon me.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So he said, &#8220;You have asked a hard thing. <i>Nevertheless,</i> if you see me <i>when I am</i> taken from you, it shall be so for you; but if not, it shall not be <i>so.</i>&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then it happened, as they continued on and talked, that suddenly a chariot of fire <i>appeared</i> with horses of fire, and separated the two of them; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And Elisha saw <i>it,</i> and he cried out, &#8220;My father, my father, the chariot of Israel and its horsemen!&#8221; So he saw him no more. And he took hold of his own clothes and tore them into two pieces. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>He also took up the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and went back and stood by the bank of the Jordan. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then he took the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and struck the water, and said, &#8220;Where <i>is</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Elijah?&#8221; And when he also had struck the water, it was divided this way and that; and Elisha crossed over.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Now when the sons of the prophets who <i>were</i> from<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span> Jericho saw him, they said, &#8220;The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.&#8221; And they came to meet him, and bowed to the ground before him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then they said to him, &#8220;Look now, there are fifty strong men with your servants. Please let them go and search for your master, lest perhaps the Spirit of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has taken him up and cast him upon some mountain or into some valley.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-2-16">And he said, &#8220;You shall not send anyone.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, &#8220;Send <i>them!</i>&#8221; Therefore they sent fifty men, and they searched for three days but did not find him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And when they came back to him, for he had stayed in Jericho, he said to them, &#8220;Did I not say to you, &#8216;Do not go&#8217;?&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Elisha Performs Miracles</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Kgs-2-19"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then the men of the city said to Elisha, &#8220;Please notice, the situation of this city <i>is</i> pleasant, as my lord sees; but the water <i>is</i> bad, and the ground barren.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;Bring me a new bowl, and put salt in it.&#8221; So they brought <i>it</i> to him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then he went out to the source of the water, and cast in the salt there, and said, &#8220;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8216;I have <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>healed this water; from it there shall be no more death or barrenness.&#8217; &#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So the water remains healed to this day, according to the word of Elisha which he spoke.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Then he went up from there to Bethel; and as he was going up the road, some youths came from the city and mocked him, and said to him, &#8220;Go up, you baldhead! Go up, you baldhead!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>So he turned around and looked at them, and pronounced a curse on them in the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. And two female bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the youths.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then he went from there to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-9555a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Kings 2:3">2 Kings 2:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>from your head</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9567b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Kings 2:15">2 Kings 2:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>at Jericho opposite him saw</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9573c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Kings 2:21">2 Kings 2:21</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>purified</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
