His mother&#8217;s name <i>was</i> Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he did <i>what was</i> right in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and walked in all the ways of his father David; he did not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.</span></p> <h3>
Hilkiah Finds the Book of the Law</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Kgs-22-3"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Now it came to pass, in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, <i>that</i> the king sent Shaphan the scribe, the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, to the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, saying: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8220;Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may count the money which has been brought into the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, which the doorkeepers have gathered from the people. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And let them deliver it into the hand of those doing the work, who are the overseers in the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; let them give it to those who <i>are</i> in the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> doing the work, to repair the damages of the house&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>to carpenters and builders and masons&#8212;and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>However there need be no accounting made with them of the money delivered into their hand, because they deal faithfully.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, &#8220;I have found the Book of the Law in the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221; And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So Shaphan the scribe went to the king, bringing the king word, saying, &#8220;Your servants have <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>gathered the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of those who do the work, who oversee the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then Shaphan the scribe showed the king, saying, &#8220;Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.&#8221; And Shaphan read it before the king.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now it happened, when the king heard the words of the Book of the Law, that he tore his clothes. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>Achbor the son of Michaiah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8220;Go, inquire of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> for me, for the people and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found; for great <i>is</i> the wrath of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> that is aroused against us, because our fathers have not obeyed the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Achbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe. (She dwelt in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter.) And they spoke with her. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then she said to them, &#8220;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel, &#8216;Tell the man who sent you to Me, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>&#8220;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8216;Behold, I will bring calamity on this place and on its inhabitants&#8212;all the words of the book which the king of Judah has read&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>because they have forsaken Me and burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke Me to anger with all the works of their hands. Therefore My wrath shall be aroused against this place and shall not be quenched.&#8217; &#8221; &#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>But as for the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, in this manner you shall speak to him, &#8216;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel: &#8220;<i>Concerning</i> the words which you have heard&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>because your heart was tender, and you humbled yourself before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> when you heard what I spoke against this place and against its inhabitants, that they would become a desolation and a curse, and you tore your clothes and wept before Me, I also have heard <i>you,</i>&#8221; says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>&#8220;Surely, therefore, I will <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>gather you to your fathers, and you shall <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>be gathered to your grave in peace; and your eyes shall not see all the calamity which I will bring on this place.&#8221; &#8217; &#8221; So they brought back word to the king.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-10155a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Kings 22:9">2 Kings 22:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>poured out</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-10158b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Kings 22:12">2 Kings 22:12</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Abdon the son of Micah,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Chr.34.20" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Chr.34.20&amp;version=NKJV">2 Chr. 34:20</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-10166c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Kings 22:20">2 Kings 22:20</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Cause you to join your ancestors in death</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-10166d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Kings 22:20">2 Kings 22:20</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Die a natural death</span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
