<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Now when you arrive at that place, look there for Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, and go in and make him rise up from among his associates, and take him to an inner room. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then take the flask of oil, and pour <i>it</i> on his head, and say, &#8216;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8220;I have anointed you king over Israel.&#8221; &#8217; Then open the door and flee, and do not delay.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So the young man, the servant of the prophet, went to Ramoth Gilead. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And when he arrived, there <i>were</i> the captains of the army sitting; and he said, &#8220;I have a message for you, Commander.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-9-5">Jehu said, &#8220;For which <i>one</i> of us?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-9-5">And he said, &#8220;For you, Commander.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then he arose and went into the house. And he poured the oil on his head, and said to him, &#8220;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel: &#8216;I have anointed you king over the people of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, over Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>You shall strike down the house of Ahab your master, that I may avenge the blood of My servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, at the hand of Jezebel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For the whole house of Ahab shall perish; and I will cut off from Ahab all the males in Israel, both bond and free. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>The dogs shall eat Jezebel on the plot <i>of ground</i> at Jezreel, and <i>there shall be</i> none to bury <i>her.</i>&#8217; &#8221; And he opened the door and fled.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then Jehu came out to the servants of his master, and <i>one</i> said to him, &#8220;<i>Is</i> all well? Why did this madman come to you?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-9-11">And he said to them, &#8220;You know the man and his babble.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And they said, &#8220;A lie! Tell us now.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-9-12">So he said, &#8220;Thus and thus he spoke to me, saying, &#8216;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8220;I have anointed you king over Israel.&#8221; &#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then each man hastened to take his garment and put <i>it</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>under him on the top of the steps; and they blew trumpets, saying, &#8220;Jehu is king!&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Joram of Israel Killed</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Kgs-9-14"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, conspired against Joram. (Now Joram had been defending Ramoth Gilead, he and all Israel, against Hazael king of Syria. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But King <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Joram had returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds which the Syrians had inflicted on him when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, &#8220;If you are so minded, let no one leave <i>or</i> escape from the city to go and tell <i>it</i> in Jezreel.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So Jehu rode in a chariot and went to Jezreel, for Joram was laid up there; and Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to see Joram.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Now a watchman stood on the tower in Jezreel, and he saw the company of Jehu as he came, and said, &#8220;I see a company of men.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-9-17">And Joram said, &#8220;Get a horseman and send him to meet them, and let him say, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>&#8216;<i>Is it</i> peace?&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>So the horseman went to meet him, and said, &#8220;Thus says the king: &#8216;<i>Is it</i> peace?&#8217; &#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-9-18">And Jehu said, &#8220;What have you to do with peace? <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>Turn around and follow me.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-9-18">So the watchman reported, saying, &#8220;The messenger went to them, but is not coming back.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then he sent out a second horseman who came to them, and said, &#8220;Thus says the king: &#8216;<i>Is it</i> peace?&#8217; &#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-9-19">And Jehu answered, &#8220;What have you to do with peace? Turn around and follow me.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So the watchman reported, saying, &#8220;He went up to them and is not coming back; and the driving <i>is</i> like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi, for he drives furiously!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then Joram said, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>&#8220;Make ready.&#8221; And his chariot was made ready. Then Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot; and they went out to meet Jehu, and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>met him on the property of Naboth the Jezreelite. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Now it happened, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, &#8220;<i>Is it</i> peace, Jehu?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-9-22">So he answered, &#8220;What peace, as long as the harlotries of your mother Jezebel and her witchcraft <i>are so</i> many?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Then Joram turned around and fled, and said to Ahaziah, &#8220;Treachery, Ahaziah!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Now Jehu <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>drew his bow with full strength and shot Jehoram between his arms; and the arrow came out at his heart, and he sank down in his chariot. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then <i>Jehu</i> said to Bidkar his captain, &#8220;Pick <i>him</i> up, <i>and</i> throw him into the tract of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite; for remember, when you and I were riding together behind Ahab his father, that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> laid this burden upon him: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>&#8216;Surely I saw yesterday the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons,&#8217; says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, &#8216;and I will repay you <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>in this plot,&#8217; says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. Now therefore, take <i>and</i> throw him on the plot <i>of ground,</i> according to the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Ahaziah of Judah Killed</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Kgs-9-27"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>But when Ahaziah king of Judah saw <i>this,</i> he fled by the road to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>Beth Haggan. So Jehu pursued him, and said, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span>&#8220;Shoot him also in the chariot.&#8221; <i>And they shot him</i> at the Ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. Then he fled to Megiddo, and died there. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And his servants carried him in the chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his tomb with his fathers in the City of David. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>In the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab, Ahaziah had become king over Judah.</span></p> <h3>
Jezebel&#8217;s Violent Death</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Kgs-9-30"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Now when Jehu had come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard <i>of it;</i> and she put paint on her eyes and adorned her head, and looked through a window. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Then, as Jehu entered at the gate, she said, &#8220;<i>Is it</i> peace, Zimri, murderer of your master?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And he looked up at the window, and said, &#8220;Who <i>is</i> on my side? Who?&#8221; So two <i>or</i> three eunuchs looked out at him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Then he said, &#8220;Throw her down.&#8221; So they threw her down, and <i>some</i> of her blood spattered on the wall and on the horses; and he trampled her underfoot. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>And when he had gone in, he ate and drank. Then he said, &#8220;Go now, see to this accursed <i>woman,</i> and bury her, for she was a king&#8217;s daughter.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>So they went to bury her, but they found no more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of <i>her</i> hands. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Therefore they came back and told him. And he said, &#8220;This <i>is</i> the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, which He spoke by His servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, &#8216;On the plot <i>of ground</i> at Jezreel dogs shall eat the flesh of Jezebel; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>and the corpse of Jezebel shall be as refuse on the surface of the field, in the plot at Jezreel, so that they shall not say, &#8220;Here <i>lies</i> Jezebel.&#8221; &#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-9758a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Kings 9:1">2 Kings 9:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Gird up your loins</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9770b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Kings 9:13">2 Kings 9:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>under his feet</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9772c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Kings 9:15">2 Kings 9:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Jehoram,</i> v. <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Kgs.9.24" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Kgs.9.24&amp;version=NKJV">24</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9774d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Kings 9:17">2 Kings 9:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Are you peaceful?</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9775e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Kings 9:18">2 Kings 9:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Turn behind me</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9778f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Kings 9:21">2 Kings 9:21</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Harness up</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9778g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Kings 9:21">2 Kings 9:21</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>found</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9781h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Kings 9:24">2 Kings 9:24</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>filled his hand</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9783i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Kings 9:26">2 Kings 9:26</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>on this property</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9784j"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Kings 9:27">2 Kings 9:27</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>The Garden House</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9784k"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Kings 9:27">2 Kings 9:27</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Strike</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
