<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he did evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, but not like his father and mother; for he put away the <i>sacred</i> pillar of Baal that his father had made. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Nevertheless he persisted in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin; he did not depart from them.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheepbreeder, and he regularly paid the king of Israel one hundred thousand lambs and the wool of one hundred thousand rams. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But it happened, when Ahab died, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So King Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time and mustered all Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then he went and sent to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, saying, &#8220;The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me to fight against Moab?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-3-7">And he said, &#8220;I will go up; I <i>am</i> as you <i>are,</i> my people as your people, my horses as your horses.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then he said, &#8220;Which way shall we go up?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-3-8">And he answered, &#8220;By way of the Wilderness of Edom.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom, and they marched on that roundabout route seven days; and there was no water for the army, nor for the animals that followed them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And the king of Israel said, &#8220;Alas! For the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But Jehoshaphat said, &#8220;<i>Is there</i> no prophet of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> here, that we may inquire of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> by him?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-3-11">So one of the servants of the king of Israel answered and said, &#8220;Elisha the son of Shaphat <i>is</i> here, who poured<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span> water on the hands of Elijah.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And Jehoshaphat said, &#8220;The word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> is with him.&#8221; So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then Elisha said to the king of Israel, &#8220;What have I to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father and the prophets of your mother.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-3-13">But the king of Israel said to him, &#8220;No, for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has called these three kings <i>together</i> to deliver them into the hand of Moab.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And Elisha said, &#8220;<i>As</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts lives, before whom I stand, surely were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, I would not look at you, nor see you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But now bring me a musician.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-3-15">Then it happened, when the musician played, that the hand of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came upon him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8216;Make this valley full of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>ditches.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>For thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8216;You shall not see wind, nor shall you see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, so that you, your cattle, and your animals may drink.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And this is a simple matter in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; He will also deliver the Moabites into your hand. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Also you shall attack every fortified city and every choice city, and shall cut down every good tree, and stop up every spring of water, and ruin every good piece of land with stones.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Now it happened in the morning, when the grain offering was offered, that suddenly water came by way of Edom, and the land was filled with water.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And when all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, all who were able to bear arms and older were <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>gathered; and they stood at the border. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then they rose up early in the morning, and the sun was shining on the water; and the Moabites saw the water on the other side <i>as</i> red as blood. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And they said, &#8220;This is blood; the kings have surely struck swords and have killed one another; now therefore, Moab, to the spoil!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>So when they came to the camp of Israel, Israel rose up and attacked the Moabites, so that they fled before them; and they entered <i>their</i> land, killing the Moabites. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then they destroyed the cities, and each man threw a stone on every good piece of land and filled it; and they stopped up all the springs of water and cut down all the good trees. But they left the stones of Kir Haraseth <i>intact.</i> However the slingers surrounded and attacked it.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too fierce for him, he took with him seven hundred men who drew swords, to break through to the king of Edom, but they could not. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Then he took his eldest son who would have reigned in his place, and offered him <i>as</i> a burnt offering upon the wall; and there was great <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>indignation against Israel. So they departed from him and returned to <i>their own</i> land.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-9588a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Kings 3:11">2 Kings 3:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Was the personal servant of</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9593b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Kings 3:16">2 Kings 3:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>water canals</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9598c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Kings 3:21">2 Kings 3:21</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>summoned</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9604d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Kings 3:27">2 Kings 3:27</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>wrath</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
