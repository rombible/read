And the creditor is coming to take my two sons to be his slaves.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So Elisha said to her, &#8220;What shall I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in the house?&#8221; And she said, &#8220;Your maidservant has nothing in the house but a jar of oil.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then he said, &#8220;Go, borrow vessels from everywhere, from all your neighbors&#8212;empty vessels; do not gather just a few. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And when you have come in, you shall shut the door behind you and your sons; then pour it into all those vessels, and set aside the full ones.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So she went from him and shut the door behind her and her sons, who brought <i>the vessels</i> to her; and she poured <i>it</i> out. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said to her son, &#8220;Bring me another vessel.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-4-6">And he said to her, &#8220;<i>There is</i> not another vessel.&#8221; So the oil ceased. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, &#8220;Go, sell the oil and pay your debt; and you <i>and</i> your sons live on the rest.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Elisha Raises the Shunammite&#8217;s Son</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Kgs-4-8"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Now it happened one day that Elisha went to Shunem, where there <i>was</i> a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>notable woman, and she <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>persuaded him to eat some food. So it was, as often as he passed by, he would turn in there to eat some food. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And she said to her husband, &#8220;Look now, I know that this <i>is</i> a holy man of God, who passes by us regularly. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Please, let us make <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>a small upper room on the wall; and let us put a bed for him there, and a table and a chair and a lampstand; so it will be, whenever he comes to us, he can turn in there.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And it happened one day that he came there, and he turned in to the upper room and lay down there. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then he said to Gehazi his servant, &#8220;Call this Shunammite woman.&#8221; When he had called her, she stood before him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And he said to him, &#8220;Say now to her, &#8216;Look, you have been concerned for us with all this care. What <i>can I</i> do for you? Do you want me to speak on your behalf to the king or to the commander of the army?&#8217; &#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-4-13">She answered, &#8220;I dwell among my own people.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So he said, &#8220;What then <i>is</i> to be done for her?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-4-14">And Gehazi answered, &#8220;Actually, she has no son, and her husband is old.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So he said, &#8220;Call her.&#8221; When he had called her, she stood in the doorway. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then he said, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>&#8220;About this time next year you shall embrace a son.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-4-16">And she said, &#8220;No, my lord. Man of God, do not lie to your maidservant!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But the woman conceived, and bore a son when the appointed time had come, of which Elisha had told her.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And the child grew. Now it happened one day that he went out to his father, to the reapers. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And he said to his father, &#8220;My head, my head!&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-4-19">So he said to a servant, &#8220;Carry him to his mother.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>When he had taken him and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and <i>then</i> died. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, shut <i>the door</i> upon him, and went out. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then she called to her husband, and said, &#8220;Please send me one of the young men and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of God and come back.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>So he said, &#8220;Why are you going to him today? <i>It is</i> neither the New Moon nor the Sabbath.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-4-23">And she said, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>&#8220;<i>It is</i> well.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then she saddled a donkey, and said to her servant, &#8220;Drive, and go forward; do not slacken the pace for me unless I tell you.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And so she departed, and went to the man of God at Mount Carmel.</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-4-25">So it was, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to his servant Gehazi, &#8220;Look, the Shunammite woman! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Please run now to meet her, and say to her, &#8216;<i>Is it</i> well with you? <i>Is it</i> well with your husband? <i>Is it</i> well with the child?&#8217; &#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-4-26">And she answered, &#8220;<i>It is</i> well.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Now when she came to the man of God at the hill, she caught him by the feet, but Gehazi came near to push her away. But the man of God said, &#8220;Let her alone; for her soul <i>is</i> in deep distress, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has hidden <i>it</i> from me, and has not told me.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>So she said, &#8220;Did I ask a son of my lord? Did I not say, &#8216;Do not deceive me&#8217;?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Then he said to Gehazi, &#8220;Get<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span> yourself ready, and take my staff in your hand, and be on your way. If you meet anyone, do not greet him; and if anyone greets you, do not answer him; but lay my staff on the face of the child.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And the mother of the child said, &#8220;<i>As</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> lives, and <i>as</i> your soul lives, I will not leave you.&#8221; So he arose and followed her. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Now Gehazi went on ahead of them, and laid the staff on the face of the child; but <i>there was</i> neither voice nor hearing. Therefore he went back to meet him, and told him, saying, &#8220;The child has not awakened.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>When Elisha came into the house, there was the child, lying dead on his bed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>He went in therefore, shut the door behind the two of them, and prayed to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>And he went up and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth, his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands; and he stretched himself out on the child, and the flesh of the child became warm. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>He returned and walked back and forth in the house, and again went up and stretched himself out on him; then the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>And he called Gehazi and said, &#8220;Call this Shunammite woman.&#8221; So he called her. And when she came in to him, he said, &#8220;Pick up your son.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>So she went in, fell at his feet, and bowed to the ground; then she picked up her son and went out.</span></p> <h3>
Elisha Purifies the Pot of Stew</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Kgs-4-38"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>And Elisha returned to Gilgal, and <i>there was</i> a famine in the land. Now the sons of the prophets <i>were</i> sitting before him; and he said to his servant, &#8220;Put on the large pot, and boil stew for the sons of the prophets.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>So one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered from it a lapful of wild gourds, and came and sliced <i>them</i> into the pot of stew, though they did not know <i>what they were.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>Then they served it to the men to eat. Now it happened, as they were eating the stew, that they cried out and said, &#8220;Man of God, <i>there is</i> death in the pot!&#8221; And they could not eat <i>it.</i></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>So he said, &#8220;Then bring some flour.&#8221; And he put <i>it</i> into the pot, and said, &#8220;Serve <i>it</i> to the people, that they may eat.&#8221; And there was nothing harmful in the pot.</span></p> <h3>
Elisha Feeds One Hundred Men</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Kgs-4-42"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>Then a man came from Baal Shalisha, and brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley bread, and newly ripened grain in his knapsack. And he said, &#8220;Give <i>it</i> to the people, that they may eat.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>But his servant said, &#8220;What? Shall I set this before one hundred men?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-4-43">He said again, &#8220;Give it to the people, that they may eat; for thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8216;They shall eat and have <i>some</i> left over.&#8217; &#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>So he set <i>it</i> before them; and they ate and had <i>some</i> left over, according to the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-9612a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Kings 4:8">2 Kings 4:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>great</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9612b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Kings 4:8">2 Kings 4:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>laid hold on him</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9614c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Kings 4:10">2 Kings 4:10</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>a small walled upper chamber</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9620d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Kings 4:16">2 Kings 4:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>About this season, as the time of life</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9627e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Kings 4:23">2 Kings 4:23</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>It will be well</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9633f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Kings 4:29">2 Kings 4:29</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Gird up your loins.</i> The skirt of the robe was wrapped around the legs and tucked in the belt to gain freedom of movement.</span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
