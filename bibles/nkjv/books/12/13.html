<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he did evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin. He did not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>depart from them.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then the anger of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was aroused against Israel, and He delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of Ben-Hadad the son of Hazael, all <i>their</i> days. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So Jehoahaz pleaded with the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> listened to him; for He saw the oppression of Israel, because the king of Syria oppressed them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> gave Israel a deliverer, so that they escaped from under the hand of the Syrians; and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents as before. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Nevertheless they did not depart from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who had made Israel sin, <i>but</i> walked in them; and the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>wooden image also remained in Samaria. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For He left of the army of Jehoahaz only fifty horsemen, ten chariots, and ten thousand foot soldiers; for the king of Syria had destroyed them and made them like the dust at threshing.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, all that he did, and his might, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So Jehoahaz <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>rested with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria. Then <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>Joash his son reigned in his place.</span></p> <h3>
Jehoash Reigns in Israel</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Kgs-13-10"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>In the thirty-seventh year of Joash king of Judah, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz became king over Israel in Samaria, <i>and reigned</i> sixteen years. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And he did evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. He did not depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel sin, <i>but</i> walked in them.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now the rest of the acts of Joash, all that he did, and his might with which he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So Joash rested<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span> with his fathers. Then Jeroboam sat on his throne. And Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.</span></p> <h3>
Death of Elisha</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Kgs-13-14"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Elisha had become sick with the illness of which he would die. Then Joash the king of Israel came down to him, and wept over his face, and said, &#8220;O my father, my father, the chariots of Israel and their horsemen!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And Elisha said to him, &#8220;Take a bow and some arrows.&#8221; So he took himself a bow and some arrows. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then he said to the king of Israel, &#8220;Put your hand on the bow.&#8221; So he put his hand <i>on it,</i> and Elisha put his hands on the king&#8217;s hands. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;Open the east window&#8221;; and he opened <i>it.</i> Then Elisha said, &#8220;Shoot&#8221;; and he shot. And he said, &#8220;The arrow of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s deliverance and the arrow of deliverance from Syria; for you must strike the Syrians at Aphek till you have destroyed <i>them.</i>&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then he said, &#8220;Take the arrows&#8221;; so he took <i>them.</i> And he said to the king of Israel, &#8220;Strike the ground&#8221;; so he struck three times, and stopped. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And the man of God was angry with him, and said, &#8220;You should have struck five or six times; then you would have struck Syria till you had destroyed <i>it!</i> But now you will strike Syria <i>only</i> three times.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then Elisha <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>died, and they buried him. And the <i>raiding</i> bands from Moab invaded the land in the spring of the year. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>So it was, as they were burying a man, that suddenly they spied a band <i>of raiders;</i> and they put the man in the tomb of Elisha; and when the man was let down and touched the bones of Elisha, he revived and stood on his feet.</span></p> <h3>
Israel Recaptures Cities from Syria</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Kgs-13-22"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>But the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was gracious to them, had compassion on them, and regarded them, because of His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not yet destroy them or cast them from His presence.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Now Hazael king of Syria died. Then Ben-Hadad his son reigned in his place. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz recaptured from the hand of Ben-Hadad, the son of Hazael, the cities which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war.
