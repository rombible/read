And Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, went to him and said to him, &#8220;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8216;Set your house in order, for you shall die, and not live.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then he turned his face toward the wall, and prayed to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8220;Remember now, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, I pray, how I have walked before You in truth and with a loyal heart, and have done <i>what was</i> good in Your sight.&#8221; And Hezekiah wept bitterly.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And it happened, before Isaiah had gone out into the middle court, that the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came to him, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8220;Return and tell Hezekiah the leader of My people, &#8216;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of David your father: &#8220;I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears; surely I will heal you. On the third day you shall go up to the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And I will add to your days fifteen years. I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for My own sake, and for the sake of My servant David.&#8221; &#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then Isaiah said, &#8220;Take a lump of figs.&#8221; So they took and laid <i>it</i> on the boil, and he recovered.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And Hezekiah said to Isaiah, &#8220;What <i>is</i> the sign that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will heal me, and that I shall go up to the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> the third day?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then Isaiah said, &#8220;This is the sign to you from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will do the thing which He has spoken: <i>shall</i> the shadow go forward ten degrees or go backward ten degrees?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And Hezekiah answered, &#8220;It is an easy thing for the shadow to go down ten <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>degrees; no, but let the shadow go backward ten degrees.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So Isaiah the prophet cried out to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and He brought the shadow ten <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>degrees backward, by which it had gone down on the sundial of Ahaz.</span></p> <h3>
The Babylonian Envoys</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Kgs-20-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>At that time <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Berodach-Baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he heard that Hezekiah had been sick. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And Hezekiah was attentive to them, and showed them all the house of his treasures&#8212;the silver and gold, the spices and precious ointment, and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>all <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>his armory&#8212;all that was found among his treasures. There was nothing in his house or in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah, and said to him, &#8220;What did these men say, and from where did they come to you?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-20-14">So Hezekiah said, &#8220;They came from a far country, from Babylon.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;What have they seen in your house?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-20-15">So Hezekiah answered, &#8220;They have seen all that <i>is</i> in my house; there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, &#8220;Hear the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>&#8216;Behold, the days are coming when all that <i>is</i> in your house, and what your fathers have accumulated until this day, shall be carried to Babylon; nothing shall be left,&#8217; says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>&#8216;And they shall take away some of your sons who will <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>descend from you, whom you will beget; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>So Hezekiah said to Isaiah, &#8220;The word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> which you have spoken <i>is</i> good!&#8221; For he said, &#8220;Will there not be peace and truth at least in my days?&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Death of Hezekiah</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Kgs-20-20"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah&#8212;all his might, and how he made a pool and a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>tunnel and brought water into the city&#8212;<i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>So Hezekiah <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>rested with his fathers.
