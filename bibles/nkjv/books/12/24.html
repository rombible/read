Then he turned and rebelled against him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> sent against him <i>raiding</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>bands of Chaldeans, bands of Syrians, bands of Moabites, and bands of the people of Ammon; He sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> which He had spoken by His servants the prophets. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Surely at the commandment of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>this</i> came upon Judah, to remove <i>them</i> from His sight because of the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he had done, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and also because of the innocent blood that he had shed; for he had filled Jerusalem with innocent blood, which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> would not pardon.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So Jehoiakim rested with his fathers. Then Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And the king of Egypt did not come out of his land anymore, for the king of Babylon had taken all that belonged to the king of Egypt from the Brook of Egypt to the River Euphrates.</span></p> <h3>
The Reign and Captivity of Jehoiachin</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Kgs-24-8"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Jehoiachin<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span> <i>was</i> eighteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. His mother&#8217;s name <i>was</i> Nehushta the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And he did evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, according to all that his father had done.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against Jerusalem, and the city <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>was besieged. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city, as his servants were besieging it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then Jehoiachin king of Judah, his mother, his servants, his princes, and his officers went out to the king of Babylon; and the king of Babylon, in the eighth year of his reign, took him prisoner.</span></p> <h3>
The Captivity of Jerusalem</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Kgs-24-13"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And he carried out from there all the treasures of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and the treasures of the king&#8217;s house, and he cut in pieces all the articles of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had said. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Also he carried into captivity all Jerusalem: all the captains and all the mighty men of valor, ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and smiths. None remained except the poorest people of the land. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And he carried Jehoiachin captive to Babylon. The king&#8217;s mother, the king&#8217;s wives, his officers, and the mighty of the land he carried into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>All the valiant men, seven thousand, and craftsmen and smiths, one thousand, all <i>who were</i> strong <i>and</i> fit for war, these the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon.</span></p> <h3>
Zedekiah Reigns in Judah</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Kgs-24-17"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then the king of Babylon made Mattaniah, <i>Jehoiachin&#8217;s</i><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span> uncle, king in his place, and changed his name to Zedekiah.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Zedekiah <i>was</i> twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother&#8217;s name <i>was</i> Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>He also did evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, according to all that Jehoiakim had done. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>For because of the anger of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>this</i> happened in Jerusalem and Judah, that He finally cast them out from His presence.
