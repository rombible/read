His mother&#8217;s name <i>was</i> Hephzibah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he did evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, according to the abominations of the nations whom the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had cast out before the children of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For he rebuilt the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; he raised up altars for Baal, and made a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>wooden image, as Ahab king of Israel had done; and he worshiped all <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>the host of heaven and served them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>He also built altars in the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, of which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had said, &#8220;In Jerusalem I will put My name.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Also he made his son pass through the fire, practiced soothsaying, used witchcraft, and consulted spiritists and mediums. He did much evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, to provoke <i>Him</i> to anger. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>He even set a carved image of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>Asherah that he had made, in the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>house of which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had said to David and to Solomon his son, &#8220;In this house and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put My name forever; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>and I will not make the feet of Israel wander anymore from the land which I gave their fathers&#8212;only if they are careful to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that My servant Moses commanded them.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But they paid no attention, and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil than the nations whom the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had destroyed before the children of Israel.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> spoke by His servants the prophets, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8220;Because Manasseh king of Judah has done these abominations (he has acted more wickedly than all the Amorites who <i>were</i> before him, and has also made Judah sin with his idols), </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>therefore thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel: &#8216;Behold, <i>I</i> am bringing <i>such</i> calamity upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whoever hears of it, both his ears will tingle. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And I will stretch over Jerusalem the measuring line of Samaria and the plummet of the house of Ahab; I will wipe Jerusalem as <i>one</i> wipes a dish, wiping <i>it</i> and turning <i>it</i> upside down. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So I will forsake the remnant of My inheritance and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become victims of plunder to all their enemies, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>because they have done evil in My sight, and have provoked Me to anger since the day their fathers came out of Egypt, even to this day.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Moreover Manasseh shed very much innocent blood, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another, besides his sin by which he made Judah sin, in doing evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh&#8212;all that he did, and the sin that he committed&#8212;<i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>So Manasseh <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>rested with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza. Then his son Amon reigned in his place.</span></p> <h3>
Amon&#8217;s Reign and Death</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Kgs-21-19"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Amon <i>was</i> twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. His mother&#8217;s name <i>was</i> Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And he did evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, as his father Manasseh had done. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>So he walked in all the ways that his father had walked; and he served the idols that his father had served, and worshiped them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>He forsook the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of his fathers, and did not walk in the way of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Then the servants of Amon conspired against him, and killed the king in his own house. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>But the people of the land executed all those who had conspired against King Amon. Then the people of the land made his son Josiah king in his place.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And he was buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzza.
