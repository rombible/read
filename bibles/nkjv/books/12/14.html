<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother&#8217;s name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And he did <i>what was</i> right in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, yet not like his father David; he did everything as his father Joash had done. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>However the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>high places were not taken away, and the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now it happened, as soon as the kingdom was established in his hand, that he executed his servants who had murdered his father the king. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But the children of the murderers he did not execute, according to what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, in which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> commanded, saying, &#8220;Fathers shall not be put to death for their children, nor shall children be put to death for their fathers; but a person shall be put to death for his own sin.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>He killed ten thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt, and took <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>Sela by war, and called its name Joktheel to this day.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then Amaziah sent messengers to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, &#8220;Come, let us face one another <i>in battle.</i>&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And Jehoash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, &#8220;The thistle that <i>was</i> in Lebanon sent to the cedar that <i>was</i> in Lebanon, saying, &#8216;Give your daughter to my son as wife&#8217;; and a wild beast that <i>was</i> in Lebanon passed by and trampled the thistle. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>You have indeed defeated Edom, and your heart has <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>lifted you up. Glory <i>in that,</i> and stay at home; for why should you meddle with trouble so that you fall&#8212;you and Judah with you?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But Amaziah would not heed. Therefore Jehoash king of Israel went out; so he and Amaziah king of Judah faced one another at Beth Shemesh, which <i>belongs</i> to Judah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And Judah was defeated by Israel, and every man fled to his tent. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash, the son of Ahaziah, at Beth Shemesh; and he went to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate&#8212;<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>four hundred cubits. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And he took all the gold and silver, all the articles that were found in the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and in the treasuries of the king&#8217;s house, and hostages, and returned to Samaria.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did&#8212;his might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah&#8212;<i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So Jehoash <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>rested with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. Then Jeroboam his son reigned in his place.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, lived fifteen years after the death of Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And they formed a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish and killed him there. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then they brought him on horses, and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the City of David.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And all the people of Judah took Azariah,<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span> who <i>was</i> sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>He built Elath<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span> and restored it to Judah, after <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>the king rested with his fathers.</span></p> <h3>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>He restored the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>territory of Israel from the entrance of Hamath to the<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span> Sea of the Arabah, according to the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel, which He had spoken through His servant Jonah the son of Amittai, the prophet who <i>was</i> from Gath Hepher. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>For the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> saw <i>that</i> the affliction of Israel <i>was</i> very bitter; and whether bond or free, there was no helper for Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> did not say that He would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven; but He saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash.</span></p> <p>
