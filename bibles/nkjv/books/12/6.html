<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Please, let us go to the Jordan, and let every man take a beam from there, and let us make there a place where we may dwell.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-6-2">So he answered, &#8220;Go.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then one said, &#8220;Please consent to go with your servants.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-6-3">And he answered, &#8220;I will go.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So he went with them. And when they came to the Jordan, they cut down trees. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But as one was cutting down a tree, the iron <i>ax head</i> fell into the water; and he cried out and said, &#8220;Alas, master! For it was borrowed.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So the man of God said, &#8220;Where did it fall?&#8221; And he showed him the place. So he cut off a stick, and threw <i>it</i> in there; and he made the iron float. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Therefore he said, &#8220;Pick <i>it</i> up for yourself.&#8221; So he reached out his hand and took it.</span></p> <h3>
The Blinded Syrians Captured</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Kgs-6-8"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Now the king of Syria was making war against Israel; and he consulted with his servants, saying, &#8220;My camp <i>will be</i> in such and such a place.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And the man of God sent to the king of Israel, saying, &#8220;Beware that you do not pass this place, for the Syrians are coming down there.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then the king of Israel sent <i>someone</i> to the place of which the man of God had told him. Thus he warned him, and he was watchful there, not just once or twice.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was greatly troubled by this thing; and he called his servants and said to them, &#8220;Will you not show me which of us <i>is</i> for the king of Israel?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And one of his servants said, &#8220;None, my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet who <i>is</i> in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedroom.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So he said, &#8220;Go and see where he <i>is,</i> that I may send and get him.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-6-13">And it was told him, saying, &#8220;Surely <i>he is</i> in Dothan.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Therefore he sent horses and chariots and a great army there, and they came by night and surrounded the city. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And when the servant of the man of God arose early and went out, there was an army, surrounding the city with horses and chariots. And his servant said to him, &#8220;Alas, my master! What shall we do?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So he answered, &#8220;Do not fear, for those who <i>are</i> with us <i>are</i> more than those who <i>are</i> with them.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And Elisha prayed, and said, &#8220;<span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, I pray, open his eyes that he may see.&#8221; Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw. And behold, the mountain <i>was</i> full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>So when <i>the Syrians</i> came down to him, Elisha prayed to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and said, &#8220;Strike this people, I pray, with blindness.&#8221; And He struck them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Now Elisha said to them, &#8220;This <i>is</i> not the way, nor <i>is</i> this the city. Follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek.&#8221; But he led them to Samaria.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So it was, when they had come to Samaria, that Elisha said, &#8220;<span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, open the eyes of these <i>men,</i> that they may see.&#8221; And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> opened their eyes, and they saw; and there <i>they were,</i> inside Samaria!</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Now when the king of Israel saw them, he said to Elisha, &#8220;My father, shall I kill <i>them?</i> Shall I kill <i>them?</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But he answered, &#8220;You shall not kill <i>them.</i> Would you kill those whom you have taken captive with your sword and your bow? Set food and water before them, that they may eat and drink and go to their master.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Then he prepared a great feast for them; and after they ate and drank, he sent them away and they went to their master. So the bands of Syrian <i>raiders</i> came no more into the land of Israel.</span></p> <h3>
Syria Besieges Samaria in Famine</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Kgs-6-24"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And it happened after this that Ben-Hadad king of Syria gathered all his army, and went up and besieged Samaria. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And there was a great famine in Samaria; and indeed they besieged it until a donkey&#8217;s head was <i>sold</i> for eighty <i>shekels</i> of silver, and one-fourth of a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>kab of dove droppings for five <i>shekels</i> of silver.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Then, as the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried out to him, saying, &#8220;Help, my lord, O king!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;If the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> does not help you, where can I find help for you? From the threshing floor or from the winepress?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then the king said to her, &#8220;What is troubling you?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-6-28">And she answered, &#8220;This woman said to me, &#8216;Give your son, that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>So we boiled my son, and ate him. And I said to her on the next day, &#8216;Give your son, that we may eat him&#8217;; but she has hidden her son.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Now it happened, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he tore his clothes; and as he passed by on the wall, the people looked, and there underneath <i>he had</i> sackcloth on his body. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Then he said, &#8220;God do so to me and more also, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat remains on him today!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>But Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. And <i>the king</i> sent a man ahead of him, but before the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, &#8220;Do you see how this son of a murderer has sent someone to take away my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door. <i>Is</i> not the sound of his master&#8217;s feet behind him?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And while he was still talking with them, there was the messenger, coming down to him; and then <i>the king</i> said, &#8220;Surely this calamity <i>is</i> from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; why should I wait for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> any longer?&#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-9700a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Kings 6:25">2 Kings 6:25</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Approximately 1 pint</span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
