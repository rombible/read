<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>But <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>Jehosheba, the daughter of King Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king&#8217;s sons <i>who were</i> being murdered; and they hid him and his nurse in the bedroom, from Athaliah, so that he was not killed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So he was hidden with her in the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> for six years, while Athaliah reigned over the land.</span></p> <h3>
Joash Crowned King of Judah</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Kgs-11-4"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>In the seventh year Jehoiada sent and brought the captains of hundreds&#8212;of the bodyguards and the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>escorts&#8212;and brought them into the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> to him. And he made a covenant with them and took an oath from them in the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and showed them the king&#8217;s son. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then he commanded them, saying, &#8220;This <i>is</i> what you shall do: One-third of you who <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>come on duty on the Sabbath shall be keeping watch over the king&#8217;s house, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>one-third <i>shall be</i> at the gate of Sur, and one-third at the gate behind the escorts. You shall keep the watch of the house, lest it be broken down. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>The two <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>contingents of you who go off duty on the Sabbath shall keep the watch of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> for the king. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But you shall surround the king on all sides, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whoever comes within range, let him be put to death. You are to be with the king as he goes out and as he comes in.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So the captains of the hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded. Each of them took his men who were to be on duty on the Sabbath, with those who were going off duty on the Sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And the priest gave the captains of hundreds the spears and shields which <i>had belonged</i> to King David, that were in the temple of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then the escorts stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, all around the king, from the right <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>side of the temple to the left side of the temple, by the altar and the house. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And he brought out the king&#8217;s son, put the crown on him, and <i>gave him</i> the Testimony;<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span> they made him king and anointed him, and they clapped their hands and said, &#8220;Long live the king!&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Death of Athaliah</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Kgs-11-13"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the escorts <i>and</i> the people, she came to the people <i>in</i> the temple of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>When she looked, there was the king standing by a pillar according to custom; and the leaders and the trumpeters were by the king. All the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets. So Athaliah tore her clothes and cried out, &#8220;Treason! Treason!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds, the officers of the army, and said to them, &#8220;Take her outside <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>under guard, and slay with the sword whoever follows her.&#8221; For the priest had said, &#8220;Do not let her be killed in the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So they seized her; and she went by way of the horses&#8217; entrance <i>into</i> the king&#8217;s house, and there she was killed.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then Jehoiada made a covenant between the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, the king, and the people, that they should be the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s people, and <i>also</i> between the king and the people. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And all the people of the land went to the temple of Baal, and tore it down. They thoroughly broke in pieces its altars and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>images, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>officers over the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then he took the captains of hundreds, the bodyguards, the escorts, and all the people of the land; and they brought the king down from the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and went by way of the gate of the escorts to the king&#8217;s house. Then he sat on the throne of the kings. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So all the people of the land rejoiced; and the city was quiet, for they had slain Athaliah with the sword <i>in</i> the king&#8217;s house. </span>
