He was also a mighty man of valor, <i>but</i> a leper. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And the Syrians had gone out on<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span> raids, and had brought back captive a young girl from the land of Israel. She <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>waited on Naaman&#8217;s wife. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then she said to her mistress, &#8220;If only my master <i>were</i> with the prophet who <i>is</i> in Samaria! For he would heal him of his leprosy.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And <i>Naaman</i> went in and told his master, saying, &#8220;Thus and thus said the girl who <i>is</i> from the land of Israel.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then the king of Syria said, &#8220;Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-5-5">So he departed and took with him ten talents of silver, six thousand <i>shekels</i> of gold, and ten changes of clothing. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then he brought the letter to the king of Israel, which said,</span></p><div class="left-1 top-1"><p class="first-line-none"><span class="text 2Kgs-5-6">Now be advised, when this letter comes to you, that I have sent Naaman my servant to you, that you may heal him of his leprosy.</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And it happened, when the king of Israel read the letter, that he tore his clothes and said, &#8220;<i>Am</i> I God, to kill and make alive, that this man sends a man to me to heal him of his leprosy? Therefore please consider, and see how he seeks a quarrel with me.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So it was, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, &#8220;Why have you torn your clothes? Please let him come to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then Naaman went with his horses and chariot, and he stood at the door of Elisha&#8217;s house. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, &#8220;Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall be restored to you, and <i>you shall</i> be clean.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But Naaman became furious, and went away and said, &#8220;Indeed, I said to myself, &#8216;He will surely come out <i>to me,</i> and stand and call on the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> his God, and wave his hand over the place, and heal the leprosy.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span><i>Are</i> not the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Abanah and the Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them and be clean?&#8221; So he turned and went away in a rage. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And his servants came near and spoke to him, and said, &#8220;My father, <i>if</i> the prophet had told you <i>to do</i> something great, would you not have done <i>it?</i> How much more then, when he says to you, &#8216;Wash, and be clean&#8217;?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So he went down and dipped seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And he returned to the man of God, he and all his aides, and came and stood before him; and he said, &#8220;Indeed, now I know that <i>there is</i> no God in all the earth, except in Israel; now therefore, please take a gift from your servant.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But he said, &#8220;<i>As</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> lives, before whom I stand, I will receive nothing.&#8221; And he urged him to take <i>it,</i> but he refused.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So Naaman said, &#8220;Then, if not, please let your servant be given two mule-loads of earth; for your servant will no longer offer either burnt offering or sacrifice to other gods, but to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Yet in this thing may the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> pardon your servant: when my master goes into the temple of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my hand, and I bow down in the temple of Rimmon&#8212;when I bow down in the temple of Rimmon, may the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> please pardon your servant in this thing.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then he said to him, &#8220;Go in peace.&#8221; So he departed from him a short distance.</span></p> <h3>
Gehazi&#8217;s Greed</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Kgs-5-20"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, &#8220;Look, my master has spared Naaman this Syrian, while not receiving from his hands what he brought; but <i>as</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> lives, I will run after him and take something from him.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>So Gehazi pursued Naaman. When Naaman saw <i>him</i> running after him, he got down from the chariot to meet him, and said, &#8220;<i>Is</i> all well?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;All <i>is</i> well. My master has sent me, saying, &#8216;Indeed, just now two young men of the sons of the prophets have come to me from the mountains of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of silver and two changes of garments.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>So Naaman said, &#8220;Please, take two talents.&#8221; And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and handed <i>them</i> to two of his servants; and they carried <i>them</i> on ahead of him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>When he came to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>the citadel, he took <i>them</i> from their hand, and stored <i>them</i> away in the house; then he let the men go, and they departed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Now he went in and stood before his master. Elisha said to him, &#8220;Where <i>did you go,</i> Gehazi?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-5-25">And he said, &#8220;Your servant did not go anywhere.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Then he said to him, &#8220;Did not my heart go <i>with you</i> when the man turned back from his chariot to meet you? <i>Is it</i> time to receive money and to receive clothing, olive groves and vineyards, sheep and oxen, male and female servants? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Therefore the leprosy of Naaman shall cling to you and your descendants forever.&#8221; And he went out from his presence leprous, <i>as white</i> as snow.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-9650a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Kings 5:2">2 Kings 5:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>in bands</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9650b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Kings 5:2">2 Kings 5:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Served, lit. <i>was before</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9660c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Kings 5:12">2 Kings 5:12</span> <span class='footnote-text'>So with Kt., LXX, Vg.; Qr., Syr., Tg. <i>Amanah</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-9672d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Kings 5:24">2 Kings 5:24</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>the hill</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
