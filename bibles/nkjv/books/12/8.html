<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So the woman arose and did according to the saying of the man of God, and she went with her household and dwelt in the land of the Philistines seven years.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>It came to pass, at the end of seven years, that the woman returned from the land of the Philistines; and she went to make an appeal to the king for her house and for her land. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then the king talked with Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, saying, &#8220;Tell me, please, all the great things Elisha has done.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now it happened, as he was telling the king how he had restored the dead to life, that there was the woman whose son he had restored to life, appealing to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi said, &#8220;My lord, O king, this <i>is</i> the woman, and this <i>is</i> her son whom Elisha restored to life.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And when the king asked the woman, she told him.</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-8-6">So the king appointed a certain officer for her, saying, &#8220;Restore all that <i>was</i> hers, and all the proceeds of the field from the day that she left the land until now.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Death of Ben-Hadad</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Kgs-8-7"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then Elisha went to Damascus, and Ben-Hadad king of Syria was sick; and it was told him, saying, &#8220;The man of God has come here.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And the king said to Hazael, &#8220;Take a present in your hand, and go to meet the man of God, and inquire of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> by him, saying, &#8216;Shall I recover from this disease?&#8217; &#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So Hazael went to meet him and took a present with him, of every good thing of Damascus, forty camel-loads; and he came and stood before him, and said, &#8220;Your son Ben-Hadad king of Syria has sent me to you, saying, &#8216;Shall I recover from this disease?&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And Elisha said to him, &#8220;Go, say to him, &#8216;You shall certainly recover.&#8217; However the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has shown me that he will really die.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then he <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>set his countenance in a stare until he was ashamed; and the man of God wept. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And Hazael said, &#8220;Why is my lord weeping?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-8-12">He answered, &#8220;Because I know the evil that you will do to the children of Israel: Their strongholds you will set on fire, and their young men you will kill with the sword; and you will dash their children, and rip open their women with child.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So Hazael said, &#8220;But what <i>is</i> your servant&#8212;a dog, that he should do this gross thing?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-8-13">And Elisha answered, &#8220;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has shown me that you <i>will become</i> king over Syria.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then he departed from Elisha, and came to his master, who said to him, &#8220;What did Elisha say to you?&#8221; And he answered, &#8220;He told me you would surely recover.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But it happened on the next day that he took a thick cloth and dipped <i>it</i> in water, and spread <i>it</i> over his face so that he died; and Hazael reigned in his place.</span></p> <h3>
Jehoram Reigns in Judah</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Kgs-8-16"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Now in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab, king of Israel, Jehoshaphat <i>having been</i> king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat began to reign as <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>king of Judah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>He was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab had done, for the daughter of Ahab was his wife; and he did evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Yet the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> would not destroy Judah, for the sake of His servant David, as He promised him to give a lamp to him <i>and</i> his sons forever.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>In his days Edom revolted against Judah&#8217;s authority, and made a king over themselves. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>So <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Joram went to Zair, and all his chariots with him. Then he rose by night and attacked the Edomites who had surrounded him and the captains of the chariots; and the troops fled to their tents. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Thus Edom has been in revolt against Judah&#8217;s authority to this day. And Libnah revolted at that time.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Now the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>So Joram <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of David. Then Ahaziah<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span> his son reigned in his place.</span></p> <h3>
Ahaziah Reigns in Judah</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Kgs-8-25"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab, king of Israel, Ahaziah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, began to reign. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Ahaziah <i>was</i> twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother&#8217;s name <i>was</i> Athaliah the granddaughter of Omri, king of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, like the house of Ahab, for he <i>was</i> the son-in-law of the house of Ahab.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Now he went with Joram the son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth Gilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Then King Joram went back to Jezreel to recover from the wounds which the Syrians had inflicted on him at <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria.
