<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>All those <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>who were descendants of Jacob were seventy<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span> persons (for Joseph was in Egypt <i>already</i>). </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And Joseph died, all his brothers, and all that generation. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But the children of Israel were fruitful and increased abundantly, multiplied and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>grew exceedingly mighty; and the land was filled with them.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who did not know Joseph. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And he said to his people, &#8220;Look, the people of the children of Israel <i>are</i> more and mightier than we; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>come, let us deal shrewdly with them, lest they multiply, and it happen, in the event of war, that they also join our enemies and fight against us, and <i>so</i> go up out of the land.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Therefore they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh supply cities, Pithom and Raamses. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were in dread of the children of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So the Egyptians made the children of Israel serve with <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>rigor. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage&#8212;in mortar, in brick, and in all manner of service in the field. All their service in which they made them serve <i>was</i> with rigor.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of one <i>was</i> Shiphrah and the name of the other Puah; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>and he said, &#8220;When you do the duties of a midwife for the Hebrew women, and see <i>them</i> on the birthstools, if it <i>is</i> a son, then you shall kill him; but if it <i>is</i> a daughter, then she shall live.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But the midwives feared God, and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the male children alive. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>So the king of Egypt called for the midwives and said to them, &#8220;Why have you done this thing, and saved the male children alive?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And the midwives said to Pharaoh, &#8220;Because the Hebrew women <i>are</i> not like the Egyptian women; for they <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span><i>are</i> lively and give birth before the midwives come to them.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Therefore God dealt well with the midwives, and the people multiplied and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>grew very mighty. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And so it was, because the midwives feared God, that He <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>provided households for them.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, &#8220;Every son who is <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>born you shall cast into the river, and every daughter you shall save alive.&#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-1538a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 1:5">Exodus 1:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>who came from the loins of</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1538b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 1:5">Exodus 1:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'>DSS, LXX <i>seventy-five;</i> cf. <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Acts.7.14" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=Acts.7.14&amp;version=NKJV">Acts 7:14</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1540c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 1:7">Exodus 1:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>became very numerous</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1546d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 1:13">Exodus 1:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>harshness</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1552e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 1:19">Exodus 1:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>have vigor of life,</i> bear quickly, easily</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1553f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 1:20">Exodus 1:20</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>became very numerous</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1554g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 1:21">Exodus 1:21</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>gave them families</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1555h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 1:22">Exodus 1:22</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Sam., LXX, Tg. add <i>to the Hebrews</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
