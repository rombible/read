<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Aaron said to them, &#8220;Break off the golden earrings which <i>are</i> in the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring <i>them</i> to me.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So all the people broke off the golden earrings which <i>were</i> in their ears, and brought <i>them</i> to Aaron. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And he received <i>the gold</i> from their hand, and he fashioned it with an engraving tool, and made a molded calf.</span></p><p><span class="text Exod-32-4">Then they said, &#8220;This <i>is</i> your god, O Israel, that brought you out of the land of Egypt!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So when Aaron saw <i>it,</i> he built an altar before it. And Aaron made a proclamation and said, &#8220;Tomorrow <i>is</i> a feast to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then they rose early on the next day, offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;Go, get down! For your people whom you brought out of the land of Egypt have corrupted <i>themselves.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them. They have made themselves a molded calf, and worshiped it and sacrificed to it, and said, &#8216;This <i>is</i> your god, O Israel, that brought you out of the land of Egypt!&#8217; &#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;I have seen this people, and indeed it <i>is</i> a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>stiff-necked people! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Now therefore, let Me alone, that My wrath may burn hot against them and I may <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>consume them. And I will make of you a great nation.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then Moses pleaded with <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> his God, and said: &#8220;<span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, why does Your wrath burn hot against Your people whom You have brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Why should the Egyptians speak, and say, &#8216;He brought them out to harm them, to kill them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth&#8217;? Turn from Your fierce wrath, and relent from this harm to Your people. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, Your servants, to whom You swore by Your own self, and said to them, &#8216;I will multiply your descendants as the stars of heaven; and all this land that I have spoken of I give to your descendants, and they shall inherit <i>it</i> forever.&#8217; &#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> relented from the harm which He said He would do to His people.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And Moses turned and went down from the mountain, and the two tablets of the Testimony <i>were</i> in his hand. The tablets <i>were</i> written on both sides; on the one <i>side</i> and on the other they were written. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Now the tablets <i>were</i> the work of God, and the writing <i>was</i> the writing of God engraved on the tablets.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, &#8220;<i>There is</i> a noise of war in the camp.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>But he said:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Exod-32-18">&#8220;<i>It is</i> not the noise of the shout of victory,</span><br /><span class="text Exod-32-18">Nor the noise of the cry of defeat,</span><br /><span class="text Exod-32-18"><i>But</i> the sound of singing I hear.&#8221;</span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>So it was, as soon as he came near the camp, that he saw the calf <i>and</i> the dancing. So Moses&#8217; anger became hot, and he cast the tablets out of his hands and broke them at the foot of the mountain. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then he took the calf which they had made, burned <i>it</i> in the fire, and ground <i>it</i> to powder; and he scattered <i>it</i> on the water and made the children of Israel drink <i>it.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And Moses said to Aaron, &#8220;What did this people do to you that you have brought <i>so</i> great a sin upon them?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So Aaron said, &#8220;Do not let the anger of my lord become hot. You know the people, that they <i>are set</i> on evil. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>For they said to me, &#8216;Make us gods that shall go before us; <i>as for</i> this Moses, the man who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And I said to them, &#8216;Whoever has any gold, let them break <i>it</i> off.&#8217; So they gave <i>it</i> to me, and I cast it into the fire, and this calf came out.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Now when Moses saw that the people <i>were</i> unrestrained (for Aaron had not restrained them, to <i>their</i> shame among their enemies), </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>then Moses stood in the entrance of the camp, and said, &#8220;Whoever <i>is</i> on the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s side&#8212;<i>come</i> to me!&#8221; And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together to him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And he said to them, &#8220;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel: &#8216;Let every man put his sword on his side, and go in and out from entrance to entrance throughout the camp, and let every man kill his brother, every man his companion, and every man his neighbor.&#8217; &#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>So the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses. And about three thousand men of the people fell that day. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Then Moses said, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>&#8220;Consecrate yourselves today to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, that He may bestow on you a blessing this day, for every man has opposed his son and his brother.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Now it came to pass on the next day that Moses said to the people, &#8220;You have committed a great sin. So now I will go up to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Then Moses returned to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and said, &#8220;Oh, these people have committed a great sin, and have made for themselves a god of gold! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Yet now, if You will forgive their sin&#8212;but if not, I pray, blot me out of Your book which You have written.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;Whoever has sinned against Me, I will blot him out of My book. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Now therefore, go, lead the people to <i>the place</i> of which I have spoken to you. Behold, My Angel shall go before you. Nevertheless, in the day when I visit for punishment, I will visit punishment upon them for their sin.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> plagued the people because of what they did with the calf which Aaron made.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-2440a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 32:1">Exodus 32:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>a god</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-2448b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 32:9">Exodus 32:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>stubborn</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-2449c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 32:10">Exodus 32:10</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>destroy</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-2450d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 32:11">Exodus 32:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>the face of the <span class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span></i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-2468e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 32:29">Exodus 32:29</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Fill your hand</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
