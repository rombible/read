<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>You shall speak all that I command you. And Aaron your brother shall tell Pharaoh to send the children of Israel out of his land. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And I will harden Pharaoh&#8217;s heart, and multiply My signs and My wonders in the land of Egypt. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But Pharaoh will not heed you, so that I may lay My hand on Egypt and bring My <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>armies <i>and</i> My people, the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And the Egyptians shall know that I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, when I stretch out My hand on Egypt and bring out the children of Israel from among them.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then Moses and Aaron did <i>so;</i> just as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> commanded them, so they did. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And Moses <i>was</i> eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three years old when they spoke to Pharaoh.</span></p> <h3>
Aaron&#8217;s Miraculous Rod</span></h3><p><span class="text Exod-7-8"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;When Pharaoh speaks to you, saying, &#8216;Show a miracle for yourselves,&#8217; then you shall say to Aaron, &#8216;Take your rod and cast <i>it</i> before Pharaoh, <i>and</i> let it become a serpent.&#8217; &#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and they did so, just as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> commanded. And Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a serpent.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But Pharaoh also called the wise men and the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>sorcerers; so the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>enchantments. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>For every man threw down his rod, and they became serpents. But Aaron&#8217;s rod swallowed up their rods. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And Pharaoh&#8217;s heart grew hard, and he did not heed them, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had said.</span></p> <h3>
The First Plague: Waters Become Blood</span></h3><p><span class="text Exod-7-14"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses: &#8220;Pharaoh&#8217;s heart <i>is</i> hard; he refuses to let the people go. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Go to Pharaoh in the morning, when he goes out to the water, and you shall stand by the river&#8217;s bank to meet him; and the rod which was turned to a serpent you shall take in your hand. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And you shall say to him, &#8216;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of the Hebrews has sent me to you, saying, &#8220;Let My people go, that they may <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>serve Me in the wilderness&#8221;; but indeed, until now you would not hear! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8220;By this you shall know that I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. Behold, I will strike the waters which <i>are</i> in the river with the rod that <i>is</i> in my hand, and they shall be turned to blood. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And the fish that <i>are</i> in the river shall die, the river shall stink, and the Egyptians will loathe<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span> to drink the water of the river.&#8221; &#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, &#8220;Say to Aaron, &#8216;Take your rod and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt, over their streams, over their rivers, over their ponds, and over all their pools of water, that they may become blood. And there shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in <i>buckets of</i> wood and <i>pitchers of</i> stone.&#8217; &#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And Moses and Aaron did so, just as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> commanded. So he lifted up the rod and struck the waters that <i>were</i> in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh and in the sight of his servants.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>The fish that <i>were</i> in the river died, the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink the water of the river. So there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then the magicians of Egypt did so with their <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>enchantments; and Pharaoh&#8217;s heart grew hard, and he did not heed them, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had said. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And Pharaoh turned and went into his house. Neither was his heart moved by this. </span>
