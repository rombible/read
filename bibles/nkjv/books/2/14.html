<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Speak to the children of Israel, that they turn and camp before Pi Hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, opposite Baal Zephon; you shall camp before it by the sea. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, &#8216;They <i>are</i> bewildered by the land; the wilderness has closed them in.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then I will harden Pharaoh&#8217;s heart, so that he will pursue them; and I will gain honor over Pharaoh and over all his army, that the Egyptians may know that I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221; And they did so.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now it was told the king of Egypt that the people had fled, and the heart of Pharaoh and his servants was turned against the people; and they said, &#8220;Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So he <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>made ready his chariot and took his people with him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Also, he took six hundred choice chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt with captains over every one of them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued the children of Israel; and the children of Israel went out with boldness. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So the Egyptians pursued them, all the horses <i>and</i> chariots of Pharaoh, his horsemen and his army, and overtook them camping by the sea beside Pi Hahiroth, before Baal Zephon.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And when Pharaoh drew near, the children of Israel lifted their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians marched after them. So they were very afraid, and the children of Israel cried out to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then they said to Moses, &#8220;Because <i>there were</i> no graves in Egypt, have you taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why have you so dealt with us, to bring us up out of Egypt? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span><i>Is</i> this not the word that we told you in Egypt, saying, &#8216;Let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians&#8217;? For <i>it would have been</i> better for us to serve the Egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And Moses said to the people, &#8220;Do not be afraid. Stand still, and see the salvation<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span> of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, which He will accomplish for you today. For the Egyptians whom you see today, you shall see again no more forever. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will fight for you, and you shall hold<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> your peace.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;Why do you cry to Me? Tell the children of Israel to go forward. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But lift up your rod, and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it. And the children of Israel shall go on dry <i>ground</i> through the midst of the sea. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And I indeed will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them. So I will gain honor over Pharaoh and over all his army, his chariots, and his horsemen. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then the Egyptians shall know that I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, when I have gained honor for Myself over Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And the Angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud went from before them and stood behind them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel. Thus it was a cloud and darkness <i>to the one,</i> and it gave light by night <i>to the other,</i> so that the one did not come near the other all that night.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> caused the sea to go <i>back</i> by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea into dry <i>land,</i> and the waters were divided. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea on the dry <i>ground,</i> and the waters <i>were</i> a wall to them on their right hand and on their left. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And the Egyptians pursued and went after them into the midst of the sea, all Pharaoh&#8217;s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Now it came to pass, in the morning watch, that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> looked down upon the army of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and cloud, and He <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>troubled the army of the Egyptians. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And He <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>took off their chariot wheels, so that they drove them with difficulty; and the Egyptians said, &#8220;Let us flee from the face of Israel, for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> fights for them against the Egyptians.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the waters may come back upon the Egyptians, on their chariots, and on their horsemen.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and when the morning appeared, the sea returned to its full depth, while the Egyptians were fleeing into it. So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> overthrew<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span> the Egyptians in the midst of the sea. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then the waters returned and covered the chariots, the horsemen, <i>and</i> all the army of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them. Not so much as one of them remained. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>But the children of Israel had walked on dry <i>land</i> in the midst of the sea, and the waters <i>were</i> a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> saved<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span> Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Thus Israel saw the great <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>work which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had done in Egypt; so the people feared the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and believed the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and His servant Moses.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-1896a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 14:6">Exodus 14:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>harnessed</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1903b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 14:13">Exodus 14:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>deliverance</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1904c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 14:14">Exodus 14:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>be quiet</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1914d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 14:24">Exodus 14:24</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>confused</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1915e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 14:25">Exodus 14:25</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Sam., LXX, Syr. <i>bound</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1917f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 14:27">Exodus 14:27</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>shook off</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1920g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 14:30">Exodus 14:30</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>delivered</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1921h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 14:31">Exodus 14:31</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>hand with which the <span class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> worked</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
