<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>If you buy a Hebrew servant, he shall serve six years; and in the seventh he shall go out free and pay nothing. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>If he comes in by himself, he shall go out by himself; if he <i>comes in</i> married, then his wife shall go out with him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>If his master has given him a wife, and she has borne him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall be her master&#8217;s, and he shall go out by himself. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But if the servant plainly says, &#8216;I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free,&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>then his master shall bring him to the judges. He shall also bring him to the door, or to the doorpost, and his master shall pierce his ear with an awl; and he shall serve him forever.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8220;And if a man sells his daughter to be a female slave, she shall not go out as the male slaves do. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>If she <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>does not please her master, who has betrothed her to himself, then he shall let her be redeemed. He shall have no right to sell her to a foreign people, since he has dealt deceitfully with her. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And if he has betrothed her to his son, he shall deal with her according to the custom of daughters. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>If he takes another <i>wife,</i> he shall not diminish her food, her clothing, and her marriage rights. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And if he does not do these three for her, then she shall go out free, without <i>paying</i> money.</span></p> <h3>
The Law Concerning Violence</span></h3><p><span class="text Exod-21-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>&#8220;He who strikes a man so that he dies shall surely be put to death. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>However, if he did not lie in wait, but God delivered <i>him</i> into his hand, then I will appoint for you a place where he may flee.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>&#8220;But if a man acts with premeditation against his neighbor, to kill him by treachery, you shall take him from My altar, that he may die.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>&#8220;And he who strikes his father or his mother shall surely be put to death.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>&#8220;He who kidnaps a man and sells him, or if he is found in his hand, shall surely be put to death.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>&#8220;And he who curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>&#8220;If men contend with each other, and one strikes the other with a stone or with <i>his</i> fist, and he does not die but is confined to <i>his</i> bed, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>if he rises again and walks about outside with his staff, then he who struck <i>him</i> shall be <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>acquitted.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>&#8220;And if a man beats his male or female servant with a rod, so that he dies under his hand, he shall surely be punished. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Notwithstanding, if he remains alive a day or two, he shall not be punished; for he <i>is</i> his property.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>&#8220;If men <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>fight, and hurt a woman with child, so that <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>she gives birth prematurely, yet no harm follows, he shall surely be punished accordingly as the woman&#8217;s husband imposes on him; and he shall pay as the judges <i>determine.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>But if <i>any</i> harm follows, then you shall give life for life, </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>&#8220;If a man strikes the eye of his male or female servant, and destroys it, he shall let him go free for the sake of his eye. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And if he knocks out the tooth of his male or female servant, he shall let him go free for the sake of his tooth.</span></p> <h3>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>But if the ox <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>tended to thrust with its horn in times past, and it has been made known to his owner, and he has not kept it confined, so that it has killed a man or a woman, the ox shall be stoned and its owner also shall be put to death. </span>
