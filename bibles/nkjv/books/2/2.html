<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So the woman conceived and bore a son. And when she saw that he <i>was</i> a beautiful <i>child,</i> she hid him three months. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But when she could no longer hide him, she took an ark of bulrushes for him, daubed it with asphalt and pitch, put the child in it, and laid <i>it</i> in the reeds by the river&#8217;s bank. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And his sister stood afar off, to know what would be done to him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river. And her maidens walked along the riverside; and when she saw the ark among the reeds, she sent her maid to get it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And when she opened <i>it,</i> she saw the child, and behold, the baby wept. So she had compassion on him, and said, &#8220;This is one of the Hebrews&#8217; children.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then his sister said to Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter, &#8220;Shall I go and call a nurse for you from the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for you?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter said to her, &#8220;Go.&#8221; So the maiden went and called the child&#8217;s mother. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter said to her, &#8220;Take this child away and nurse him for me, and I will give <i>you</i> your wages.&#8221; So the woman took the child and nursed him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter, and he became her son. So she called his name <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>Moses, saying, &#8220;Because I drew him out of the water.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Moses Flees to Midian</span></h3><p><span class="text Exod-2-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out to his brethren and looked at their burdens. And he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his brethren. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So he looked this way and that way, and when he saw no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And when he went out the second day, behold, two Hebrew men were fighting, and he said to the one who did the wrong, &#8220;Why are you striking your companion?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then he said, &#8220;Who made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you intend to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Exod-2-14">So Moses feared and said, &#8220;Surely this thing is known!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>When Pharaoh heard of this matter, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>the face of Pharaoh and dwelt in the land of Midian; and he sat down by a well.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters. And they came and drew water, and they filled the troughs to water their father&#8217;s flock. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then the shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>When they came to Reuel<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> their father, he said, &#8220;How <i>is it that</i> you have come so soon today?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And they said, &#8220;An Egyptian delivered us from the hand of the shepherds, and he also drew enough water for us and watered the flock.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So he said to his daughters, &#8220;And where <i>is</i> he? Why <i>is</i> it <i>that</i> you have left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then Moses was content to live with the man, and he gave Zipporah his daughter to Moses. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And she bore <i>him</i> a son. He called his name Gershom,<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span> for he said, &#8220;I have been a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>stranger in a foreign land.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Now it happened in the process of time that the king of Egypt died. Then the children of Israel groaned because of the bondage, and they cried out; and their cry came up to God because of the bondage. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>So God heard their groaning, and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God acknowledged <i>them.</i></span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-1565a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 2:10">Exodus 2:10</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. <i>Mosheh,</i> lit. <i>Drawn Out</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1570b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 2:15">Exodus 2:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>the presence of Pharaoh</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1573c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 2:18">Exodus 2:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Jethro,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Exod.3.1" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=Exod.3.1&amp;version=NKJV">Ex. 3:1</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1577d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 2:22">Exodus 2:22</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Stranger There</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1577e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 2:22">Exodus 2:22</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>sojourner,</i> temporary resident</span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
