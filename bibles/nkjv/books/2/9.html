<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>For if you refuse to let <i>them</i> go, and still hold them, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>behold, the hand of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will be on your cattle in the field, on the horses, on the donkeys, on the camels, on the oxen, and on the sheep&#8212;a very severe pestilence. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will make a difference between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt. So nothing shall die of all <i>that</i> belongs to the children of Israel.&#8221; &#8217; &#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> appointed a set time, saying, &#8220;Tomorrow the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will do this thing in the land.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> did this thing on the next day, and all the livestock of Egypt died; but of the livestock of the children of Israel, not one died. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then Pharaoh sent, and indeed, not even one of the livestock of the Israelites was dead. But the heart of Pharaoh became hard, and he did not let the people go.</span></p> <h3>
The Sixth Plague: Boils</span></h3><p><span class="text Exod-9-8"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses and Aaron, &#8220;Take for yourselves handfuls of ashes from a furnace, and let Moses scatter it toward the heavens in the sight of Pharaoh. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And it will become fine dust in all the land of Egypt, and it will cause boils that break out in sores on man and beast throughout all the land of Egypt.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then they took ashes from the furnace and stood before Pharaoh, and Moses scattered <i>them</i> toward heaven. And <i>they</i> caused boils that break out in sores on man and beast. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils, for the boils were on the magicians and on all the Egyptians. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> hardened the heart of Pharaoh; and he did not heed them, just as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had spoken to Moses.</span></p> <h3>
The Seventh Plague: Hail</span></h3><p><span class="text Exod-9-13"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;Rise early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh, and say to him, &#8216;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of the Hebrews: &#8220;Let My people go, that they may serve Me, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>for at this time I will send all My plagues to your very heart, and on your servants and on your people, that you may know that <i>there is</i> none like Me in all the earth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Now if I had stretched out My hand and struck you and your people with pestilence, then you would have been cut off from the earth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But indeed for this <i>purpose</i> I have raised you up, that I may show My power <i>in</i> you, and that My name may be declared in all the earth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>As yet you exalt yourself against My people in that you will not let them go. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Behold, tomorrow about this time I will cause very heavy hail to rain down, such as has not been in Egypt since its founding until now. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Therefore send now <i>and</i> gather your livestock and all that you have in the field, for the hail shall come down on every man and every animal which is found in the field and is not brought home; and they shall die.&#8221; &#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>He who feared the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his livestock flee to the houses. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>But he who did not regard the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> left his servants and his livestock in the field.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;Stretch out your hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt&#8212;on man, on beast, and on every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And Moses stretched out his rod toward heaven; and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> sent thunder and hail, and fire darted to the ground. And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> rained hail on the land of Egypt. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, so very heavy that there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And the hail struck throughout the whole land of Egypt, all that <i>was</i> in the field, both man and beast; and the hail struck every herb of the field and broke every tree of the field. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel <i>were,</i> there was no hail.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And Pharaoh sent and called for Moses and Aaron, and said to them, &#8220;I have sinned this time. The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>is</i> righteous, and my people and I <i>are</i> wicked. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Entreat<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, that there may be no <i>more</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>mighty thundering and hail, for <i>it is</i> enough. I will let you go, and you shall stay no longer.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>So Moses said to him, &#8220;As soon as I have gone out of the city, I will spread out my hands to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; the thunder will cease, and there will be no more hail, that you may know that the earth <i>is</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>But as for you and your servants, I know that you will not yet fear the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Now the flax and the barley were struck, for the barley <i>was</i> in the head and the flax <i>was</i> in bud. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>But the wheat and the spelt were not struck, for they <i>are</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>late crops.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>So Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh and spread out his hands to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; then the thunder and the hail ceased, and the rain was not poured on the earth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>And when Pharaoh saw that the rain, the hail, and the thunder had ceased, he sinned yet more; and he hardened his heart, he and his servants. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>So the heart of Pharaoh was hard; neither would he let the children of Israel go, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had spoken by Moses.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-1771a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 9:28">Exodus 9:28</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Pray to, Make supplication to</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1771b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 9:28">Exodus 9:28</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>voices of God</i> or <i>sounds of God</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1775c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 9:32">Exodus 9:32</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>darkened</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
