<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>But if you refuse to let <i>them</i> go, behold, I will smite all your territory with frogs. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into your house, into your bedroom, on your bed, into the houses of your servants, on your people, into your ovens, and into your kneading bowls. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And the frogs shall come up on you, on your people, and on all your servants.&#8221; &#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, &#8220;Say to Aaron, &#8216;Stretch out your hand with your rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up on the land of Egypt.&#8217; &#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And the magicians did so with their <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>enchantments, and brought up frogs on the land of Egypt.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, &#8220;Entreat<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> that He may take away the frogs from me and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And Moses said to Pharaoh, &#8220;Accept the honor of saying when I shall intercede for you, for your servants, and for your people, to destroy the frogs from you and your houses, <i>that</i> they may remain in the river only.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So he said, &#8220;Tomorrow.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;<i>Let it be</i> according to your word, that you may know that <i>there is</i> no one like the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And the frogs shall depart from you, from your houses, from your servants, and from your people. They shall remain in the river only.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh. And Moses cried out to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> concerning the frogs which He had brought against Pharaoh. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> did according to the word of Moses. And the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courtyards, and out of the fields. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>They gathered them together in heaps, and the land stank. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart and did not heed them, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had said.</span></p> <h3>
The Third Plague: Lice</span></h3><p><span class="text Exod-8-16"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;Say to Aaron, &#8216;Stretch out your rod, and strike the dust of the land, so that it may become <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>lice throughout all the land of Egypt.&#8217; &#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And they did so. For Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod and struck the dust of the earth, and it became lice on man and beast. All the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Now the magicians so worked with their <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not. So there were lice on man and beast. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, &#8220;This <i>is</i> the<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span> finger of God.&#8221; But Pharaoh&#8217;s heart grew hard, and he did not heed them, just as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had said.</span></p> <h3>
The Fourth Plague: Flies</span></h3><p><span class="text Exod-8-20"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;Rise early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh as he comes out to the water. Then say to him, &#8216;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8220;Let My people go, that they may serve Me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Or else, if you will not let My people go, behold, I will send swarms <i>of flies</i> on you and your servants, on your people and into your houses. The houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms <i>of flies,</i> and also the ground on which they <i>stand.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And in that day I will set apart the land of Goshen, in which My people dwell, that no swarms <i>of flies</i> shall be there, in order that you may know that I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> in the midst of the land. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>I will <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>make a difference between My people and your people. Tomorrow this sign shall be.&#8221; &#8217; &#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> did so. Thick swarms <i>of flies</i> came into the house of Pharaoh, <i>into</i> his servants&#8217; houses, and into all the land of Egypt. The land was corrupted because of the swarms <i>of flies.</i></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, &#8220;Go, sacrifice to your God in the land.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And Moses said, &#8220;It is not right to do so, for we would be sacrificing the abomination of the Egyptians to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God. If we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, then will they not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>stone us? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>We will go three days&#8217; journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God as He will command us.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>So Pharaoh said, &#8220;I will let you go, that you may sacrifice to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God in the wilderness; only you shall not go very far away. Intercede for me.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Then Moses said, &#8220;Indeed I am going out from you, and I will entreat the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, that the swarms <i>of flies</i> may depart tomorrow from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people. But let Pharaoh not deal deceitfully anymore in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>So Moses went out from Pharaoh and entreated the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> did according to the word of Moses; He removed the swarms <i>of flies</i> from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people. Not one remained. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>But Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also; neither would he let the people go.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-1718a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 8:7">Exodus 8:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>secret arts</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1719b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 8:8">Exodus 8:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Pray to, Make supplication to</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1727c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 8:16">Exodus 8:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>gnats</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1729d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 8:18">Exodus 8:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>secret arts</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1730e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 8:19">Exodus 8:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'>An act of God</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1734f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 8:23">Exodus 8:23</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>set a ransom,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Exod.9.4" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=Exod.9.4&amp;version=NKJV">Ex. 9:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Exod.11.7" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=Exod.11.7&amp;version=NKJV">11:7</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1737g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 8:26">Exodus 8:26</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Put us to death by stoning</span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
