<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/33-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And I will send <i>My</i> Angel before you, and I will drive out the Canaanite and the Amorite and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/33-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span><i>Go up</i> to a land flowing with milk and honey; for I will not go up in your midst, lest I <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>consume you on the way, for you <i>are</i> a stiff-necked<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span> people.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/33-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And when the people heard this bad news, they mourned, and no one put on his ornaments. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/33-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had said to Moses, &#8220;Say to the children of Israel, &#8216;You <i>are</i> a stiff-necked people. I could come up into your midst in one moment and consume you. Now therefore, take off your <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>ornaments, that I may know what to do to you.&#8217; &#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/33-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by Mount Horeb.</span></p> <h3>
Moses Meets with the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span></span></h3><p><span class="text Exod-33-7"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/33-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Moses took his tent and pitched it outside the camp, far from the camp, and called it the tabernacle of meeting. And it came to pass <i>that</i> everyone who sought the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> went out to the tabernacle of meeting which <i>was</i> outside the camp. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/33-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So it was, whenever Moses went out to the tabernacle, <i>that</i> all the people rose, and each man stood <i>at</i> his tent door and watched Moses until he had gone into the tabernacle. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/33-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And it came to pass, when Moses entered the tabernacle, that the pillar of cloud descended and stood <i>at</i> the door of the tabernacle, and <i>the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span></i> talked with Moses. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/33-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>All the people saw the pillar of cloud standing <i>at</i> the tabernacle door, and all the people rose and worshiped, each man <i>in</i> his tent door. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/33-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. And he would return to the camp, but his servant Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, did not depart from the tabernacle.</span></p> <h3>
The Promise of God&#8217;s Presence</span></h3><p><span class="text Exod-33-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/33-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then Moses said to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, &#8220;See, You say to me, &#8216;Bring up this people.&#8217; But You have not let me know whom You will send with me. Yet You have said, &#8216;I know you by name, and you have also found grace in My sight.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/33-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Now therefore, I pray, if I have found grace in Your sight, show me now Your way, that I may know You and that I may find grace in Your sight. And consider that this nation <i>is</i> Your people.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/33-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And He said, &#8220;My Presence will go <i>with you,</i> and I will give you rest.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/33-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then he said to Him, &#8220;If Your Presence does not go <i>with us,</i> do not bring us up from here. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/33-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>For how then will it be known that Your people and I have found grace in Your sight, except You go with us? So we shall be separate, Your people and I, from all the people who <i>are</i> upon the face of the earth.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/33-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;I will also do this thing that you have spoken; for you have found grace in My sight, and I know you by name.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/33-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;Please, show me Your glory.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/33-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then He said, &#8220;I will make all My goodness pass before you, and I will proclaim the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> before you. I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/33-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>But He said, &#8220;You cannot see My face; for no man shall see Me, and live.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/33-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said, &#8220;Here is a place by Me, and you shall stand on the rock. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/33-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So it shall be, while My glory passes by, that I will put you in the cleft of the rock, and will cover you with My hand while I pass by. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/33-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Then I will take away My hand, and you shall see My back; but My face shall not be seen.&#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-2477a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 33:3">Exodus 33:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>destroy</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-2477b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 33:3">Exodus 33:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>stubborn</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-2479c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 33:5">Exodus 33:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>jewelry</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
