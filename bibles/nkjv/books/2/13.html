<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Consecrate<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span> to Me all the firstborn, whatever opens the womb among the children of Israel, <i>both</i> of man and beast; it is Mine.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
The Feast of Unleavened Bread</span></h3><p><span class="text Exod-13-3"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And Moses said to the people: &#8220;Remember this day in which you went out of Egypt, out of the house of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>bondage; for by strength of hand the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> brought you out of this <i>place.</i> No leavened bread shall be eaten. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>On this day you are going out, in the month Abib. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And it shall be, when the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> brings you into the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Hivites and the Jebusites, which He swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, that you shall keep this service in this month. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/13-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day <i>there shall be</i> a feast to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/13-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days. And no leavened bread shall be seen among you, nor shall leaven be seen among you in all your quarters. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And you shall tell your son in that day, saying, &#8216;<i>This is done</i> because of what the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> did for me when I came up from Egypt.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/13-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>It shall be as a sign to you on your hand and as a memorial between your eyes, that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s law may be in your mouth; for with a strong hand the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has brought you out of Egypt. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/13-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>You shall therefore keep this <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>ordinance in its season from year to year.</span></p> <h3>
The Law of the Firstborn</span></h3><p><span class="text Exod-13-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8220;And it shall be, when the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> brings you into the land of the Canaanites, as He swore to you and your fathers, and gives it to you, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/13-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>that you shall <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>set apart to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> all that open the womb, that is, every firstborn that comes from an animal which you have; the males <i>shall be</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/13-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>But every firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb; and if you will not redeem <i>it,</i> then you shall break its neck. And all the firstborn of man among your sons you shall redeem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/13-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So it shall be, when your son asks you in time to come, saying, &#8216;What <i>is</i> this?&#8217; that you shall say to him, &#8216;By strength of hand the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> brought us out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/13-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And it came to pass, when Pharaoh was stubborn about letting us go, that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man and the firstborn of beast. Therefore I sacrifice to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> all males that open the womb, but all the firstborn of my sons I redeem.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/13-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>It shall be as a sign on your hand and as frontlets between your eyes, for by strength of hand the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> brought us out of Egypt.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
The Wilderness Way</span></h3><p><span class="text Exod-13-17"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/13-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God did not lead them <i>by</i> way of the land of the Philistines, although that <i>was</i> near; for God said, &#8220;Lest perhaps the people change their minds when they see war, and return to Egypt.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/13-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>So God led the people around <i>by</i> way of the wilderness of the Red Sea. And the children of Israel went up in orderly ranks out of the land of Egypt.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/13-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for he had placed the children of Israel under solemn oath, saying, &#8220;God will surely <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here with you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/13-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So they took their journey from Succoth and camped in Etham at the edge of the wilderness. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/13-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead the way, and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, so as to go by day and night. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/13-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>He did not take away the pillar of cloud by day or the pillar of fire by night <i>from</i> before the people.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-1870a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 13:2">Exodus 13:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Set apart</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1871b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 13:3">Exodus 13:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>slaves</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1878c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 13:10">Exodus 13:10</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>regulation</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1880d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 13:12">Exodus 13:12</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>cause to pass over</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1887e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 13:19">Exodus 13:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>give attention to</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
