<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to him, &#8220;What <i>is</i> that in your hand?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Exod-4-2">He said, &#8220;A rod.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And He said, &#8220;Cast it on the ground.&#8221; So he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;Reach out your hand and take <i>it</i> by the tail&#8221; (and he reached out his hand and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand), </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8220;that they may believe that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Furthermore the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to him, &#8220;Now put your hand in your bosom.&#8221; And he put his hand in his bosom, and when he took it out, behold, his hand <i>was</i> leprous, like snow. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And He said, &#8220;Put your hand in your bosom again.&#8221; So he put his hand in his bosom again, and drew it out of his bosom, and behold, it was restored like his <i>other</i> flesh. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8220;Then it will be, if they do not believe you, nor heed the message of the first sign, that they may believe the message of the latter sign. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And it shall be, if they do not believe even these two signs, or listen to your voice, that you shall take water from <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>the river and pour <i>it</i> on the dry <i>land.</i> The water which you take from the river will become blood on the dry <i>land.</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then Moses said to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, &#8220;O my Lord, I <i>am</i> not eloquent, neither before nor since You have spoken to Your servant; but I <i>am</i> slow of speech and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>slow of tongue.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to him, &#8220;Who has made man&#8217;s mouth? Or who makes the mute, the deaf, the seeing, or the blind? <i>Have</i> not I, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now therefore, go, and I will be with your mouth and teach you what you shall say.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>But he said, &#8220;O my Lord, please send by the hand of whomever <i>else</i> You may send.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So the anger of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was kindled against Moses, and He said: &#8220;Is not Aaron the Levite your brother? I know that he can speak well. And look, he is also coming out to meet you. When he sees you, he will be glad in his heart. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Now you shall speak to him and put the words in his mouth. And I will be with your mouth and with his mouth, and I will teach you what you shall do. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So he shall be your spokesman to the people. And he himself shall be as a mouth for you, and you shall be to him as God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And you shall take this rod in your hand, with which you shall do the signs.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Moses Goes to Egypt</span></h3><p><span class="text Exod-4-18"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>So Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said to him, &#8220;Please let me go and return to my brethren who <i>are</i> in Egypt, and see whether they are still alive.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Exod-4-18">And Jethro said to Moses, &#8220;Go in peace.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Now the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses in Midian, &#8220;Go, return to Egypt; for all the men who sought your life are dead.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then Moses took his wife and his sons and set them on a donkey, and he returned to the land of Egypt. And Moses took the rod of God in his hand.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;When you go back to Egypt, see that you do all those wonders before Pharaoh which I have put in your hand. But I will harden his heart, so that he will not let the people go. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then you shall say to Pharaoh, &#8216;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8220;Israel <i>is</i> My son, My firstborn. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>So I say to you, let My son go that he may serve Me. But if you refuse to let him go, indeed I will kill your son, your firstborn.&#8221; &#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And it came to pass on the way, at the encampment, that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> met him and sought to kill him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then Zipporah took a sharp stone and cut off the foreskin of her son and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>cast <i>it</i> at <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span><i>Moses&#8217;</i> feet, and said, &#8220;Surely you <i>are</i> a husband of blood to me!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>So He let him go. Then she said, &#8220;<i>You are</i> a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>husband of blood!&#8221;&#8212;because of the circumcision.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Aaron, &#8220;Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.&#8221; So he went and met him on the mountain of God, and kissed him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>So Moses told Aaron all the words of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> who had sent him, and all the signs which He had commanded him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Then Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And Aaron spoke all the words which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had spoken to Moses. Then he did the signs in the sight of the people. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>So the people believed; and when they heard that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had visited the children of Israel and that He had looked on their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshiped.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-1611a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 4:9">Exodus 4:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'>The Nile</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1612b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 4:10">Exodus 4:10</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>heavy</i> or <i>dull of tongue;</i> cannot talk very well</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1627c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 4:25">Exodus 4:25</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>made it touch</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1627d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 4:25">Exodus 4:25</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>his</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1628e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 4:26">Exodus 4:26</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>bridegroom</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
