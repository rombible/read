<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then Jethro, Moses&#8217; father-in-law, took Zipporah, Moses&#8217; wife, after he had sent her back, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>with her two sons, of whom the name of one <i>was</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>Gershom (for he said, &#8220;I have been a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>stranger in a foreign land&#8221;) </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and the name of the other <i>was</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Eliezer (for <i>he said,</i> &#8220;The God of my father <i>was</i> my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh&#8221;); </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and Jethro, Moses&#8217; father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses in the wilderness, where he was encamped at the mountain of God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now he had said to Moses, &#8220;I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons with her.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, bowed down, and kissed him. And they asked each other about <i>their</i> well-being, and they went into the tent. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And Moses told his father-in-law all that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel&#8217;s sake, all the hardship that had come upon them on the way, and <i>how</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had delivered them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then Jethro rejoiced for all the good which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had done for Israel, whom He had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And Jethro said, &#8220;Blessed <i>be</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of Pharaoh, <i>and</i> who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now I know that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>is</i> greater than all the gods; for in the very thing in which they <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>behaved proudly, <i>He was</i> above them.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then Jethro, Moses&#8217; father-in-law, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>took a burnt offering and <i>other</i> sacrifices <i>to offer</i> to God. And Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat bread with Moses&#8217; father-in-law before God.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And so it was, on the next day, that Moses sat to judge the people; and the people stood before Moses from morning until evening. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So when Moses&#8217; father-in-law saw all that he did for the people, he said, &#8220;What <i>is</i> this thing that you are doing for the people? Why do you alone <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>sit, and all the people stand before you from morning until evening?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And Moses said to his father-in-law, &#8220;Because the people come to me to inquire of God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>When they have a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>difficulty, they come to me, and I judge between one and another; and I make known the statutes of God and His laws.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So Moses&#8217; father-in-law said to him, &#8220;The thing that you do <i>is</i> not good. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Both you and these people who <i>are</i> with you will surely wear yourselves out. For this thing <i>is</i> too much for you; you are not able to perform it by yourself. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Listen now to my voice; I will give you <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>counsel, and God will be with you: Stand before God for the people, so that you may bring the difficulties to God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And you shall teach them the statutes and the laws, and show them the way in which they must walk and the work they must do. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Moreover you shall select from all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place <i>such</i> over them <i>to be</i> rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And let them judge the people at all times. Then it will be <i>that</i> every great matter they shall bring to you, but every small matter they themselves shall judge. So it will be easier for you, for they will bear <i>the burden</i> with you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>If you do this thing, and God <i>so</i> commands you, then you will be able to endure, and all this people will also go to their place in peace.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>So Moses heeded the voice of his father-in-law and did all that he had said. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people: rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>So they judged the people at all times; the hard<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span> cases they brought to Moses, but they judged every small case themselves.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Then Moses let his father-in-law depart, and he went his way to his own land.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-2003a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 18:3">Exodus 18:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Stranger There</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-2003b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 18:3">Exodus 18:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>sojourner,</i> temporary resident</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-2004c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 18:4">Exodus 18:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>My God Is Help</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-2011d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 18:11">Exodus 18:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>acted presumptuously</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-2012e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 18:12">Exodus 18:12</span> <span class='footnote-text'>So with MT, LXX; Syr., Tg., Vg. <i>offered</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-2014f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 18:14">Exodus 18:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Sit as judge</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-2016g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 18:16">Exodus 18:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>dispute</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-2019h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 18:19">Exodus 18:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>advice</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-2026i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 18:26">Exodus 18:26</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>difficult matters</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
