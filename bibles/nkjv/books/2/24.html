<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Moses alone shall come near the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, but they shall not come near; nor shall the people go up with him.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So Moses came and told the people all the words of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and all the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>judgments. And all the people answered with one voice and said, &#8220;All the words which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has said we will do.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And Moses wrote all the words of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. And he rose early in the morning, and built an altar at the foot of the mountain, and twelve pillars according to the twelve tribes of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then he sent young men of the children of Israel, who offered burnt offerings and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And Moses took half the blood and put <i>it</i> in basins, and half the blood he sprinkled on the altar. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then he took the Book of the Covenant and read in the hearing of the people. And they said, &#8220;All that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has said we will do, and be obedient.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And Moses took the blood, sprinkled <i>it</i> on the people, and said, &#8220;This is the blood of the covenant which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has made with you according to all these words.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
On the Mountain with God</span></h3><p><span class="text Exod-24-9"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then Moses went up, also Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and they saw the God of Israel. And <i>there was</i> under His feet as it were a paved work of sapphire stone, and it was like the very<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span> heavens in <i>its</i> clarity. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But on the nobles of the children of Israel He did not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>lay His hand. So they saw God, and they ate and drank.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;Come up to Me on the mountain and be there; and I will give you tablets of stone, and the law and commandments which I have written, that you may teach them.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So Moses arose with his assistant Joshua, and Moses went up to the mountain of God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And he said to the elders, &#8220;Wait here for us until we come back to you. Indeed, Aaron and Hur <i>are</i> with you. If any man has a difficulty, let him go to them.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then Moses went up into the mountain, and a cloud covered the mountain.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Now the glory of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> rested on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days. And on the seventh day He called to Moses out of the midst of the cloud. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>The sight of the glory of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>was</i> like a consuming fire on the top of the mountain in the eyes of the children of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>So Moses went into the midst of the cloud and went up into the mountain. And Moses was on the mountain forty days and forty nights.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-2181a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 24:3">Exodus 24:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>ordinances</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-2188b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 24:10">Exodus 24:10</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>substance of heaven</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-2189c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 24:11">Exodus 24:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>stretch out His</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
