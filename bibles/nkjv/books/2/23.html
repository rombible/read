Do not put your hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>You shall not follow a crowd to do evil; nor shall you testify in a dispute so as to turn aside after many to pervert <i>justice.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>You shall not show partiality to a poor man in his dispute.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8220;If you meet your enemy&#8217;s ox or his donkey going astray, you shall surely bring it back to him again. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>If you see the donkey of one who hates you lying under its burden, and you would refrain from helping it, you shall surely help him with it.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>&#8220;You shall not pervert the judgment of your poor in his dispute. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Keep yourself far from a false matter; do not kill the innocent and righteous. For I will not justify the wicked. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And you shall take no bribe, for a bribe blinds the discerning and perverts the words of the righteous.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;Also you shall not oppress a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>stranger, for you know the heart of a stranger, because you were strangers in the land of Egypt.</span></p> <h3>
The Law of Sabbaths</span></h3><p><span class="text Exod-23-10"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8220;Six years you shall sow your land and gather in its produce, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>but the seventh <i>year</i> you shall let it rest and lie fallow, that the poor of your people may eat; and what they leave, the beasts of the field may eat. In like manner you shall do with your vineyard <i>and</i> your <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>olive grove. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Six days you shall do your work, and on the seventh day you shall rest, that your ox and your donkey may rest, and the son of your female servant and the stranger may be refreshed.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8220;And in all that I have said to you, be circumspect and make no mention of the name of other gods, nor let it be heard from your mouth.</span></p> <h3>
Three Annual Feasts</span></h3><p><span class="text Exod-23-14"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>&#8220;Three times you shall keep a feast to Me in the year: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>You shall keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread (you shall eat unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded you, at the time appointed in the month of Abib, for in it you came out of Egypt; none shall appear before Me empty); </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>and the Feast of Harvest, the firstfruits of your labors which you have sown in the field; and the Feast of Ingathering at the end of the year, when you have gathered in <i>the fruit of</i> your labors from the field.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>&#8220;Three times in the year all your males shall appear before the Lord <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span><span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>&#8220;You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread; nor shall the fat of My <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>sacrifice remain until morning. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>The first of the firstfruits of your land you shall bring into the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God. You shall not boil a young goat in its mother&#8217;s milk.</span></p> <h3>
The Angel and the Promises</span></h3><p><span class="text Exod-23-20"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>&#8220;Behold, I send an Angel before you to keep you in the way and to bring you into the place which I have prepared. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Beware of Him and obey His voice; do not provoke Him, for He will not pardon your transgressions; for My name <i>is</i> in Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But if you indeed obey His voice and do all that I speak, then I will be an enemy to your enemies and an adversary to your adversaries. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>For My Angel will go before you and bring you in to the Amorites and the Hittites and the Perizzites and the Canaanites and the Hivites and the Jebusites; and I will <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>cut them off. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>You shall not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do according to their works; but you shall utterly overthrow them and completely break down their <i>sacred</i> pillars.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>&#8220;So you shall serve the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God, and He will bless your bread and your water. And I will take sickness away from the midst of you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>No one shall suffer miscarriage or be barren in your land; I will fulfill the number of your days.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>&#8220;I will send My fear before you, I will cause confusion among all the people to whom you come, and will make all your enemies turn <i>their</i> backs to you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And I will send hornets before you, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite from before you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>I will not drive them out from before you in one year, lest the land become desolate and the beasts of the field become too numerous for you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Little by little I will drive them out from before you, until you have increased, and you inherit the land. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>And I will set your <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>bounds from the Red Sea to the sea, Philistia, and from the desert to the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>River. For I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand, and you shall drive them out before you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>You shall make no <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>covenant with them, nor with their gods. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>They shall not dwell in your land, lest they make you sin against Me.
