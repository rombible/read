Making the Ephod</span></h3><p><span class="text Exod-39-2"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/39-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>He made the ephod of gold, blue, purple, and scarlet <i>thread,</i> and of fine woven linen. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/39-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And they beat the gold into thin sheets and cut <i>it into</i> threads, to work <i>it</i> in <i>with</i> the blue, purple, and scarlet <i>thread,</i> and the fine linen, <i>into</i> artistic designs. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/39-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>They made shoulder straps for it to couple <i>it</i> together; it was coupled together at its two edges. </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/39-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And they bound the breastplate by means of its rings to the rings of the ephod with a blue cord, so that it would be above the intricately woven band of the ephod, and that the breastplate would not come loose from the ephod, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had commanded Moses.</span></p> <h3>
Making the Other Priestly Garments</span></h3><p><span class="text Exod-39-22"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/39-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>He made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue. </span>
