<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Pharaoh said, &#8220;Who <i>is</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, that I should obey His voice to let Israel go? I do not know the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, nor will I let Israel go.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So they said, &#8220;The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please, let us go three days&#8217; journey into the desert and sacrifice to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God, lest He fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then the king of Egypt said to them, &#8220;Moses and Aaron, why do you take the people from their work? Get <i>back</i> to your labor.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And Pharaoh said, &#8220;Look, the people of the land <i>are</i> many now, and you make them rest from their labor!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So the same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their officers, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8220;You shall no longer give the people straw to make brick as before. Let them go and gather straw for themselves. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And you shall lay on them the quota of bricks which they made before. You shall not reduce it. For they are idle; therefore they cry out, saying, &#8216;Let us go <i>and</i> sacrifice to our God.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Let more work be laid on the men, that they may labor in it, and let them not regard false words.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And the taskmasters of the people and their officers went out and spoke to the people, saying, &#8220;Thus says Pharaoh: &#8216;I will not give you straw. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Go, get yourselves straw where you can find it; yet none of your work will be reduced.&#8217; &#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And the taskmasters forced <i>them</i> to hurry, saying, &#8220;Fulfill your work, <i>your</i> daily quota, as when there was straw.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Also the officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh&#8217;s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten <i>and</i> were asked, &#8220;Why have you not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and today, as before?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried out to Pharaoh, saying, &#8220;Why are you dealing thus with your servants? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>There is no straw given to your servants, and they say to us, &#8216;Make brick!&#8217; And indeed your servants <i>are</i> beaten, but the fault <i>is</i> in your <i>own</i> people.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But he said, &#8220;You <i>are</i> idle! Idle! Therefore you say, &#8216;Let us go <i>and</i> sacrifice to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Therefore go now <i>and</i> work; for no straw shall be given you, yet you shall deliver the quota of bricks.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And the officers of the children of Israel saw <i>that</i> they <i>were</i> in trouble after it was said, &#8220;You shall not reduce <i>any</i> bricks from your daily quota.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then, as they came out from Pharaoh, they met Moses and Aaron who stood there to meet them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And they said to them, &#8220;Let the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> look on you and judge, because you have made <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>us abhorrent in the sight of Pharaoh and in the sight of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to kill us.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Israel&#8217;s Deliverance Assured</span></h3><p><span class="text Exod-5-22"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So Moses returned to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and said, &#8220;Lord, why have You brought trouble on this people? Why <i>is</i> it You have sent me? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, he has done evil to this people; neither have You delivered Your people at all.&#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-1634a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 5:1">Exodus 5:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>keep a pilgrim-feast</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1654b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 5:21">Exodus 5:21</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>our scent to stink before</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
