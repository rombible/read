<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then the whole congregation of the children of Israel complained against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And the children of Israel said to them, &#8220;Oh, that we had died by the hand of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the pots of meat <i>and</i> when we ate bread to the full! For you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you. And the people shall go out and gather <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>a certain quota every day, that I may test them, whether they will walk in My law or not. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And it shall be on the sixth day that they shall prepare what they bring in, and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel, &#8220;At evening you shall know that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has brought you out of the land of Egypt. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And in the morning you shall see the glory of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; for He hears your complaints against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. But what <i>are</i> we, that you complain against us?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Also Moses said, &#8220;<i>This shall be seen</i> when the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> gives you meat to eat in the evening, and in the morning bread to the full; for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> hears your complaints which you make against Him. And what <i>are</i> we? Your complaints <i>are</i> not against us but against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then Moses spoke to Aaron, &#8220;Say to all the congregation of the children of Israel, &#8216;Come near before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, for He has heard your complaints.&#8217; &#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Now it came to pass, as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> appeared in the cloud.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>&#8220;I have heard the complaints of the children of Israel. Speak to them, saying, &#8216;At twilight you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread. And you shall know that I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So it was that quail came up at evening and covered the camp, and in the morning the dew lay all around the camp. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And when the layer of dew lifted, there, on the surface of the wilderness, was a small round substance, <i>as</i> fine as frost on the ground. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So when the children of Israel saw <i>it,</i> they said to one another, &#8220;What is it?&#8221; For they did not know what it <i>was.</i></span></p><p><span class="text Exod-16-15">And Moses said to them, &#8220;This <i>is</i> the bread which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has given you to eat. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>This is the thing which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has commanded: &#8216;Let every man gather it according to each one&#8217;s need, one omer for each person, <i>according to the</i> number of persons; let every man take for <i>those</i> who <i>are</i> in his tent.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then the children of Israel did so and gathered, some more, some less. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>So when they measured <i>it</i> by omers, he who gathered much had nothing left over, and he who gathered little had no lack. Every man had gathered according to each one&#8217;s need. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And Moses said, &#8220;Let no one leave any of it till morning.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Notwithstanding they did not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>heed Moses. But some of them left part of it until morning, and it bred worms and stank. And Moses was angry with them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>So they gathered it every morning, every man according to his need. And when the sun became hot, it melted.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And so it was, on the sixth day, <i>that</i> they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one. And all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Then he said to them, &#8220;This <i>is what</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has said: &#8216;Tomorrow <i>is</i> a Sabbath rest, a holy Sabbath to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. Bake what you will bake <i>today,</i> and boil what you will boil; and lay up for yourselves all that remains, to be kept until morning.&#8217; &#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>So they laid it up till morning, as Moses commanded; and it did not stink, nor were there any worms in it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then Moses said, &#8220;Eat that today, for today <i>is</i> a Sabbath to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; today you will not find it in the field. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will be none.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Now it happened <i>that some</i> of the people went out on the seventh day to gather, but they found none. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;How long do you refuse to keep My commandments and My laws? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>See! For the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has given you the Sabbath; therefore He gives you on the sixth day bread for two days. Let every man remain in his place; let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>So the people rested on the seventh day.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>And the house of Israel called its name <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Manna. And it <i>was</i> like white coriander seed, and the taste of it <i>was</i> like wafers <i>made</i> with honey.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Then Moses said, &#8220;This <i>is</i> the thing which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has commanded: &#8216;Fill an omer with it, to be kept for your generations, that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.&#8217; &#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And Moses said to Aaron, &#8220;Take a pot and put an omer of manna in it, and lay it up before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, to be kept for your generations.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>As the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>And the children of Israel ate manna forty years, until they came to an inhabited land; they ate manna until they came to the border of the land of Canaan. </span>
