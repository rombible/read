<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and present yourself to Me there on the top of the mountain. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And no man shall come up with you, and let no man be seen throughout all the mountain; let neither flocks nor herds feed before that mountain.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So he cut two tablets of stone like the first <i>ones.</i> Then Moses rose early in the morning and went up Mount Sinai, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had commanded him; and he took in his hand the two tablets of stone.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> descended in the cloud and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> passed before him and proclaimed, &#8220;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abounding in goodness and truth, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, by no means clearing <i>the guilty,</i> visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and the children&#8217;s children to the third and the fourth generation.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So Moses made haste and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshiped. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then he said, &#8220;If now I have found grace in Your sight, O Lord, let my Lord, I pray, go among us, even though we <i>are</i> a stiff-necked<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span> people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us as Your inheritance.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
The Covenant Renewed</span></h3><p><span class="text Exod-34-10"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And He said: &#8220;Behold, I make a covenant.

For it <i>is</i> an awesome thing that I will do with you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Observe what I command you this day. Behold, I am driving out from before you the Amorite and the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Take heed to yourself, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you are going, lest it be a snare in your midst. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>But you shall destroy their altars, break their <i>sacred</i> pillars, and cut down their wooden images </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>(for you shall worship no other god, for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, whose name <i>is</i> Jealous, <i>is</i> a jealous God), </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they play the harlot with their gods and make sacrifice to their gods, and <i>one of them</i> invites you and you eat of his sacrifice, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>and you take of his daughters for your sons, and his daughters play the harlot with their gods and make your sons play the harlot with their gods.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>&#8220;You shall make no molded gods for yourselves.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>&#8220;The Feast of Unleavened Bread you shall keep. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, in the appointed time of the month of Abib; for in the month of Abib you came out from Egypt.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>&#8220;All <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>that open the womb <i>are</i> Mine, and every male firstborn among your livestock, <i>whether</i> ox or sheep. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>But the firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>&#8220;Six days you shall work, but on the seventh day you shall rest; in plowing time and in harvest you shall rest.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>&#8220;And you shall observe the Feast of Weeks, of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the Feast of Ingathering at the year&#8217;s end.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>&#8220;Three times in the year all your men shall appear before the Lord, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>For I will cast out the nations before you and enlarge your borders; neither will any man covet your land when you go up to appear before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God three times in the year.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>&#8220;You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leaven, nor shall the sacrifice of the Feast of the Passover be left until morning.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>&#8220;The first of the firstfruits of your land you shall bring to the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;Write these words, for according to the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>So he was there with the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> forty days and forty nights; he neither ate bread nor drank water.

The Shining Face of Moses</span></h3><p><span class="text Exod-34-29"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Now it was so, when Moses came down from Mount Sinai (and the two tablets of the Testimony <i>were</i> in Moses&#8217; hand when he came down from the mountain), that Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone while he talked with Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>So when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone, and they were afraid to come near him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Then Moses called to them, and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned to him; and Moses talked with them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Afterward all the children of Israel came near, and he gave them as commandments all that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had spoken with him on Mount Sinai. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And when Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil on his face. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>But whenever Moses went in before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> to speak with Him, he would take the veil off until he came out; and he would come out and speak to the children of Israel whatever he had been commanded. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>And whenever the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses&#8217; face shone, then Moses would put the veil on his face again, until he went in to speak with Him.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-2506a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 34:9">Exodus 34:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>stubborn</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-2507b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 34:10">Exodus 34:10</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>wonderful acts</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-2516c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 34:19">Exodus 34:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>the firstborn</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-2525d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 34:28">Exodus 34:28</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Ten Words</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
