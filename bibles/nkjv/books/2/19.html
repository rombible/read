<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>For they had departed from Rephidim, had come <i>to</i> the Wilderness of Sinai, and camped in the wilderness. So Israel camped there before the mountain.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And Moses went up to God, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> called to him from the mountain, saying, &#8220;Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8216;You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and <i>how</i> I <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>bore you on eagles&#8217; wings and brought you to Myself. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now therefore, if you will indeed obey My voice and keep My covenant, then you shall be a special treasure to Me above all people; for all the earth <i>is</i> Mine. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.&#8217; These <i>are</i> the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>laid before them all these words which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> commanded him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then all the people answered together and said, &#8220;All that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has spoken we will do.&#8221; So Moses brought back the words of the people to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;Behold, I come to you in the thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and believe you forever.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Exod-19-9">So Moses told the words of the people to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their clothes. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And let them be ready for the third day. For on the third day the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will come down upon Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>You shall set bounds for the people all around, saying, &#8216;Take heed to yourselves <i>that</i> you do <i>not</i> go up to the mountain or touch its base. Whoever touches the mountain shall surely be put to death. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Not a hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned or shot <i>with an arrow;</i> whether man or beast, he shall not live.&#8217; When the trumpet sounds long, they shall come near the mountain.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So Moses went down from the mountain to the people and sanctified the people, and they washed their clothes. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And he said to the people, &#8220;Be ready for the third day; do not come near <i>your</i> wives.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then it came to pass on the third day, in the morning, that there were thunderings and lightnings, and a thick cloud on the mountain; and the sound of the trumpet was very loud, so that all the people who <i>were</i> in the camp trembled. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet with God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Now Mount Sinai <i>was</i> completely in smoke, because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> descended upon it in fire. Its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace, and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>the whole mountain quaked greatly. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And when the blast of the trumpet sounded long and became louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by voice. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came down upon Mount Sinai, on the top of the mountain. And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;Go down and warn the people, lest they break through to gaze at the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and many of them perish. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Also let the priests who come near the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> consecrate themselves, lest the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> break out against them.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>But Moses said to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, &#8220;The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai; for You warned us, saying, &#8216;Set bounds around the mountain and consecrate it.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to him, &#8220;Away! Get down and then come up, you and Aaron with you. But do not let the priests and the people break through to come up to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, lest He break out against them.&#8221; </span>
