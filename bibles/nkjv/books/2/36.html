The People Give More than Enough</span></h3><p><span class="text Exod-36-2"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then Moses called Bezalel and Aholiab, and every gifted artisan in whose heart the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had put wisdom, everyone whose heart <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>was stirred, to come and do the work. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And they received from Moses all the offering which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of making the sanctuary. So they continued bringing to him freewill offerings every morning. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then all the craftsmen who were doing all the work of the sanctuary came, each from the work he was doing, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and they spoke to Moses, saying, &#8220;The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> commanded <i>us</i> to do.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So Moses gave a commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, &#8220;Let neither man nor woman do any more work for the offering of the sanctuary.&#8221; And the people were restrained from bringing, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>for the material they had was sufficient for all the work to be done&#8212;indeed too much.</span></p> <h3>
Building the Tabernacle</span></h3><p><span class="text Exod-36-8"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then all the gifted artisans among them who worked on the tabernacle made ten curtains woven of fine linen, and of blue, purple, and scarlet <i>thread; with</i> artistic designs of cherubim they made them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>The length of each curtain <i>was</i> twenty-eight cubits, and the width of each curtain four cubits; the curtains <i>were</i> all the same size. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And he coupled five curtains to one another, and <i>the other</i> five curtains he coupled to one another. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>He made loops of blue <i>yarn</i> on the edge of the curtain on the selvedge of one set; likewise he did on the outer edge of <i>the other</i> curtain of the second set. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Fifty loops he made on one curtain, and fifty loops he made on the edge of the curtain on the end of the second set; the loops held one <i>curtain</i> to another. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And he made fifty clasps of gold, and coupled the curtains to one another with the clasps, that it might be one tabernacle.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>He made curtains of goats&#8217; <i>hair</i> for the tent over the tabernacle; he made eleven curtains. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>The length of each curtain <i>was</i> thirty cubits, and the width of each curtain four cubits; the eleven curtains <i>were</i> the same size. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>He coupled five curtains by themselves and six curtains by themselves. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that is outermost in one set, and fifty loops he made on the edge of the curtain of the second set. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>He also made fifty bronze clasps to couple the tent together, that it might be one. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then he made a covering for the tent of ram skins dyed red, and a covering of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>badger skins above <i>that.</i></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>For the tabernacle he made boards of acacia wood, standing upright. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>The length of each board <i>was</i> ten cubits, and the width of each board a cubit and a half. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Each board had two <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>tenons for binding one to another. Thus he made for all the boards of the tabernacle. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And he made boards for the tabernacle, twenty boards for the south side. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Forty sockets of silver he made to go under the twenty boards: two sockets under each of the boards for its two tenons. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And for the other side of the tabernacle, the north side, he made twenty boards </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>and their forty sockets of silver: two sockets under each of the boards. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>For the west side of the tabernacle he made six boards. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>He also made two boards for the two back corners of the tabernacle. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And they were coupled at the bottom and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>coupled together at the top by one ring. Thus he made both of them for the two corners. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>So there were eight boards and their sockets&#8212;sixteen sockets of silver&#8212;two sockets under each of the boards.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>And he made bars of acacia wood: five for the boards on one side of the tabernacle, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>five bars for the boards on the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle on the far side westward. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And he made the middle bar to pass through the boards from one end to the other. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>He overlaid the boards with gold, made their rings of gold <i>to be</i> holders for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>And he made a veil of blue, purple, and scarlet <i>thread,</i> and fine woven linen; it was worked <i>with</i> an artistic design of cherubim. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>He made for it four pillars of acacia <i>wood,</i> and overlaid them with gold, with their hooks of gold; and he cast four sockets of silver for them.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>He also made a screen for the tabernacle door, of blue, purple, and scarlet <i>thread,</i> and fine woven linen, made by a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>weaver, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>and its five pillars with their hooks.
