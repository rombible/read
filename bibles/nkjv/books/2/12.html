<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;This month <i>shall be</i> your beginning of months; it <i>shall be</i> the first month of the year to you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Speak to all the congregation of Israel, saying: &#8216;On the tenth of this month every man shall take for himself a lamb, according to the house of <i>his</i> father, a lamb for a household. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And if the household is too small for the lamb, let him and his neighbor next to his house take <i>it</i> according to the number of the persons; according to each man&#8217;s need you shall make your count for the lamb. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Your lamb shall be without<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span> blemish, a male <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>of the first year. You may take <i>it</i> from the sheep or from the goats. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month. Then the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it at twilight. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And they shall take <i>some</i> of the blood and put <i>it</i> on the two doorposts and on the lintel of the houses where they eat it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then they shall eat the flesh on that night; roasted in fire, with unleavened bread <i>and</i> with bitter <i>herbs</i> they shall eat it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Do not eat it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roasted in fire&#8212;its head with its legs and its entrails. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>You shall let none of it remain until morning, and what remains of it until morning you shall burn with fire. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And thus you shall eat it: <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span><i>with</i> a belt on your waist, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand. So you shall eat it in haste. It <i>is</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s Passover.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>&#8216;For I will pass through the land of Egypt on that night, and will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Now the blood shall be a sign for you on the houses where you <i>are.</i> And when I see the blood, I will pass over you; and the plague shall not be on you to destroy <i>you</i> when I strike the land of Egypt.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>&#8216;So this day shall be to you a memorial; and you shall keep it as a feast to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> throughout your generations. You shall keep it as a feast by an everlasting ordinance. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread. On the first day you shall remove leaven from your houses. For whoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>person shall be <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>cut off from Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>On the first day <i>there shall be</i> a holy convocation, and on the seventh day there shall be a holy convocation for you.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So you shall observe <i>the Feast of</i> Unleavened Bread, for on this same day I will have brought your <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>armies out of the land of Egypt. Therefore you shall observe this day throughout your generations as an everlasting ordinance. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>In the first <i>month,</i> on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, you shall eat unleavened bread, until the twenty-first day of the month at evening. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>For seven days no leaven shall be found in your houses, since whoever eats what is leavened, that same person shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether <i>he is</i> a stranger or a native of the land. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>You shall eat nothing leavened; in all your dwellings you shall eat unleavened bread.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel and said to them, &#8220;Pick out and take lambs for yourselves according to your families, and kill the Passover <i>lamb.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And you shall take a bunch of hyssop, dip <i>it</i> in the blood that <i>is</i> in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two doorposts with the blood that <i>is</i> in the basin. And none of you shall go out of the door of his house until morning. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>For the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will pass through to strike the Egyptians; and when He sees the blood on the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>lintel and on the two doorposts, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will pass over the door and not allow the destroyer to come into your houses to strike <i>you.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And you shall observe this thing as an ordinance for you and your sons forever. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>It will come to pass when you come to the land which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will give you, just as He promised, that you shall keep this service. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And it shall be, when your children say to you, &#8216;What do you mean by this service?&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>that you shall say, &#8216;It <i>is</i> the Passover sacrifice of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt when He struck the Egyptians and delivered our households.&#8217; &#8221; So the people bowed their heads and worshiped. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then the children of Israel went away and did <i>so;</i> just as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.</span></p> <h3>
The Tenth Plague: Death of the Firstborn</span></h3><p><span class="text Exod-12-29"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And it came to pass at midnight that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who <i>was</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>in the dungeon, and all the firstborn of livestock. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>So Pharaoh rose in the night, he, all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt, for <i>there was</i> not a house where <i>there was</i> not one dead.</span></p> <h3>
The Exodus</span></h3><p><span class="text Exod-12-31"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Then he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, &#8220;Rise, go out from among my people, both you and the children of Israel. And go, serve the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> as you have said. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Also take your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and be gone; and bless me also.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And the Egyptians urged the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste. For they said, &#8220;We <i>shall</i> all <i>be</i> dead.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>So the people took their dough before it was leavened, having their kneading bowls bound up in their clothes on their shoulders. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Now the children of Israel had done according to the word of Moses, and they had asked from the Egyptians articles of silver, articles of gold, and clothing. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had given the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they granted them <i>what they requested.</i> Thus they plundered the Egyptians.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>Then the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides children. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>A mixed multitude went up with them also, and flocks and herds&#8212;a great deal of livestock. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they had brought out of Egypt; for it was not leavened, because they were driven out of Egypt and could not wait, nor had they prepared provisions for themselves.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>Now the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>sojourn of the children of Israel who lived in <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>Egypt <i>was</i> four hundred and thirty years. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years&#8212;on that very same day&#8212;it came to pass that all the armies of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> went out from the land of Egypt. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>It <i>is</i> a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span>night of solemn observance to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> for bringing them out of the land of Egypt. This <i>is</i> that night of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, a solemn observance for all the children of Israel throughout their generations.</span></p> <h3>
Passover Regulations</span></h3><p><span class="text Exod-12-43"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses and Aaron, &#8220;This <i>is</i> the ordinance of the Passover: No foreigner shall eat it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>But every man&#8217;s servant who is bought for money, when you have circumcised him, then he may eat it. </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-47.htm"><b>47</b></a></span>All the congregation of Israel shall keep it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-48.htm"><b>48</b></a></span>And when a stranger <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[l]</a></span>dwells with you <i>and wants</i> to keep the Passover to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as a native of the land.
