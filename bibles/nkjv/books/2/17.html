<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/17-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Therefore the people contended with Moses, and said, &#8220;Give us water, that we may drink.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Exod-17-2">So Moses said to them, &#8220;Why do you contend with me? Why do you tempt the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/17-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And the people thirsted there for water, and the people complained against Moses, and said, &#8220;Why <i>is</i> it you have brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/17-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So Moses cried out to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, saying, &#8220;What shall I do with this people? They are almost ready to stone<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span> me!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/17-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;Go on before the people, and take with you some of the elders of Israel. Also take in your hand your rod with which you struck the river, and go. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/17-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock in Horeb; and you shall strike the rock, and water will come out of it, that the people may drink.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Exod-17-6">And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/17-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So he called the name of the place Massah<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span> and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Meribah, because of the contention of the children of Israel, and because they <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>tempted the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, saying, &#8220;Is the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> among us or not?&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Victory over the Amalekites</span></h3><p><span class="text Exod-17-8"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/17-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Now Amalek came and fought with Israel in Rephidim. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/17-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And Moses said to Joshua, &#8220;Choose us some men and go out, fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/17-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So Joshua did as Moses said to him, and fought with Amalek. And Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/17-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And so it was, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed; and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/17-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But Moses&#8217; hands <i>became</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>heavy; so they took a stone and put <i>it</i> under him, and he sat on it. And Aaron and Hur supported his hands, one on one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/17-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So Joshua defeated Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/17-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;Write this <i>for</i> a memorial in the book and recount <i>it</i> in the hearing of Joshua, that I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/17-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And Moses built an altar and called its name, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>The-<span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>-Is-My-Banner; </span>
