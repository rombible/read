And he led the flock to the back of the desert, and came to Horeb, the mountain of God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And the Angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> appeared to him in a flame of fire from the midst of a bush. So he looked, and behold, the bush was burning with fire, but the bush <i>was</i> not consumed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then Moses said, &#8220;I will now turn aside and see this great sight, why the bush does not burn.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So when the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> saw that he turned aside to look, God called to him from the midst of the bush and said, &#8220;Moses, Moses!&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Exod-3-4">And he said, &#8220;Here I am.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then He said, &#8220;Do not draw near this place. Take your sandals off your feet, for the place where you stand <i>is</i> holy ground.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Moreover He said, &#8220;I <i>am</i> the God of your father&#8212;the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.&#8221; And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said: &#8220;I have surely seen the oppression of My people who <i>are</i> in Egypt, and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters, for I know their <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>sorrows. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up from that land to a good and large land, to a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel has come to Me, and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Come now, therefore, and I will send you to Pharaoh that you may bring My people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But Moses said to God, &#8220;Who <i>am</i> I that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So He said, &#8220;I will certainly be with you. And this <i>shall be</i> a sign to you that I have sent you: When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then Moses said to God, &#8220;Indeed, <i>when</i> I come to the children of Israel and say to them, &#8216;The God of your fathers has sent me to you,&#8217; and they say to me, &#8216;What <i>is</i> His name?&#8217; what shall I say to them?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And God said to Moses, &#8220;I AM WHO I AM.&#8221; And He said, &#8220;Thus you shall say to the children of Israel, &#8216;I AM has sent me to you.&#8217; &#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Moreover God said to Moses, &#8220;Thus you shall say to the children of Israel: &#8216;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you. This <i>is</i> My name forever, and this <i>is</i> My memorial to all generations.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Go and gather the elders of Israel together, and say to them, &#8216;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared to me, saying, &#8220;I have surely visited you and <i>seen</i> what is done to you in Egypt; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>and I have said I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites, to a land flowing with milk and honey.&#8221; &#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then they will heed your voice; and you shall come, you and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt; and you shall say to him, &#8216;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of the Hebrews has met with us; and now, please, let us go three days&#8217; journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>But I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not even by a mighty hand. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So I will stretch out My hand and strike Egypt with all My wonders which I will do in its midst; and after that he will let you go. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians; and it shall be, when you go, that you shall not go empty-handed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But every woman shall ask of her neighbor, namely, of her who dwells near her house, articles of silver, articles of gold, and clothing; and you shall put <i>them</i> on your sons and on your daughters. So you shall plunder the Egyptians.&#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-1587a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 3:7">Exodus 3:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>pain</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
