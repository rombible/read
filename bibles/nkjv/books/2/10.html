<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and that you may tell in the hearing of your son and your son&#8217;s son the mighty things I have done in Egypt, and My signs which I have done among them, that you may know that I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So Moses and Aaron came in to Pharaoh and said to him, &#8220;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of the Hebrews: &#8216;How long will you refuse to humble yourself before Me? Let My people go, that they may serve Me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Or else, if you refuse to let My people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your territory. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And they shall cover the face of the earth, so that no one will be able to see the earth; and they shall eat the residue of what is left, which remains to you from the hail, and they shall eat every tree which grows up for you out of the field. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>They shall fill your houses, the houses of all your servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians&#8212;which neither your fathers nor your fathers&#8217; fathers have seen, since the day that they were on the earth to this day.&#8217; &#8221; And he turned and went out from Pharaoh.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then Pharaoh&#8217;s servants said to him, &#8220;How long shall this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, that they may serve the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> their God. Do you not yet know that Egypt is destroyed?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh, and he said to them, &#8220;Go, serve the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God. Who <i>are</i> the ones that are going?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And Moses said, &#8220;We will go with our young and our old; with our sons and our daughters, with our flocks and our herds we will go, for we must hold a feast to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then he said to them, &#8220;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had better be with you when I let you and your little ones go! Beware, for evil is ahead of you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Not so! Go now, you <i>who are</i> men, and serve the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, for that is what you desired.&#8221; And they were driven out from Pharaoh&#8217;s presence.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land&#8212;all that the hail has left.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So Moses stretched out his rod over the land of Egypt, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> brought an east wind on the land all that day and all <i>that</i> night. When it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt and rested on all the territory of Egypt. <i>They were</i> very severe; previously there had been no such locusts as they, nor shall there be such after them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they ate every herb of the land and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left. So there remained nothing green on the trees or on the plants of the field throughout all the land of Egypt.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste, and said, &#8220;I have sinned against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God and against you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Now therefore, please forgive my sin only this once, and entreat<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God, that He may take away from me this death only.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>So he went out from Pharaoh and entreated the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> turned a very strong west wind, which took the locusts away and blew them into the Red Sea. There remained not one locust in all the territory of Egypt. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>But the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> hardened Pharaoh&#8217;s heart, and he did not let the children of Israel go.</span></p> <h3>
The Ninth Plague: Darkness</span></h3><p><span class="text Exod-10-21"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;Stretch out your hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>darkness <i>which</i> may even be felt.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So Moses stretched out his hand toward heaven, and there was thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>They did not see one another; nor did anyone rise from his place for three days. But all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then Pharaoh called to Moses and said, &#8220;Go, serve the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; only let your flocks and your herds be kept back. Let your little ones also go with you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>But Moses said, &#8220;You must also give <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>us sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Our livestock also shall go with us; not a hoof shall be left behind. For we must take some of them to serve the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God, and even we do not know with what we must serve the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> until we arrive there.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>But the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> hardened Pharaoh&#8217;s heart, and he would not let them go. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then Pharaoh said to him, &#8220;Get away from me! Take heed to yourself and see my face no more! For in the day you see my face you shall die!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>So Moses said, &#8220;You have spoken well.
