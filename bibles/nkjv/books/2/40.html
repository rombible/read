<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;On the first day of the first month you shall set up the tabernacle of the tent of meeting. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>You shall put in it the ark of the Testimony, and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>partition off the ark with the veil. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>You shall bring in the table and arrange the things that are to be set in order on it; and you shall bring in the lampstand and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>light its lamps. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>You shall also set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the Testimony, and put up the screen for the door of the tabernacle. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then you shall set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And you shall set the laver between the tabernacle of meeting and the altar, and put water in it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>You shall set up the court all around, and hang up the screen at the court gate.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;And you shall take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle and all that <i>is</i> in it; and you shall hallow it and all its utensils, and it shall be holy. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>You shall anoint the altar of the burnt offering and all its utensils, and consecrate the altar. The altar shall be most holy. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And you shall anoint the laver and its base, and consecrate it.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>&#8220;Then you shall bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tabernacle of meeting and wash them with water. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>You shall put the holy garments on Aaron, and anoint him and consecrate him, that he may minister to Me as priest. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And you shall bring his sons and clothe them with tunics. </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Thus Moses did; according to all that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had commanded him, so he did.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And it came to pass in the first month of the second year, on the first <i>day</i> of the month, <i>that</i> the tabernacle was <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>raised up. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>So Moses raised up the tabernacle, fastened its sockets, set up its boards, put in its bars, and raised up its pillars. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And he spread out the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering of the tent on top of it, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had commanded Moses. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>He took the Testimony and put <i>it</i> into the ark, inserted the poles through the rings of the ark, and put the mercy seat on top of the ark. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, hung up the veil of the covering, and partitioned off the ark of the Testimony, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had commanded Moses.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>He put the table in the tabernacle of meeting, on the north side of the tabernacle, outside the veil; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>and he set the bread in order upon it before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had commanded Moses. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>He put the lampstand in the tabernacle of meeting, across from the table, on the south side of the tabernacle; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>and he lit the lamps before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had commanded Moses. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>He put the gold altar in the tabernacle of meeting in front of the veil; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>and he burned sweet incense on it, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had commanded Moses. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>He hung up the screen <i>at</i> the door of the tabernacle. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And he put the altar of burnt offering <i>before</i> the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the grain offering, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had commanded Moses. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>He set the laver between the tabernacle of meeting and the altar, and put water there for washing; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>and Moses, Aaron, and his sons would wash their hands and their feet <i>with water</i> from it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Whenever they went into the tabernacle of meeting, and when they came near the altar, they washed, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had commanded Moses. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And he raised up the court all around the tabernacle and the altar, and hung up the screen of the court gate. So Moses finished the work.</span></p> <h3>
The Cloud and the Glory</span></h3><p><span class="text Exod-40-34"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Then the cloud covered the tabernacle of meeting, and the glory of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> filled the tabernacle. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>And Moses was not able to enter the tabernacle of meeting, because the cloud rested above it, and the glory of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> filled the tabernacle. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Whenever the cloud was taken up from above the tabernacle, the children of Israel would <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>go onward in all their journeys. </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>For the cloud of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>was</i> above the tabernacle by day, and fire was over it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-2711a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 40:3">Exodus 40:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>screen</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-2712b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 40:4">Exodus 40:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>set up</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-2725c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 40:17">Exodus 40:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>erected</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-2744d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Exodus 40:36">Exodus 40:36</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>journey</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
