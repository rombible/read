<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8216;And it shall be, when he is guilty in any of these <i>matters</i>, that he shall confess that he has sinned in that <i>thing;</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and he shall bring his trespass offering to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> for his sin which he has committed, a female from the flock, a lamb or a kid of the goats as a sin offering.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8216;If he is not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, for his trespass which he has committed, two turtledoves or two young pigeons: one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And he shall bring them to the priest, who shall offer <i>that</i> which <i>is</i> for the sin offering first, and wring off its head from its neck, but shall not divide <i>it</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>completely. </span>
