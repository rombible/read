<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So fire went out from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and devoured them, and they died before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And Moses said to Aaron, &#8220;This is what the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> spoke, saying:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Lev-10-3">&#8216;By those who come near Me</span><br /><span class="text Lev-10-3">I must be regarded as holy;</span><br /><span class="text Lev-10-3">And before all the people</span><br /><span class="text Lev-10-3">I must be glorified.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p></div><p class="first-line-none top-1"><span class="text Lev-10-3">So Aaron held his peace.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, &#8220;Come near, carry your brethren from <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>before the sanctuary out of the camp.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So they went near and carried them by their tunics out of the camp, as Moses had said.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and Ithamar, his sons, &#8220;Do not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>uncover your heads nor tear your clothes, lest you die, and wrath come upon all the people. But let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>bewail the burning which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has kindled. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>You shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of meeting, lest you die, for the anointing oil of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>is</i> upon you.&#8221; And they did according to the word of Moses.</span></p> <h3>
Conduct Prescribed for Priests</span></h3><p><span class="text Lev-10-8"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Aaron, saying: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;Do not drink wine or intoxicating drink, you, nor your sons with you, when you go into the tabernacle of meeting, lest you die. <i>It shall be</i> a statute forever throughout your generations, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>that you may distinguish between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>and that you may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has spoken to them by the hand of Moses.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And Moses spoke to Aaron, and to Eleazar and Ithamar, his sons who were left: &#8220;Take the grain offering that remains of the offerings made by fire to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and eat it without leaven beside the altar; for it <i>is</i> most holy. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>You shall eat it in a holy place, because it <i>is</i> your <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>due and your sons&#8217; due, of the sacrifices made by fire to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; for so I have been commanded. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>The breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the heave offering you shall eat in a clean place, you, your sons, and your daughters with you; for <i>they are</i> your due and your sons&#8217; due, <i>which</i> are given from the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>The thigh of the heave offering and the breast of the wave offering they shall bring with the offerings of fat made by fire, to offer <i>as</i> a wave offering before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then Moses made careful inquiry about the goat of the sin offering, and there it was&#8212;burned up. And he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron <i>who were</i> left, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>&#8220;Why have you not eaten the sin offering in a holy place, since it <i>is</i> most holy, and <i>God</i> has given it to you to bear the guilt of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>See! Its blood was not brought inside <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>the holy <i>place;</i> indeed you should have eaten it in a holy <i>place,</i> as I commanded.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
