<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, the anointing oil, a bull as the sin offering, two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and gather all the congregation together at the door of the tabernacle of meeting.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So Moses did as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> commanded him. And the congregation was gathered together at the door of the tabernacle of meeting. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And Moses said to the congregation, &#8220;This <i>is</i> what the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> commanded to be done.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then Moses brought Aaron and his sons and washed them with water. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And he put the tunic on him, girded him with the sash, clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod on him; and he girded him with the intricately woven band of the ephod, and with it tied <i>the ephod</i> on him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then he put the breastplate on him, and he put the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>Urim and the Thummim in the breastplate. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And he put the turban on his head. Also on the turban, on its front, he put the golden plate, the holy crown, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had commanded Moses.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Also Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that <i>was</i> in it, and consecrated them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>He sprinkled some of it on the altar seven times, anointed the altar and all its utensils, and the laver and its base, to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>consecrate them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And he poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron&#8217;s head and anointed him, to consecrate him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then Moses brought Aaron&#8217;s sons and put tunics on them, girded them with sashes, and put <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>hats on them, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had commanded Moses.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And he brought the bull for the sin offering. Then Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull for the sin offering, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and Moses killed <i>it</i>. Then he took the blood, and put <i>some</i> on the horns of the altar all around with his finger, and purified the altar. And he poured the blood at the base of the altar, and consecrated it, to make <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>atonement for it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then he took all the fat that <i>was</i> on the entrails, the fatty lobe <i>attached to</i> the liver, and the two kidneys with their fat, and Moses burned <i>them</i> on the altar. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But the bull, its hide, its flesh, and its offal, he burned with fire outside the camp, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had commanded Moses.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then he brought the ram as the burnt offering. And Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>and Moses killed <i>it.</i> Then he sprinkled the blood all around on the altar. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burned the head, the pieces, and the fat. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then he washed the entrails and the legs in water. And Moses burned the whole ram on the altar. It <i>was</i> a burnt sacrifice for a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>sweet aroma, an offering made by fire to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had commanded Moses.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And he brought the second ram, the ram of consecration. Then Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>and Moses killed <i>it.</i> Also he took <i>some</i> of its blood and put it on the tip of Aaron&#8217;s right ear, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then he brought Aaron&#8217;s sons.

And Moses sprinkled the blood all around on the altar. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then he took the fat and the fat tail, all the fat that <i>was</i> on the entrails, the fatty lobe <i>attached to</i> the liver, the two kidneys and their fat, and the right thigh; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>and from the basket of unleavened bread that was before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> he took one unleavened cake, a cake of bread <i>anointed with</i> oil, and one wafer, and put <i>them</i> on the fat and on the right thigh; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>and he put all <i>these</i> in Aaron&#8217;s hands and in his sons&#8217; hands, and waved them <i>as</i> a wave offering before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then Moses took them from their hands and burned <i>them</i> on the altar, on the burnt offering.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And Moses took the breast and waved it <i>as</i> a wave offering before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Then Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood which <i>was</i> on the altar, and sprinkled <i>it</i> on Aaron, on his garments, on his sons, and on the garments of his sons with him; and he consecrated Aaron, his garments, his sons, and the garments of his sons with him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>And Moses said to Aaron and his sons, &#8220;Boil the flesh <i>at</i> the door of the tabernacle of meeting, and eat it there with the bread that <i>is</i> in the basket of consecration offerings, as I commanded, saying, &#8216;Aaron and his sons shall eat it.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>What remains of the flesh and of the bread you shall burn with fire. </span>
