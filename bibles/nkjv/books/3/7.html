<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>In the place where they kill the burnt offering they shall kill the trespass offering. And its blood he shall sprinkle all around on the altar. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And he shall offer from it all its fat. The fat tail and the fat that covers the entrails, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>the two kidneys and the fat that <i>is</i> on them by the flanks, and the fatty lobe <i>attached</i> to the liver above the kidneys, he shall remove; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and the priest shall burn them on the altar <i>as</i> an offering made by fire to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. It <i>is</i> a trespass offering. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Every male among the priests may eat it. It shall be eaten in a holy place. It <i>is</i> most holy. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>The trespass offering <i>is</i> like the sin offering; <i>there is</i> one law for them both: the priest who makes atonement with it shall have <i>it.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And the priest who offers anyone&#8217;s burnt offering, that priest shall have for himself the skin of the burnt offering which he has offered. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Also every grain offering that is baked in the oven and all that is prepared in the covered pan, or <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>in a pan, shall be the priest&#8217;s who offers it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Every grain offering, <i>whether</i> mixed with oil or dry, shall belong to all the sons of Aaron, to one <i>as much</i> as the other.</span></p> <h3>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>If he offers it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer, with the sacrifice of thanksgiving, unleavened cakes mixed with oil, unleavened wafers anointed with oil, or cakes of blended flour mixed with oil. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Besides the cakes, <i>as</i> his offering he shall offer leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offering. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And from it he shall offer one cake from each offering <i>as</i> a heave offering to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>&#8216;The flesh that touches any unclean thing shall not be eaten. It shall be burned with fire.
