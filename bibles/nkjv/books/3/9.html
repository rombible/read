<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he said to Aaron, &#8220;Take for yourself a young bull as a sin offering and a ram as a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer <i>them</i> before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And to the children of Israel you shall speak, saying, &#8216;Take a kid of the goats as a sin offering, and a calf and a lamb, <i>both</i> of the first year, without blemish, as a burnt offering, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>also a bull and a ram as peace offerings, to sacrifice before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and a grain offering mixed with oil; for today the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will appear to you.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So they brought what Moses commanded before the tabernacle of meeting. And all the congregation drew near and stood <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then Moses said, &#8220;This <i>is</i> the thing which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> commanded you to do, and the glory of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will appear to you.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And Moses said to Aaron, &#8220;Go to the altar, offer your sin offering and your burnt offering, and make atonement for yourself and for the people. Offer the offering of the people, and make atonement for them, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> commanded.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Aaron therefore went to the altar and killed the calf of the sin offering, which <i>was</i> for himself. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then the sons of Aaron brought the blood to him. And he dipped his finger in the blood, put <i>it</i> on the horns of the altar, and poured the blood at the base of the altar. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>But the fat, the kidneys, and the fatty lobe from the liver of the sin offering he burned on the altar, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had commanded Moses. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>The flesh and the hide he burned with fire outside the camp.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And he killed the burnt offering; and Aaron&#8217;s sons presented to him the blood, which he sprinkled all around on the altar. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then they presented the burnt offering to him, with its pieces and head, and he burned <i>them</i> on the altar. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And he washed the entrails and the legs, and burned <i>them</i> with the burnt offering on the altar.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then he brought the people&#8217;s offering, and took the goat, which <i>was</i> the sin offering for the people, and killed it and offered it for sin, like the first one. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And he brought the burnt offering and offered it according to the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>prescribed manner. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then he brought the grain offering, took a handful of it, and burned <i>it</i> on the altar, besides the burnt sacrifice of the morning.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>He also killed the bull and the ram <i>as</i> sacrifices of peace offerings, which <i>were</i> for the people. And Aaron&#8217;s sons presented to him the blood, which he sprinkled all around on the altar, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>and the fat from the bull and the ram&#8212;the fatty tail, what covers <i>the entrails</i> and the kidneys, and the fatty lobe <i>attached to</i> the liver; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>and they put the fat on the breasts. Then he burned the fat on the altar; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>but the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved <i>as</i> a wave offering before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, as Moses had commanded.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then Aaron lifted his hand toward the people, blessed them, and came down from offering the sin offering, the burnt offering, and peace offerings. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of meeting, and came out and blessed the people. Then the glory of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> appeared to all the people, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>and fire came out from before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and consumed the burnt offering and the fat on the altar. When all the people saw <i>it</i>, they shouted and fell on their faces.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-2959a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Leviticus 9:5">Leviticus 9:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>in the presence of</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-2970b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Leviticus 9:16">Leviticus 9:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>ordinance</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
