<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men; for not all have faith.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you and guard <i>you</i> from the evil one. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And we have confidence in the Lord concerning you, both that you do and will do the things we command you.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now may the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the patience of Christ.</span></p> <h3>
Warning Against Idleness</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Thess-3-6"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw from every brother who walks disorderly and not according to the tradition which <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>he received from us. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For you yourselves know how you ought to follow us, for we were not disorderly among you; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>nor did we eat anyone&#8217;s bread <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>free of charge, but worked with labor and toil night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>not because we do not have authority, but to make ourselves an example of how you should follow us.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For even when we were with you, we commanded you this: If anyone will not work, neither shall he eat. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For we hear that there are some who walk among you in a disorderly manner, not working at all, but are busybodies. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now those who are such we command and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>exhort through our Lord Jesus Christ that they work in quietness and eat their own bread.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>But <i>as for</i> you, brethren, do not grow weary <i>in</i> doing good. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And if anyone does not obey our word in this <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>epistle, note that person and do not keep company with him, that he may be ashamed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Yet do not count <i>him</i> as an enemy, but <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>admonish <i>him</i> as a brother.</span></p> <h3>
Benediction</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Thess-3-16"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Now may the Lord of peace Himself give you peace always in every way. The Lord <i>be</i> with you all.</span></p> <p>
