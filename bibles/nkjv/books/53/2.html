<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>not to be soon shaken in mind or troubled, either by spirit or by word or by letter, as if from us, as though the day of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>Christ had come. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Let no one deceive you by any means; for <i>that Day will not come</i> unless the falling away comes first, and the man of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>sin is revealed, the son of perdition, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped, so that he sits <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>as God in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Do you not remember that when I was still with you I told you these things? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And now you know what is restraining, that he may be revealed in his own time. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>He who now restrains <i>will do so</i> until He is taken out of the way. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will consume with the breath of His mouth and destroy with the brightness of His coming. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>The coming of the <i>lawless one</i> is according to the working of Satan, with all power, signs, and lying wonders, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and with all unrighteous deception among those who perish, because they did not receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And for this reason God will send them strong delusion, that they should believe the lie, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>that they all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness.</span></p> <h3>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>to which He called you by our gospel, for the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. </span>
