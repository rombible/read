<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/16-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Very early in the morning, on the first <i>day</i> of the week, they came to the tomb when the sun had risen. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/16-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And they said among themselves, &#8220;Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/16-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But when they looked up, they saw that the stone had been rolled away&#8212;for it was very large. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/16-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And entering the tomb, they saw a young man clothed in a long white robe sitting on the right side; and they were alarmed.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/16-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But he said to them, &#8220;Do not be alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He is risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/16-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But go, tell His disciples&#8212;and Peter&#8212;that He is going <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>before you into Galilee; there you will see Him, as He said to you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/16-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So they went out <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>quickly and fled from the tomb, for they trembled and were amazed. And they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.</span></p> <h3>
Mary Magdalene Sees the Risen Lord</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-16-9"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/16-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Now when <i>He</i> rose early on the first <i>day</i> of the week, He appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom He had cast seven demons. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/16-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>She went and told those who had been with Him, as they mourned and wept. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/16-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And when they heard that He was alive and had been seen by her, they did not believe.</span></p> <h3>
Jesus Appears to Two Disciples</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-16-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/16-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>After that, He appeared in another form to two of them as they walked and went into the country. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/16-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And they went and told <i>it</i> to the rest, <i>but</i> they did not believe them either.</span></p> <h3>
The Great Commission</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-16-14"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/16-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Later He appeared to the eleven as they sat at the table; and He rebuked their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who had seen Him after He had risen. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/16-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Go into all the world</span> <span class="woj">and preach the gospel to every creature.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/16-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span><span class="woj">He who believes and is baptized will be saved;</span> <span class="woj">but he who does not believe will be condemned.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/16-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span><span class="woj">And these</span> <span class="woj">signs will follow those who</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span><span class="woj">believe:</span> <span class="woj">In My name they will cast out demons;</span> <span class="woj">they will speak with new tongues;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/16-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span><span class="woj">they</span><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span> <span class="woj">will take up serpents; and if they drink anything deadly, it will by no means hurt them;</span> <span class="woj">they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Christ Ascends to God&#8217;s Right Hand</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-16-19"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/16-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>So then, after the Lord had spoken to them, He was received up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/16-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And they went out and preached everywhere, the Lord working with <i>them</i> and confirming the word through the accompanying signs.
