<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And when He had come out of the boat, immediately there met Him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>who had <i>his</i> dwelling among the tombs; and no one could bind <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>him, not even with chains, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>because he had often been bound with shackles and chains. And the chains had been pulled apart by him, and the shackles broken in pieces; neither could anyone tame him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And always, night and day, he was in the mountains and in the tombs, crying out and cutting himself with stones.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>When he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and worshiped Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And he cried out with a loud voice and said, &#8220;What have I to do with You, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I implore<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> You by God that You do not torment me.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For He said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;Come out of the man, unclean spirit!&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then He asked him, <span class="woj">&#8220;What <i>is</i> your name?&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span class="text Mark-5-9">And he answered, saying, &#8220;My name <i>is</i> Legion; for we are many.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Also he begged Him earnestly that He would not send them out of the country.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now a large herd of swine was feeding there near the mountains. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So all the demons begged Him, saying, &#8220;Send us to the swine, that we may enter them.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>at once Jesus gave them permission. Then the unclean spirits went out and entered the swine (there were about two thousand); and the herd ran violently down the steep place into the sea, and drowned in the sea.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So those who fed the swine fled, and they told <i>it</i> in the city and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that had happened. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then they came to Jesus, and saw the one <i>who had been</i> demon-possessed and had the legion, sitting and clothed and in his right mind. And they were afraid. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And those who saw it told them how it happened to him <i>who had been</i> demon-possessed, and about the swine. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then they began to plead with Him to depart from their region.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And when He got into the boat, he who had been demon-possessed begged Him that he might be with Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>However, Jesus did not permit him, but said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;Go home to your friends, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how He has had compassion on you.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And he departed and began to proclaim in <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>Decapolis all that Jesus had done for him; and all marveled.</span></p> <h3>
A Girl Restored to Life and a Woman Healed</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-5-21"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Now when Jesus had crossed over again by boat to the other side, a great multitude gathered to Him; and He was by the sea. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And behold, one of the rulers of the synagogue came, Jairus by name. And when he saw Him, he fell at His feet </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>and begged Him earnestly, saying, &#8220;My little daughter lies at the point of death. Come and lay Your hands on her, that she may be healed, and she will live.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>So <i>Jesus</i> went with him, and a great multitude followed Him and thronged Him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Now a certain woman had a flow of blood for twelve years, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>and had suffered many things from many physicians. She had spent all that she had and was no better, but rather grew worse. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>When she heard about Jesus, she came behind <i>Him</i> in the crowd and touched His garment. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>For she said, &#8220;If only I may touch His clothes, I shall be made well.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Immediately the fountain of her blood was dried up, and she felt in <i>her</i> body that she was healed of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>affliction. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And Jesus, immediately knowing in Himself that power had gone out of Him, turned around in the crowd and said, <span class="woj">&#8220;Who touched My clothes?&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>But His disciples said to Him, &#8220;You see the multitude thronging You, and You say, <span class="woj">&#8216;Who touched Me?&#8217;</span> &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And He looked around to see her who had done this thing. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before Him and told Him the whole truth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>And He said to her, <span class="woj">&#8220;Daughter,</span> <span class="woj">your faith has made you well.</span> <span class="woj">Go in peace, and be healed of your affliction.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>While He was still speaking, <i>some</i> came from the ruler of the synagogue&#8217;s <i>house</i> who said, &#8220;Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, He said to the ruler of the synagogue, <span class="woj">&#8220;Do not be afraid; only</span> <span class="woj">believe.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>And He permitted no one to follow Him except Peter, James, and John the brother of James. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>Then He came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and saw <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>a tumult and those who wept and wailed loudly. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>When He came in, He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Why make this commotion and weep? The child is not dead, but</span> <span class="woj">sleeping.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>And they ridiculed Him. But when He had put them all outside, He took the father and the mother of the child, and those <i>who were</i> with Him, and entered where the child was lying. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>Then He took the child by the hand, and said to her, <span class="woj">&#8220;Talitha, cumi,&#8221;</span> which is translated, <span class="woj">&#8220;Little girl, I say to you, arise.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>Immediately the girl arose and walked, for she was twelve years <i>of age.</i> And they were overcome with great amazement. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>But He commanded them strictly that no one should know it, and said that <i>something</i> should be given her to eat.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-24366a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 5:1">Mark 5:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>Gerasenes</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24368b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 5:3">Mark 5:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU adds <i>anymore</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24372c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 5:7">Mark 5:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>adjure</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24378d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 5:13">Mark 5:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>He gave</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24385e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 5:20">Mark 5:20</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Ten Cities</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24394f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 5:29">Mark 5:29</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>suffering</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24403g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 5:38">Mark 5:38</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>an uproar</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
