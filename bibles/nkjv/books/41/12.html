<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/12-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span><span class="woj">And they took <i>him</i> and beat him and sent <i>him</i> away empty-handed.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/12-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span><span class="woj">Again he sent them another servant,</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span><span class="woj">and at him they threw stones, wounded <i>him</i> in the head, and sent <i>him</i> away shamefully treated.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/12-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span><span class="woj">And again he sent another, and him they killed; and many others,</span> <span class="woj">beating some and killing some.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/12-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span><span class="woj">Therefore still having one son, his beloved, he also sent him to them last, saying, &#8216;They will respect my son.&#8217;</span> </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/12-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><span class="woj">So they took him and</span> <span class="woj">killed <i>him</i> and cast <i>him</i> out of the vineyard.</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/12-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;Therefore what will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the vinedressers, and give the vineyard to others.</span> </span>

The Pharisees: Is It Lawful to Pay Taxes to Caesar?</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-12-13"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/12-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then they sent to Him some of the Pharisees and the Herodians, to catch Him in <i>His</i> words. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/12-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>When they had come, they said to Him, &#8220;Teacher, we know that You are true, and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>care about no one; for You do not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>regard the person of men, but teach the way of God in truth.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/12-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Shall we pay, or shall we not pay?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Mark-12-15">But He, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Why do you test Me?

The Sadducees: What About the Resurrection?</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-12-18"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/12-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then <i>some</i> Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Him; and they asked Him, saying: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/12-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>&#8220;Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if a man&#8217;s brother dies, and leaves <i>his</i> wife behind, and leaves no children, his brother should take his wife and raise up offspring for his brother. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/12-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Now there were seven brothers. The first took a wife; and dying, he left no offspring. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/12-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And the second took her, and he died; nor did he leave any offspring. And the third likewise. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/12-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So the seven had her and left no offspring. Last of all the woman died also. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/12-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Therefore, in the resurrection, when they rise, whose wife will she be? For all seven had her as wife.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/12-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Jesus answered and said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Are you not therefore</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span><span class="woj">mistaken, because you do not know the Scriptures nor the power of God?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/12-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span><span class="woj">For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but</span> <span class="woj">are like angels in heaven.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/12-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span><span class="woj">But concerning the dead, that they</span> <span class="woj">rise, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the <i>burning</i> bush <i>passage,</i> how God spoke to him, saying,</span> <span class="woj">&#8216;I <i>am</i> the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob&#8217;?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/12-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span><span class="woj">He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living.

The Scribes: Which Is the First Commandment of All?</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-12-28"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/12-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>perceiving that He had answered them well, asked Him, &#8220;Which is the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>first commandment of all?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/12-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Jesus answered him, <span class="woj">&#8220;The</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span><span class="woj">first of all the commandments <i>is:</i></span> <span class="woj">&#8216;Hear, O Israel, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> is one.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/12-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span><span class="woj">And you shall</span> <span class="woj">love the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.&#8217;</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[l]</a></span><span class="woj">This <i>is</i> the first commandment.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/12-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span><span class="woj">And the second, like <i>it, is</i> this:</span> <span class="woj">&#8216;You shall love your neighbor as yourself.&#8217; There is no other commandment greater than</span> <span class="woj">these.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/12-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>So the scribe said to Him, &#8220;Well <i>said,</i> Teacher. You have spoken the truth, for there is one God, and there is no other but He. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/12-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And to love Him with all the heart, with all the understanding, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[m]</a></span>with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love one&#8217;s neighbor as oneself, is more than all the whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/12-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Now when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, He said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;You are not far from the kingdom of God.&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span class="text Mark-12-34">But after that no one dared question Him.</span></p> <h3>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/12-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span><span class="woj">For David himself said</span> <span class="woj">by the Holy Spirit:</span></span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Mark-12-36"><span class="woj">&#8216;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to my Lord,</span></span><br /><span class="text Mark-12-36"><span class="woj">&#8220;Sit at My right hand,</span></span><br /><span class="text Mark-12-36"><span class="woj">Till I make Your enemies Your footstool.&#8221; &#8217;</span></span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none top-1">

Beware of the Scribes</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-12-38"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/12-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>Then He said to them in His teaching, <span class="woj">&#8220;Beware of the scribes, who desire to go around in long robes,</span> <span class="woj"><i>love</i> greetings in the marketplaces,</span> </span>
