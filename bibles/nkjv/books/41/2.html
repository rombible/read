<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>Immediately many gathered together, so that there was no longer room to receive <i>them,</i> not even near the door. And He preached the word to them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then they came to Him, bringing a paralytic who was carried by four <i>men.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And when they could not come near Him because of the crowd, they uncovered the roof where He was. So when they had broken through, they let down the bed on which the paralytic was lying.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, <span class="woj">&#8220;Son, your sins are forgiven you.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And some of the scribes were sitting there and reasoning in their hearts, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8220;Why does this <i>Man</i> speak blasphemies like this? Who can forgive sins but God alone?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But immediately, when Jesus perceived in His spirit that they reasoned thus within themselves, He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Why do you reason about these things in your hearts?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span><span class="woj">Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, &#8216;<i>Your</i> sins are forgiven you,&#8217; or to say, &#8216;Arise, take up your bed and walk&#8217;?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><span class="woj">But that you may know that the Son of Man has</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span><span class="woj">power on earth to forgive sins&#8221;</span>&#8212;He said to the paralytic, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;I say to you, arise, take up your bed, and go to your house.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went out in the presence of them all, so that all were amazed and glorified God, saying, &#8220;We never saw <i>anything</i> like this!&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Matthew the Tax Collector</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-2-13"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then He went out again by the sea; and all the multitude came to Him, and He taught them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>As He passed by, He saw Levi the <i>son</i> of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office. And He said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;Follow Me.&#8221;</span> So he arose and followed Him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Now it happened, as He was dining in <i>Levi&#8217;s</i> house, that many tax collectors and sinners also sat together with Jesus and His disciples; for there were many, and they followed Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And when the scribes <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>and Pharisees saw Him eating with the tax collectors and sinners, they said to His disciples, &#8220;How <i>is it</i> that He eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>When Jesus heard <i>it,</i> He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I did not come to call <i>the</i> righteous, but sinners,</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span><span class="woj">to repentance.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Jesus Is Questioned About Fasting</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-2-18"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>The disciples of John and of the Pharisees were fasting. Then they came and said to Him, &#8220;Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but Your disciples do not fast?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And Jesus said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Can the</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span><span class="woj">friends of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span><span class="woj">But the days will come when the bridegroom will be</span> <span class="woj">taken away from them, and then they will fast in those days.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span><span class="woj">No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; or else the new piece pulls away from the old, and the tear is made worse.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span><span class="woj">And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; or else the new wine bursts the wineskins, the wine is spilled, and the wineskins are ruined. But new wine must be put into new wineskins.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Jesus Is Lord of the Sabbath</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-2-23"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Now it happened that He went through the grainfields on the Sabbath; and as they went His disciples began to pluck the heads of grain. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And the Pharisees said to Him, &#8220;Look, why do they do what is not lawful on the Sabbath?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>But He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Have you never read</span> <span class="woj">what David did when he was in need and hungry, he and those with him:</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span><span class="woj">how he went into the house of God <i>in the days</i> of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the showbread,</span> <span class="woj">which is not lawful to eat except for the priests, and also gave some to those who were with him?&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the</span> <span class="woj">Sabbath.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span><span class="woj">Therefore</span> <span class="woj">the Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath.&#8221;</span></span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-24263a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 2:2">Mark 2:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>Immediately</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24271b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 2:10">Mark 2:10</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>authority</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24277c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 2:16">Mark 2:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>of the</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24278d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 2:17">Mark 2:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>to repentance</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24280e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 2:19">Mark 2:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>sons of the bridechamber</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
