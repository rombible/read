<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>John came baptizing in the wilderness and preaching a baptism of repentance <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>for the remission of sins. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then all the land of Judea, and those from Jerusalem, went out to him and were all baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now John was clothed with camel&#8217;s hair and with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And he preached, saying, &#8220;There comes One after me who is mightier than I, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to stoop down and loose. </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then a voice came from heaven, &#8220;You are My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Satan Tempts Jesus</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-1-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Immediately the Spirit <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>drove Him into the wilderness. </span>

Four Fishermen Called as Disciples</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-1-16"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And as He walked by the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then Jesus said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Follow Me, and I will make you become</span> <span class="woj">fishers of men.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>They immediately left their nets and followed Him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>When He had gone a little farther from there, He saw James the <i>son</i> of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also <i>were</i> in the boat mending their nets. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And immediately He called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after Him.</span></p> <h3>
Jesus Casts Out an Unclean Spirit</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-1-21"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then they went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath He entered the synagogue and taught. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And they were astonished at His teaching, for He taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Now there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit. And he cried out, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>saying, &#8220;Let <i>us</i> alone! What have we to do with You, Jesus of Nazareth? Did You come to destroy us? I know who You are&#8212;the Holy One of God!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>But Jesus rebuked him, saying, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;Be quiet, and come out of him!&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And when the unclean spirit had convulsed him and cried out with a loud voice, he came out of him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Then they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>&#8220;What is this? What new <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>doctrine <i>is</i> this? For with authority He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And immediately His fame spread throughout all the region around Galilee.</span></p> <h3>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>But Simon&#8217;s wife&#8217;s mother lay sick with a fever, and they told Him about her at once. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>So He came and took her by the hand and lifted her up, and immediately the fever left her. And she served them.</span></p> <h3>
Many Healed After Sabbath Sunset</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-1-32"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>At evening, when the sun had set, they brought to Him all who were sick and those who were demon-possessed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And the whole city was gathered together at the door. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Then He healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons; and He did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew Him.</span></p> <h3>
Preaching in Galilee</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-1-35"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Now in the morning, having risen a long while before daylight, He went out and departed to a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span>solitary place; and there He prayed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>And Simon and those <i>who were</i> with Him searched for Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>When they found Him, they said to Him, &#8220;Everyone is looking for You.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>But He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also, because</span> <span class="woj">for this purpose I have come forth.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>And He was preaching in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and casting out demons.</span></p> <h3>
Jesus Cleanses a Leper</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-1-40"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>Now a leper came to Him, imploring Him, kneeling down to Him and saying to Him, &#8220;If You are willing, You can make me clean.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>Then Jesus, moved with compassion, stretched out <i>His</i> hand and touched him, and said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;I am willing; be cleansed.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>As soon as He had spoken, immediately the leprosy left him, and he was cleansed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>And He strictly warned him and sent him away at once, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>and said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;See that you say nothing to anyone; but go your way, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing those things</span> <span class="woj">which Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
