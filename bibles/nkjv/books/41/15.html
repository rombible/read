<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then Pilate asked Him, &#8220;Are You the King of the Jews?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Mark-15-2">He answered and said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;<i>It is as</i> you say.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And the chief priests accused Him of many things, but He answered nothing. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then Pilate asked Him again, saying, &#8220;Do You answer nothing? See how many things <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>they testify against You!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But Jesus still answered nothing, so that Pilate marveled.</span></p> <h3>
Taking the Place of Barabbas</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-15-6"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now at the feast he was accustomed to releasing one prisoner to them, whomever they requested. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And there was one named Barabbas, <i>who was</i> chained with his fellow rebels; they had committed murder in the rebellion. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then the multitude, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>crying aloud, began to ask <i>him to do</i> just as he had always done for them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But Pilate answered them, saying, &#8220;Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For he knew that the chief priests had handed Him over because of envy.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But the chief priests stirred up the crowd, so that he should rather release Barabbas to them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Pilate answered and said to them again, &#8220;What then do you want me to do <i>with Him</i> whom you call the King of the Jews?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So they cried out again, &#8220;Crucify Him!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then Pilate said to them, &#8220;Why, what evil has He done?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Mark-15-14">But they cried out all the more, &#8220;Crucify Him!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So Pilate, wanting to gratify the crowd, released Barabbas to them; and he delivered Jesus, after he had scourged <i>Him,</i> to be crucified.</span></p> <h3>
The Soldiers Mock Jesus</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-15-16"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then the soldiers led Him away into the hall called <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Praetorium, and they called together the whole garrison. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And they clothed Him with purple; and they twisted a crown of thorns, put it on His <i>head,</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>and began to salute Him, &#8220;Hail, King of the Jews!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then they struck Him on the head with a reed and spat on Him; and bowing the knee, they worshiped Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And when they had mocked Him, they took the purple off Him, put His own clothes on Him, and led Him out to crucify Him.</span></p> <h3>
The King on a Cross</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-15-21"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then they compelled a certain man, Simon a Cyrenian, the father of Alexander and Rufus, as he was coming out of the country and passing by, to bear His cross. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And they brought Him to the place Golgotha, which is translated, Place of a Skull. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Then they gave Him wine mingled with myrrh to drink, but He did not take <i>it.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And when they crucified Him, they divided His garments, casting lots for them <i>to determine</i> what every man should take.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Now it was the third hour, and they crucified Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And the inscription of His <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>accusation was written above:</span></p><p class="center_top-1"><span class="text Mark-15-26">THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span></p> <p class="first-line-none top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>With Him they also crucified two robbers, one on His right and the other on His left. </span> 
28<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>So the Scripture was fulfilled which says, <span class="oblique">&#8220;And He was numbered with the transgressors.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And those who passed by blasphemed Him, wagging their heads and saying, &#8220;Aha! <i>You</i> who destroy the temple and build <i>it</i> in three days, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>save Yourself, and come down from the cross!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Likewise the chief priests also, mocking among themselves with the scribes, said, &#8220;He saved others; Himself He cannot save. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Let the Christ, the King of Israel, descend now from the cross, that we may see and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>believe.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Mark-15-32">Even those who were crucified with Him reviled Him.</span></p> <h3>
Jesus Dies on the Cross</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-15-33"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Now when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, <span class="woj">&#8220;Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?&#8221;</span> which is translated, <span class="woj">&#8220;My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Some of those who stood by, when they heard <i>that,</i> said, &#8220;Look, He is calling for Elijah!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Then someone ran and filled a sponge full of sour wine, put <i>it</i> on a reed, and offered <i>it</i> to Him to drink, saying, &#8220;Let Him alone; let us see if Elijah will come to take Him down.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>And Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and breathed His last.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>Then the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>So when the centurion, who stood opposite Him, saw that <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>He cried out like this and breathed His last, he said, &#8220;Truly this Man was the Son of God!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>There were also women looking on from afar, among whom were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the Less and of Joses, and Salome, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>who also followed Him and ministered to Him when He was in Galilee, and many other women who came up with Him to Jerusalem.</span></p> <h3>
Jesus Buried in Joseph&#8217;s Tomb</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-15-42"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>Now when evening had come, because it was the Preparation Day, that is, the day before the Sabbath, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent council member, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, coming and taking courage, went in to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>Pilate marveled that He was already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him if He had been dead for some time. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>So when he found out from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span>Then he bought fine linen, took Him down, and wrapped Him in the linen. And he laid Him in a tomb which had been hewn out of the rock, and rolled a stone against the door of the tomb. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-47.htm"><b>47</b></a></span>And Mary Magdalene and Mary <i>the mother</i> of Joses observed where He was laid.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-24831a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 15:4">Mark 15:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>of which they accuse You</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24835b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 15:8">Mark 15:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>going up</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24843c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 15:16">Mark 15:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>The governor&#8217;s headquarters</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24853d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 15:26">Mark 15:26</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>crime</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24855e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 15:28">Mark 15:28</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits v. <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Mark.15.28" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=Mark.15.28&amp;version=NKJV">28</span>.</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24859f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 15:32">Mark 15:32</span> <span class='footnote-text'>M <i>believe Him</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24866g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 15:39">Mark 15:39</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>He thus breathed His last</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
