<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Go into the village opposite you; and as soon as you have entered it you will find a colt tied, on which no one has sat. Loose it and bring <i>it.</i></span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span><span class="woj">And if anyone says to you, &#8216;Why are you doing this?&#8217; say, &#8216;The Lord has need of it,&#8217; and immediately he will send it here.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So they went their way, and found <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>the colt tied by the door outside on the street, and they loosed it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But some of those who stood there said to them, &#8220;What are you doing, loosing the colt?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And they spoke to them just as Jesus had commanded. So they let them go. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their clothes on it, and He sat on it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And many spread their clothes on the road, and others cut down leafy branches from the trees and spread <i>them</i> on the road. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then those who went before and those who followed cried out, saying:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Mark-11-9">&#8220;Hosanna!</span><br /><span class="text Mark-11-9"><span class="oblique">&#8216;Blessed</span> <i>is</i> <span class="oblique">He who comes in the name of the</span> <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span><span class="oblique">!&#8217;</span></span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Blessed <i>is</i> the kingdom of our father David</span><br /><span class="text Mark-11-10">That comes <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>in the name of the Lord!</span><br /><span class="text Mark-11-10">Hosanna in the highest!&#8221;</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And Jesus went into Jerusalem and into the temple. So when He had looked around at all things, as the hour was already late, He went out to Bethany with the twelve.</span></p> <h3>
The Fig Tree Withered</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-11-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now the next day, when they had come out from Bethany, He was hungry. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And seeing from afar a fig tree having leaves, He went to see if perhaps He would find something on it. When He came to it, He found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/11-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>In response Jesus said to it, <span class="woj">&#8220;Let no one eat fruit from you ever again.&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span class="text Mark-11-14">And His disciples heard <i>it.</i></span></p> <h3>
Jesus Cleanses the Temple</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-11-15"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/11-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So they came to Jerusalem. Then Jesus went into the temple and began to drive out those who bought and sold in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/11-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And He would not allow anyone to carry wares through the temple. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/11-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then He taught, saying to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Is it not written,</span> <span class="woj">&#8216;My house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations&#8217;? But you have made it a</span> <span class="woj">&#8216;den of thieves.&#8217;</span> <span class="woj">&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/11-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And the scribes and chief priests heard it and sought how they might destroy Him; for they feared Him, because all the people were astonished at His teaching. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/11-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>When evening had come, He went out of the city.</span></p> <h3>
The Lesson of the Withered Fig Tree</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-11-20"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/11-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Now in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/11-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And Peter, remembering, said to Him, &#8220;Rabbi, look! The fig tree which You cursed has withered away.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/11-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So Jesus answered and said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Have faith in God.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/11-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span><span class="woj">For</span> <span class="woj">assuredly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, &#8216;Be removed and be cast into the sea,&#8217; and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that those things he says will be done, he will have whatever he says.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/11-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span><span class="woj">Therefore I say to you,</span> <span class="woj">whatever things you ask when you pray, believe that you receive <i>them,</i> and you will have <i>them.</i></span></span></p> <h3>
Forgiveness and Prayer</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-11-25"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/11-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;And whenever you stand praying,</span> <span class="woj">if you have anything against anyone, forgive him, that your Father in heaven may also forgive you your trespasses.</span> </span> 
26<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span><span class="woj">But</span> <span class="woj">if you do not forgive, neither will your Father in heaven forgive your trespasses.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Jesus&#8217; Authority Questioned</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-11-27"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/11-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Then they came again to Jerusalem. And as He was walking in the temple, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders came to Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/11-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And they said to Him, &#8220;By what authority are You doing these things? And who gave You this authority to do these things?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/11-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>But Jesus answered and said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;I also will ask you one question; then answer Me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things:</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/11-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span><span class="woj">The</span> <span class="woj">baptism of John&#8212;was it from heaven or from men? Answer Me.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/11-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>And they reasoned among themselves, saying, &#8220;If we say, &#8216;From heaven,&#8217; He will say, &#8216;Why then did you not believe him?&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/11-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>But if we say, &#8216;From men&#8217; &#8221;&#8212;they feared the people, for all counted John to have been a prophet indeed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/11-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>So they answered and said to Jesus, &#8220;We do not know.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Mark-11-33">And Jesus answered and said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.&#8221;</span></span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-24642a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 11:1">Mark 11:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>M <i>Bethsphage</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24645b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 11:4">Mark 11:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M <i>a</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24651c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 11:10">Mark 11:10</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>in the name of the Lord</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24667d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 11:26">Mark 11:26</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits v. <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Mark.11.26" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=Mark.11.26&amp;version=NKJV">26</span>.</span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
