<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;I have</span> <span class="woj">compassion on the multitude, because they have now continued with Me three days and have nothing to eat.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span><span class="woj">And if I send them away hungry to their own houses, they will faint on the way; for some of them have come from afar.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then His disciples answered Him, &#8220;How can one satisfy these people with bread here in the wilderness?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>He asked them, <span class="woj">&#8220;How many loaves do you have?&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span class="text Mark-8-5">And they said, &#8220;Seven.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground. And He took the seven loaves and gave thanks, broke <i>them</i> and gave <i>them</i> to His disciples to set before <i>them;</i> and they set <i>them</i> before the multitude. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>They also had a few small fish; and having blessed them, He said to set them also before <i>them.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So they ate and were filled, and they took up seven large baskets of leftover fragments. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Now those who had eaten were about four thousand. And He sent them away, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>immediately got into the boat with His disciples, and came to the region of Dalmanutha.</span></p> <h3>
The Pharisees Seek a Sign</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-8-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then the Pharisees came out and began to dispute with Him, seeking from Him a sign from heaven, testing Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But He sighed deeply in His spirit, and said, <span class="woj">&#8220;Why does this generation seek a sign? Assuredly, I say to you,</span> <span class="woj">no sign shall be given to this generation.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Beware of the Leaven of the Pharisees and Herod</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-8-13"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And He left them, and getting into the boat again, departed to the other side. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Now <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>the disciples had forgotten to take bread, and they did not have more than one loaf with them in the boat. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then He charged them, saying, <span class="woj">&#8220;Take heed, beware of the</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span><span class="woj">leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And they reasoned among themselves, saying, &#8220;<i>It is</i> because we have no bread.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But Jesus, being aware of <i>it,</i> said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Why do you reason because you have no bread?</span> <span class="woj">Do you not yet perceive nor understand? Is your heart</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span><span class="woj">still hardened?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span><span class="woj">Having eyes, do you not see? And having ears, do you not hear? And do you not remember?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span><span class="woj">When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments did you take up?&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span class="text Mark-8-19">They said to Him, &#8220;Twelve.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;Also,</span> <span class="woj">when I broke the seven for the four thousand, how many large baskets full of fragments did you take up?&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span class="text Mark-8-20">And they said, &#8220;Seven.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>So He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;How <i>is it</i></span> <span class="woj">you do not understand?&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
A Blind Man Healed at Bethsaida</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-8-22"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then He came to Bethsaida; and they brought a blind man to Him, and begged Him to touch him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>So He took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the town. And when He had spit on his eyes and put His hands on him, He asked him if he saw anything.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And he looked up and said, &#8220;I see men like trees, walking.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then He put <i>His</i> hands on his eyes again and made him look up. And he was restored and saw everyone clearly. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Then He sent him away to his house, saying, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;Neither go into the town,</span> <span class="woj">nor tell anyone in the town.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Peter Confesses Jesus as the Christ</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-8-27"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Now Jesus and His disciples went out to the towns of Caesarea Philippi; and on the road He asked His disciples, saying to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Who do men say that I am?&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>So they answered, &#8220;John the Baptist; but some <i>say,</i> Elijah; and others, one of the prophets.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;But who do you say that I am?&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span class="text Mark-8-29">Peter answered and said to Him, &#8220;You are the Christ.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Then He strictly warned them that they should tell no one about Him.</span></p> <h3>
Jesus Predicts His Death and Resurrection</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-8-31"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>And He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>He spoke this word openly. Then Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>But when He had turned around and looked at His disciples, He rebuked Peter, saying, <span class="woj">&#8220;Get behind Me, Satan! For you are not</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span><span class="woj">mindful of the things of God, but the things of men.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Take Up the Cross and Follow Him</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-8-34"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>When He had called the people to <i>Himself,</i> with His disciples also, He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Whoever desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span><span class="woj">For</span> <span class="woj">whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake and the gospel&#8217;s will save it.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span><span class="woj">For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span><span class="woj">Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span><span class="woj">For whoever</span> <span class="woj">is ashamed of Me and My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him the Son of Man also will be ashamed when He comes in the glory of His Father with the holy angels.&#8221;</span></span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-24515a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 8:14">Mark 8:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M <i>they</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24516b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 8:15">Mark 8:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>yeast</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24518c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 8:17">Mark 8:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>still</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24527d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 8:26">Mark 8:26</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>&#8220;Do not even go into the town.&#8221;</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24534e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 8:33">Mark 8:33</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>setting your mind on</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
