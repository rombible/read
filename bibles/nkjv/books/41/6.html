<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And when the Sabbath had come, He began to teach in the synagogue. And many hearing <i>Him</i> were astonished, saying, &#8220;Where <i>did</i> this Man <i>get</i> these things? And what wisdom <i>is</i> this which is given to Him, that such mighty works are performed by His hands! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Is this not the carpenter, the Son of Mary, and brother of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon? And are not His sisters here with us?&#8221; So they were offended at Him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But Jesus said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;A prophet is not without honor except in his own country, among his own relatives, and in his own house.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now He could do no mighty work there, except that He laid His hands on a few sick people and healed <i>them.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And He marveled because of their unbelief. Then He went about the villages in a circuit, teaching.</span></p> <h3>
Sending Out the Twelve</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-6-7"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And He called the twelve to <i>Himself,</i> and began to send them out two <i>by</i> two, and gave them power over unclean spirits. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>He commanded them to take nothing for the journey except a staff&#8212;no bag, no bread, no copper in <i>their</i> money belts&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>but to wear sandals, and not to put on two tunics.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Also He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;In whatever place you enter a house, stay there till you depart from that place.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span><span class="woj">And</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span><span class="woj">whoever will not receive you nor hear you, when you depart from there,</span> <span class="woj">shake off the dust under your feet as a testimony against them.</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span><span class="woj">Assuredly, I say to you, it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city!&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So they went out and preached that <i>people</i> should repent. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many who were sick, and healed <i>them.</i></span></p> <h3>
John the Baptist Beheaded</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-6-14"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Now King Herod heard <i>of Him,</i> for His name had become well known. And he said, &#8220;John the Baptist is risen from the dead, and therefore these powers are at work in him.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Others said, &#8220;It is Elijah.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Mark-6-15">And others said, &#8220;It is <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>the Prophet, or like one of the prophets.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But when Herod heard, he said, &#8220;This is John, whom I beheaded; he has been raised from the dead!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>For Herod himself had sent and laid hold of John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip&#8217;s wife; for he had married her. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Because John had said to Herod, &#8220;It is not lawful for you to have your brother&#8217;s wife.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Therefore Herodias <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>held it against him and wanted to kill him, but she could not; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>for Herod feared John, knowing that he <i>was</i> a just and holy man, and he protected him. And when he heard him, he <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>did many things, and heard him gladly.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then an opportune day came when Herod on his birthday gave a feast for his nobles, the high officers, and the chief <i>men</i> of Galilee. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And when Herodias&#8217; daughter herself came in and danced, and pleased Herod and those who sat with him, the king said to the girl, &#8220;Ask me whatever you want, and I will give <i>it</i> to you.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>He also swore to her, &#8220;Whatever you ask me, I will give you, up to half my kingdom.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>So she went out and said to her mother, &#8220;What shall I ask?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Mark-6-24">And she said, &#8220;The head of John the Baptist!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Immediately she came in with haste to the king and asked, saying, &#8220;I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And the king was exceedingly sorry; <i>yet,</i> because of the oaths and because of those who sat with him, he did not want to refuse her. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Immediately the king sent an executioner and commanded his head to be brought. And he went and beheaded him in prison, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to her mother. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>When his disciples heard <i>of it,</i> they came and took away his corpse and laid it in a tomb.</span></p> <h3>
Feeding the Five Thousand</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-6-30"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Then the apostles gathered to Jesus and told Him all things, both what they had done and what they had taught. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>And He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Come aside by yourselves to a deserted place and rest a while.&#8221;</span> For there were many coming and going, and they did not even have time to eat. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>So they departed to a deserted place in the boat by themselves.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>But <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>the multitudes saw them departing, and many knew Him and ran there on foot from all the cities. They arrived before them and came together to Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>And Jesus, when He came out, saw a great multitude and was moved with compassion for them, because they were like sheep not having a shepherd. So He began to teach them many things. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>When the day was now far spent, His disciples came to Him and said, &#8220;This is a deserted place, and already the hour <i>is</i> late. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Send them away, that they may go into the surrounding country and villages and buy themselves <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>bread; for they have nothing to eat.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>But He answered and said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;You give them something to eat.&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span class="text Mark-6-37">And they said to Him, &#8220;Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give them <i>something</i> to eat?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>But He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;How many loaves do you have? Go and see.&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span class="text Mark-6-38">And when they found out they said, &#8220;Five, and two fish.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>Then He commanded them to make them all sit down in groups on the green grass. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>So they sat down in ranks, in hundreds and in fifties. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>And when He had taken the five loaves and the two fish, He looked up to heaven, blessed and broke the loaves, and gave <i>them</i> to His disciples to set before them; and the two fish He divided among <i>them</i> all. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>So they all ate and were filled. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>And they took up twelve baskets full of fragments and of the fish. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>Now those who had eaten the loaves were <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>about five thousand men.</span></p> <h3>
Jesus Walks on the Sea</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-6-45"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>Immediately He <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>made His disciples get into the boat and go before Him to the other side, to Bethsaida, while He sent the multitude away. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span>And when He had sent them away, He departed to the mountain to pray. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-47.htm"><b>47</b></a></span>Now when evening came, the boat was in the middle of the sea; and He <i>was</i> alone on the land. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-48.htm"><b>48</b></a></span>Then He saw them straining at rowing, for the wind was against them. Now about the fourth watch of the night He came to them, walking on the sea, and would have passed them by. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-49.htm"><b>49</b></a></span>And when they saw Him walking on the sea, they supposed it was a ghost, and cried out; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-50.htm"><b>50</b></a></span>for they all saw Him and were troubled. But immediately He talked with them and said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Be</span><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span> <span class="woj">of good cheer! It is I; do not be</span> <span class="woj">afraid.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-51.htm"><b>51</b></a></span>Then He went up into the boat to them, and the wind ceased. And they were greatly amazed in themselves beyond measure, and marveled. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-52.htm"><b>52</b></a></span>For they had not understood about the loaves, because their heart was hardened.</span></p> <h3>
Many Touch Him and Are Made Well</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-6-53"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-53.htm"><b>53</b></a></span>When they had crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret and anchored there. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-54.htm"><b>54</b></a></span>And when they came out of the boat, immediately <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span>the people recognized Him, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-55.htm"><b>55</b></a></span>ran through that whole surrounding region, and began to carry about on beds those who were sick to wherever they heard He was. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-56.htm"><b>56</b></a></span>Wherever He entered, into villages, cities, or the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and begged Him that they might just touch the hem of His garment. And as many as touched Him were made well.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-24419a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 6:11">Mark 6:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>whatever place</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24419b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 6:11">Mark 6:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits the rest of v. <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Mark.6.11" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=Mark.6.11&amp;version=NKJV">11</span>.</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24423c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 6:15">Mark 6:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M <i>a prophet, like one</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24427d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 6:19">Mark 6:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>held a grudge</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24428e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 6:20">Mark 6:20</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>was very perplexed, yet</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24441f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 6:33">Mark 6:33</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M <i>they</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24444g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 6:36">Mark 6:36</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>something to eat</i> and omits the rest of v. <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Mark.6.36" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=Mark.6.36&amp;version=NKJV">36</span>.</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24452h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 6:44">Mark 6:44</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M omit <i>about</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24453i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 6:45">Mark 6:45</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>invited, strongly urged</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24458j"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 6:50">Mark 6:50</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Take courage</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24462k"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 6:54">Mark 6:54</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>they</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
