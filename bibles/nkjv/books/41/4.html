And a great multitude was gathered to Him, so that He got into a boat and sat <i>in it</i> on the sea; and the whole multitude was on the land facing the sea. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then He taught them many things by parables, and said to them in His teaching:</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;Listen! Behold, a sower went out to sow.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span><span class="woj">And it happened, as he sowed, <i>that</i> some <i>seed</i> fell by the wayside; and the birds</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span><span class="woj">of the air came and devoured it.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span><span class="woj">Some fell on stony ground, where it did not have much earth; and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of earth.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span><span class="woj">But when the sun was up it was scorched, and because it had no root it withered away.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span><span class="woj">And some <i>seed</i> fell among thorns; and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span><span class="woj">crop.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><span class="woj">But other <i>seed</i> fell on good ground and yielded a crop that sprang up, increased and produced: some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some a hundred.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And He said <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;He who has ears to hear, let him hear!&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
The Purpose of Parables</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-4-10"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>But when He was alone, those around Him with the twelve asked Him about the parable. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;To you it has been given to</span> <span class="woj">know the</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span><span class="woj">mystery of the kingdom of God; but to</span> <span class="woj">those who are outside, all things come in parables,</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span><span class="woj">so that</span></span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Mark-4-12"><span class="woj">&#8216;Seeing they may see and not perceive,</span></span><br /><span class="text Mark-4-12"><span class="woj">And hearing they may hear and not understand;</span></span><br /><span class="text Mark-4-12"><span class="woj">Lest they should turn,</span></span><br /><span class="text Mark-4-12"><span class="woj">And <i>their</i> sins be forgiven them.&#8217;</span> <span class="woj">&#8221;</span></span></p></div> <h3>
The Parable of the Sower Explained</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-4-13"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Do you not understand this parable? How then will you understand all the parables?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/4-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span><span class="woj">The sower sows the word.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/4-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span><span class="woj">And these are the ones by the wayside where the word is sown. When they hear, Satan comes immediately and takes away the word that was sown in their hearts.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/4-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span><span class="woj">These likewise are the ones sown on stony ground who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with gladness;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/4-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span><span class="woj">and they have no root in themselves, and so endure only for a time. Afterward, when tribulation or persecution arises for the word&#8217;s sake, immediately they stumble.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/4-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span><span class="woj">Now these are the ones sown among thorns; <i>they are</i> the ones who hear the word,</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/4-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span><span class="woj">and the</span> <span class="woj">cares of this world,</span> <span class="woj">the deceitfulness of riches, and the desires for other things entering in choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/4-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span><span class="woj">But these are the ones sown on good ground, those who hear the word,</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span><span class="woj">accept <i>it,</i> and bear</span> <span class="woj">fruit: some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some a hundred.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Light Under a Basket</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-4-21"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/4-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Also He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Is a lamp brought to be put under a basket or under a bed? Is it not to be set on a lampstand?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/4-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span><span class="woj">For there is nothing hidden which will not be revealed, nor has anything been kept secret but that it should come to light.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/4-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span><span class="woj">If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/4-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Take heed what you hear.</span> <span class="woj">With the same measure you use, it will be measured to you; and to you who hear, more will be given.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/4-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span><span class="woj">For whoever has, to him more will be given; but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
The Parable of the Growing Seed</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-4-26"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/4-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And He said, <span class="woj">&#8220;The kingdom of God is as if a man should</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span><span class="woj">scatter seed on the ground,</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/4-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span><span class="woj">and should sleep by night and rise by day, and the seed should sprout and</span> <span class="woj">grow, he himself does not know how.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/4-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span><span class="woj">For the earth</span> <span class="woj">yields crops by itself: first the blade, then the head, after that the full grain in the head.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/4-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span><span class="woj">But when the grain ripens, immediately</span> <span class="woj">he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
The Parable of the Mustard Seed</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-4-30"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/4-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Then He said, <span class="woj">&#8220;To what shall we liken the kingdom of God? Or with what parable shall we picture it?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/4-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span><span class="woj"><i>It is</i> like a mustard seed which, when it is sown on the ground, is smaller than all the seeds on earth;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/4-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span><span class="woj">but when it is sown, it grows up and becomes greater than all herbs, and shoots out large branches, so that the birds of the air may nest under its shade.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Jesus&#8217; Use of Parables</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-4-33"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/4-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And with many such parables He spoke the word to them as they were able to hear <i>it.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/4-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>But without a parable He did not speak to them. And when they were alone, He explained all things to His disciples.</span></p> <h3>
Wind and Wave Obey Jesus</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-4-35"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/4-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>On the same day, when evening had come, He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Let us cross over to the other side.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/4-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Now when they had left the multitude, they took Him along in the boat as He was. And other little boats were also with Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/4-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>And a great windstorm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that it was already filling. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/4-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>But He was in the stern, asleep on a pillow. And they awoke Him and said to Him, &#8220;Teacher, do You not care that we are perishing?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/4-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>Then He arose and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, <span class="woj">&#8220;Peace,</span><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span> <span class="woj">be still!&#8221;</span> And the wind ceased and there was a great calm. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/4-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>But He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Why are you so fearful?</span> <span class="woj">How</span><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span> <span class="woj"><i>is it</i> that you have no faith?&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/4-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>And they feared exceedingly, and said to one another, &#8220;Who can this be, that even the wind and the sea obey Him!&#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-24328a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 4:4">Mark 4:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M omit <i>of the air</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24331b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 4:7">Mark 4:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>fruit</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24333c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 4:9">Mark 4:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M omit <i>to them</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24335d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 4:11">Mark 4:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>secret</i> or <i>hidden truths</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24344e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 4:20">Mark 4:20</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>receive</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24350f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 4:26">Mark 4:26</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>sow</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24363g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 4:39">Mark 4:39</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Be quiet</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24364h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Mark 4:40">Mark 4:40</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>Have you still no faith?</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
