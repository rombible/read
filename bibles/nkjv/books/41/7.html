<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/7-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Now <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>when they saw some of His disciples eat bread with defiled, that is, with unwashed hands, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>they found fault. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/7-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash <i>their</i> hands <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>in a special way, holding the tradition of the elders. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span><i>When they come</i> from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they wash.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/7-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then the Pharisees and scribes asked Him, &#8220;Why do Your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashed hands?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/7-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>He answered and said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Well did Isaiah prophesy of you</span> <span class="woj">hypocrites, as it is written:</span></span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Mark-7-6"><span class="woj">&#8216;This people honors Me with <i>their</i> lips,</span></span><br /><span class="text Mark-7-6"><span class="woj">But their heart is far from Me.</span></span><br />

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;<i>All too</i> well</span> <span class="woj">you</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span><span class="woj">reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition.</span> </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/7-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>When He had called all the multitude to <i>Himself,</i> He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Hear Me, everyone, and</span> <span class="woj">understand:</span> </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/7-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span><span class="woj">because it does not enter his heart but his stomach, and is eliminated,</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span><span class="woj"><i>thus</i> purifying all foods?&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/7-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And He said, <span class="woj">&#8220;What comes out of a man, that defiles a man.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/7-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span><span class="woj">For from within, out of the heart of men,</span> <span class="woj">proceed evil thoughts,</span> <span class="woj">adulteries,</span> <span class="woj">fornications, murders,</span> </span>

A Gentile Shows Her Faith</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-7-24"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/7-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>From there He arose and went to the region of Tyre <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>and Sidon.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/7-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>For a woman whose young daughter had an unclean spirit heard about Him, and she came and fell at His feet. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/7-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>The woman was a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>Greek, a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>Syro-Phoenician by birth, and she kept <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span>asking Him to cast the demon out of her daughter. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/7-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>But Jesus said to her, <span class="woj">&#8220;Let the children be filled first, for it is not good to take the children&#8217;s bread and throw <i>it</i> to the little dogs.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/7-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And she answered and said to Him, &#8220;Yes, Lord, yet even the little dogs under the table eat from the children&#8217;s crumbs.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/7-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Then He said to her, <span class="woj">&#8220;For this saying go your way; the demon has gone out of your daughter.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/7-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And when she had come to her house, she found the demon gone out, and her daughter lying on the bed.</span></p> <h3>
Jesus Heals a Deaf-Mute</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-7-31"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/7-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Again, departing from the region of Tyre and Sidon, He came through the midst of the region of Decapolis to the Sea of Galilee. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/7-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Then they brought to Him one who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech, and they begged Him to put His hand on him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/7-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And He took him aside from the multitude, and put His fingers in his ears, and He spat and touched his tongue. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/7-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Then, looking up to heaven, He sighed, and said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;Ephphatha,&#8221;</span> that is, <span class="woj">&#8220;Be opened.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/7-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Immediately his ears were opened, and the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[l]</a></span>impediment of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke plainly. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/7-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Then He commanded them that they should tell no one; but the more He commanded them, the more widely they proclaimed <i>it.</i> </span>
