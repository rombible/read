<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/14-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>But they said, &#8220;Not during the feast, lest there be an uproar of the people.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
The Anointing at Bethany</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-14-3"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/14-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And being in Bethany at the house of Simon the leper, as He sat at the table, a woman came having an alabaster flask of very costly <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>oil of spikenard.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/14-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But there were some who were indignant among themselves, and said, &#8220;Why was this fragrant oil wasted? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/14-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For it might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor.&#8221; And they criticized<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> her sharply.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/14-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But Jesus said, <span class="woj">&#8220;Let her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a good work for Me.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/14-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span><span class="woj">For you have the poor with you always, and whenever you wish you may do them good;</span> <span class="woj">but Me you do not have always.</span> </span>

Judas Agrees to Betray Jesus</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-14-10"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/14-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests to betray Him to them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/14-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And when they heard <i>it,</i> they were glad, and promised to give him money. So he sought how he might conveniently betray Him.</span></p> <h3>
Jesus Celebrates the Passover with His Disciples</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-14-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/14-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread, when they <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>killed the Passover <i>lamb,</i> His disciples said to Him, &#8220;Where do You want us to go and prepare, that You may eat the Passover?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/14-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And He sent out two of His disciples and said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Go into the city, and a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water; follow him.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/14-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span><span class="woj">Wherever he goes in, say to the master of the house, &#8216;The Teacher says, &#8220;Where is the guest room in which I may eat the Passover with My disciples?&#8221; &#8217;</span> </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/14-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And they began to be sorrowful, and to say to Him one by one, &#8220;<i>Is</i> it I?&#8221; <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>And another <i>said,</i> &#8220;<i>Is</i> it I?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/14-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>He answered and said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;<i>It is</i> one of the twelve, who dips with Me in the dish.</span> </span>

Jesus Institutes the Lord&#8217;s Supper</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-14-22"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/14-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed and broke <i>it,</i> and gave <i>it</i> to them and said, <span class="woj">&#8220;Take,</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span><span class="woj">eat; this is My</span> <span class="woj">body.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/14-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Then He took the cup, and when He had given thanks He gave <i>it</i> to them, and they all drank from it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/14-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;This is My blood of the</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span><span class="woj">new covenant, which is shed for many.</span> </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/14-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Jesus said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;Assuredly, I say to you that today, <i>even</i> this night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny Me three times.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/14-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>But he spoke more vehemently, &#8220;If I have to die with You, I will not deny You!&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Mark-14-31">And they all said likewise.</span></p> <h3>
The Prayer in the Garden</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-14-32"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/14-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Then they came to a place which was named Gethsemane; and He said to His disciples, <span class="woj">&#8220;Sit here while I pray.&#8221;</span> </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/14-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span>Then they laid their hands on Him and took Him. </span>
