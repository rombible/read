Jesus Transfigured on the Mount</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-9-2"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Now after six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John, and led them up on a high mountain apart by themselves; and He was transfigured before them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>His clothes became shining, exceedingly white, like snow, such as no launderer on earth can whiten them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And Elijah appeared to them with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then Peter answered and said to Jesus, &#8220;Rabbi, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tabernacles: one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah&#8221;&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>because he did not know what to say, for they were greatly afraid.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And a cloud came and overshadowed them; and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, &#8220;This is My beloved Son. Hear Him!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Suddenly, when they had looked around, they saw no one anymore, but only Jesus with themselves.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Now as they came down from the mountain, He commanded them that they should tell no one the things they had seen, till the Son of Man had risen from the dead. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So they kept this word to themselves, questioning what the rising from the dead meant.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And they asked Him, saying, &#8220;Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then He answered and told them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Indeed, Elijah is coming first and restores all things. And</span> <span class="woj">how is it written concerning the Son of Man, that He must suffer many things and</span> <span class="woj">be treated with contempt?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span><span class="woj">But I say to you that</span> <span class="woj">Elijah has also come, and they did to him whatever they wished, as it is written of him.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
A Boy Is Healed</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-9-14"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And when He came to the disciples, He saw a great multitude around them, and scribes disputing with them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Immediately, when they saw Him, all the people were greatly amazed, and running to <i>Him,</i> greeted Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And He asked the scribes, <span class="woj">&#8220;What are you discussing with them?&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then one of the crowd answered and said, &#8220;Teacher, I brought You my son, who has a mute spirit. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And wherever it seizes him, it throws him down; he foams at the mouth, gnashes his teeth, and becomes rigid. So I spoke to Your disciples, that they should cast it out, but they could not.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>He answered him and said, <span class="woj">&#8220;O</span> <span class="woj">faithless</span><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span> <span class="woj">generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span><span class="woj">bear with you? Bring him to Me.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then they brought him to Him. And when he saw Him, immediately the spirit convulsed him, and he fell on the ground and wallowed, foaming at the mouth.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>So He asked his father, <span class="woj">&#8220;How long has this been happening to him?&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span class="text Mark-9-21">And he said, &#8220;From childhood. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And often he has thrown him both into the fire and into the water to destroy him. But if You can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Jesus said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;If</span><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span> <span class="woj">you can believe, all things <i>are</i> possible to him who believes.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Immediately the father of the child cried out and said with tears, &#8220;Lord, I believe; help my unbelief!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>When Jesus saw that the people came running together, He rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, <span class="woj">&#8220;Deaf and dumb spirit, I command you, come out of him and enter him no more!&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Then <i>the spirit</i> cried out, convulsed him greatly, and came out of him. And he became as one dead, so that many said, &#8220;He is dead.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he arose.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And when He had come into the house, His disciples asked Him privately, &#8220;Why could we not cast it out?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>So He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;This kind can come out by nothing but</span> <span class="woj">prayer</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span><span class="woj">and fasting.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Jesus Again Predicts His Death and Resurrection</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-9-30"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Then they departed from there and passed through Galilee, and He did not want anyone to know <i>it.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>For He taught His disciples and said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;The Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of men, and they will</span> <span class="woj">kill Him. And after He is killed, He will</span> <span class="woj">rise the third day.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>But they did not understand this saying, and were afraid to ask Him.</span></p> <h3>
Who Is the Greatest?</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-9-33"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Then He came to Capernaum. And when He was in the house He asked them, <span class="woj">&#8220;What was it you</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span><span class="woj">disputed among yourselves on the road?&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>But they kept silent, for on the road they had disputed among themselves who <i>would be the</i> greatest. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>And He sat down, called the twelve, and said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;If anyone desires to be first, he shall be last of all and servant of all.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Then He took a little child and set him in the midst of them. And when He had taken him in His arms, He said to them, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;Whoever receives one of these little children in My name receives Me; and</span> <span class="woj">whoever receives Me, receives not Me but Him who sent Me.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Jesus Forbids Sectarianism</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-9-38"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>Now John answered Him, saying, &#8220;Teacher, we saw someone who does not follow us casting out demons in Your name, and we forbade him because he does not follow us.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>But Jesus said, <span class="woj">&#8220;Do not forbid him,</span> <span class="woj">for no one who works a miracle in My name can soon afterward speak evil of Me.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span><span class="woj">For</span> <span class="woj">he who is not against</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span><span class="woj">us is on</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span><span class="woj">our side.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span><span class="woj">For whoever gives you a cup of water to drink in My name, because you belong to Christ, assuredly, I say to you, he will by no means lose his reward.</span></span></p> <h3>
