<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So they watched Him closely, whether He would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>accuse Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And He said to the man who had the withered hand, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;Step forward.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?&#8221;</span> But they kept silent. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And when He had looked around at them with anger, being grieved by the hardness of their hearts, He said to the man, <span class="woj">&#8220;Stretch out your hand.&#8221;</span> And he stretched <i>it</i> out, and his hand was restored <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>as whole as the other. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then the Pharisees went out and immediately plotted with the Herodians against Him, how they might destroy Him.</span></p> <h3>
A Great Multitude Follows Jesus</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-3-7"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But Jesus withdrew with His disciples to the sea. And a great multitude from Galilee followed Him, and from Judea </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>and Jerusalem and Idumea and beyond the Jordan; and those from Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they heard how many things He was doing, came to Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So He told His disciples that a small boat should be kept ready for Him because of the multitude, lest they should crush Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For He healed many, so that as many as had afflictions pressed about Him to touch Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And the unclean spirits, whenever they saw Him, fell down before Him and cried out, saying, &#8220;You are the Son of God.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But He sternly warned them that they should not make Him known.</span></p> <h3>
The Twelve Apostles</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-3-13"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And He went up on the mountain and called to <i>Him</i> those He Himself wanted. And they came to Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then He appointed twelve, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>that they might be with Him and that He might send them out to preach, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and to have <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>power <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>to heal sicknesses and to cast out demons: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>Simon, to whom He gave the name Peter; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>James the <i>son</i> of Zebedee and John the brother of James, to whom He gave the name Boanerges, that is, &#8220;Sons of Thunder&#8221;; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the <i>son</i> of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Cananite; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him. And they went into a house.</span></p> <h3>
A House Divided Cannot Stand</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-3-20"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then the multitude came together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>But when His own people heard <i>about this,</i> they went out to lay hold of Him, for they said, &#8220;He is out of His mind.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, &#8220;He has Beelzebub,&#8221; and, &#8220;By the ruler of the demons He casts out demons.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>So He called them to <i>Himself</i> and said to them in parables: <span class="woj">&#8220;How can Satan cast out Satan?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span><span class="woj">If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span><span class="woj">And if a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span><span class="woj">And if Satan has risen up against himself, and is divided, he cannot stand, but has an end.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span><span class="woj">No one can enter a strong man&#8217;s house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man. And then he will plunder his house.</span></span></p> <h3>
The Unpardonable Sin</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-3-28"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;Assuredly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they may utter;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span><span class="woj">but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is subject to eternal condemnation&#8221;</span>&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>because they said, &#8220;He has an unclean spirit.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Jesus&#8217; Mother and Brothers Send for Him</span></h3><p><span class="text Mark-3-31"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Then His brothers and His mother came, and standing outside they sent to Him, calling Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And a multitude was sitting around Him; and they said to Him, &#8220;Look, Your mother and Your brothers <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>are outside seeking You.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>But He answered them, saying, <span class="woj">&#8220;Who is My mother, or My brothers?&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>And He looked around in a circle at those who sat about Him, and said, <span class="woj">&#8220;Here are My mother and My brothers!</span> </span>
