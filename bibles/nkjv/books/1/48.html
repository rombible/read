<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Jacob was told, &#8220;Look, your son Joseph is coming to you&#8221;; and Israel <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>strengthened himself and sat up on the bed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then Jacob said to Joseph: &#8220;God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and said to me, &#8216;Behold, I will make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will make of you a multitude of people, and give this land to your descendants after you <i>as</i> an everlasting possession.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And now your two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, <i>are</i> mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Your <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>offspring <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>whom you beget after them shall be yours; they will be called by the name of their brothers in their inheritance. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died beside me in the land of Canaan on the way, when <i>there was</i> but a little distance to go to Ephrath; and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then Israel saw Joseph&#8217;s sons, and said, &#8220;Who <i>are</i> these?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Joseph said to his father, &#8220;They <i>are</i> my sons, whom God has given me in this <i>place.</i>&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-48-9">And he said, &#8220;Please bring them to me, and I will bless them.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Now the eyes of Israel were dim with age, <i>so that</i> he could not see. Then Joseph brought them near him, and he kissed them and embraced them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And Israel said to Joseph, &#8220;I had not thought to see your face; but in fact, God has also shown me your offspring!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So Joseph brought them from beside his knees, and he bowed down with his face to the earth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And Joseph took them both, Ephraim with his right hand toward Israel&#8217;s left hand, and Manasseh with his left hand toward Israel&#8217;s right hand, and brought <i>them</i> near him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then Israel stretched out his right hand and laid <i>it</i> on Ephraim&#8217;s head, who <i>was</i> the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh&#8217;s head, guiding his hands knowingly, for Manasseh <i>was</i> the firstborn. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And he blessed Joseph, and said:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Gen-48-15">&#8220;God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked,</span><br /><span class="text Gen-48-15">The God who has fed me all my life long to this day,</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>The Angel who has redeemed me from all evil,</span><br /><span class="text Gen-48-16">Bless the lads;</span><br /><span class="text Gen-48-16">Let my name be named upon them,</span><br /><span class="text Gen-48-16">And the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac;</span><br /><span class="text Gen-48-16">And let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.&#8221;</span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Now when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it displeased him; so he took hold of his father&#8217;s hand to remove it from Ephraim&#8217;s head to Manasseh&#8217;s head. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And Joseph said to his father, &#8220;Not so, my father, for this <i>one is</i> the firstborn; put your right hand on his head.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>But his father refused and said, &#8220;I know, my son, I know. He also shall become a people, and he also shall be great; but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his descendants shall become a multitude of nations.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So he blessed them that day, saying, &#8220;By you Israel will bless, saying, &#8216;May God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh!&#8217; &#8221; And thus he set Ephraim before Manasseh.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then Israel said to Joseph, &#8220;Behold, I am dying, but God will be with you and bring you back to the land of your fathers. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Moreover I have given to you one <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>portion above your brothers, which I took from the hand of the Amorite with my sword and my bow.&#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-1454a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 48:2">Genesis 48:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Collected his strength</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1458b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 48:6">Genesis 48:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>children</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1458c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 48:6">Genesis 48:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Who are born to you</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1474d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 48:22">Genesis 48:22</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>shoulder</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
