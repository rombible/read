<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/20-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Now Abraham said of Sarah his wife, &#8220;She <i>is</i> my sister.&#8221; And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/20-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, &#8220;Indeed you <i>are</i> a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken, for she <i>is</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>a man&#8217;s wife.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/20-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But Abimelech had not come near her; and he said, &#8220;Lord, will You slay a righteous nation also? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/20-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Did he not say to me, &#8216;She <i>is</i> my sister&#8217;? And she, even she herself said, &#8216;He <i>is</i> my brother.&#8217; In the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>integrity of my heart and innocence of my hands I have done this.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/20-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And God said to him in a dream, &#8220;Yes, I know that you did this in the integrity of your heart. For I also withheld you from sinning against Me; therefore I did not let you touch her. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/20-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now therefore, restore the man&#8217;s wife; for he <i>is</i> a prophet, and he will pray for you and you shall live. But if you do not restore <i>her,</i> know that you shall surely die, you and all who <i>are</i> yours.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/20-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So Abimelech rose early in the morning, called all his servants, and told all these things in their hearing; and the men were very much afraid. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/20-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, &#8220;What have you done to us? How have I <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>offended you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? You have done deeds to me that ought not to be done.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/20-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then Abimelech said to Abraham, &#8220;What did you have in view, that you have done this thing?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/20-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And Abraham said, &#8220;Because I thought, surely the fear of God <i>is</i> not in this place; and they will kill me on account of my wife. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/20-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But indeed <i>she is</i> truly my sister. She <i>is</i> the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/20-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father&#8217;s house, that I said to her, &#8216;This <i>is</i> your kindness that you should do for me: in every place, wherever we go, say of me, &#8220;He <i>is</i> my brother.&#8221; &#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/20-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then Abimelech took sheep, oxen, and male and female servants, and gave <i>them</i> to Abraham; and he restored Sarah his wife to him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/20-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And Abimelech said, &#8220;See, my land <i>is</i> before you; dwell where it pleases you.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/20-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then to Sarah he said, &#8220;Behold, I have given your brother a thousand <i>pieces</i> of silver; indeed this <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>vindicates you before all who <i>are</i> with you and before everybody.&#8221; Thus she was <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>rebuked.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/20-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So Abraham prayed to God; and God healed Abimelech, his wife, and his female servants. Then they bore <i>children;</i> </span>
