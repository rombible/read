<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/47-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he took five men from among his brothers and presented them to Pharaoh. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/47-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then Pharaoh said to his brothers, &#8220;What <i>is</i> your occupation?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-47-3">And they said to Pharaoh, &#8220;Your servants <i>are</i> shepherds, both we <i>and</i> also our fathers.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/47-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And they said to Pharaoh, &#8220;We have come to dwell in the land, because your servants have no pasture for their flocks, for the famine <i>is</i> severe in the land of Canaan. Now therefore, please let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/47-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, &#8220;Your father and your brothers have come to you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/47-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>The land of Egypt <i>is</i> before you. Have your father and brothers dwell in the best of the land; let them dwell in the land of Goshen. And if you know <i>any</i> competent men among them, then make them chief herdsmen over my livestock.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/47-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then Joseph brought in his father Jacob and set him before Pharaoh; and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/47-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Pharaoh said to Jacob, &#8220;How old <i>are</i> you?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/47-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And Jacob said to Pharaoh, &#8220;The days of the years of my <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>pilgrimage <i>are</i> one hundred and thirty years; few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/47-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/47-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And Joseph situated his father and his brothers, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/47-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then Joseph provided his father, his brothers, and all his father&#8217;s household with bread, according to the number in <i>their</i> families.</span></p> <h3>
Joseph Deals with the Famine</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-47-13"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/47-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Now <i>there was</i> no bread in all the land; for the famine <i>was</i> very severe, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished because of the famine. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/47-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought; and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh&#8217;s house.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/47-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So when the money failed in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, &#8220;Give us bread, for why should we die in your presence? For the money has failed.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/47-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then Joseph said, &#8220;Give your livestock, and I will give you <i>bread</i> for your livestock, if the money is gone.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/47-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them bread <i>in exchange</i> for the horses, the flocks, the cattle of the herds, and for the donkeys. Thus he <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>fed them with bread <i>in exchange</i> for all their livestock that year.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/47-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>When that year had ended, they came to him the next year and said to him, &#8220;We will not hide from my lord that our money is gone; my lord also has our herds of livestock. There is nothing left in the sight of my lord but our bodies and our lands. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/47-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants of Pharaoh; give <i>us</i> seed, that we may live and not die, that the land may not be desolate.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/47-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for every man of the Egyptians sold his field, because the famine was severe upon them. So the land became Pharaoh&#8217;s. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/47-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And as for the people, he <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>moved them into the cities, from <i>one</i> end of the borders of Egypt to the <i>other</i> end. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/47-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Only the land of the priests he did not buy; for the priests had rations <i>allotted to them</i> by Pharaoh, and they ate their rations which Pharaoh gave them; therefore they did not sell their lands.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/47-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Then Joseph said to the people, &#8220;Indeed I have bought you and your land this day for Pharaoh. Look, <i>here is</i> seed for you, and you shall sow the land. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/47-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And it shall come to pass in the harvest that you shall give one-fifth to Pharaoh. Four-fifths shall be your own, as seed for the field and for your food, for those of your households and as food for your little ones.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/47-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>So they said, &#8220;You have saved our lives; let us find favor in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh&#8217;s servants.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/47-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt to this day, <i>that</i> Pharaoh should have one-fifth, except for the land of the priests only, <i>which</i> did not become Pharaoh&#8217;s.</span></p> <h3>
Joseph&#8217;s Vow to Jacob</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-47-27"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/47-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>So Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions there and grew and multiplied exceedingly. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/47-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. So the length of Jacob&#8217;s life was one hundred and forty-seven years. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/47-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>When the time drew near that Israel must die, he called his son Joseph and said to him, &#8220;Now if I have found favor in your sight, please put your hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me. Please do not bury me in Egypt, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/47-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>but let me lie with my fathers; you shall carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burial place.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-47-30">And he said, &#8220;I will do as you have said.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/47-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Then he said, &#8220;Swear to me.&#8221; And he swore to him. So Israel bowed himself on the head of the bed.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-1430a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 47:9">Genesis 47:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>sojourning</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1438b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 47:17">Genesis 47:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>supplied</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1442c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 47:21">Genesis 47:21</span> <span class='footnote-text'>So with MT, Tg.; Sam., LXX, Vg. <i>made the people virtual slaves</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
