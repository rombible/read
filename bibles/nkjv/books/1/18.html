<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So he lifted his eyes and looked, and behold, three men were standing by him; and when he saw <i>them,</i> he ran from the tent door to meet them, and bowed himself to the ground, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and said, &#8220;My Lord, if I have now found favor in Your sight, do not pass on by Your servant. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Please let a little water be brought, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And I will bring a morsel of bread, that you may refresh your hearts. After that you may pass by, inasmuch as you have come to your servant.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-18-5">They said, &#8220;Do as you have said.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah and said, &#8220;Quickly, make ready three measures of fine meal; knead <i>it</i> and make cakes.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And Abraham ran to the herd, took a tender and good calf, gave <i>it</i> to a young man, and he hastened to prepare it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So he took butter and milk and the calf which he had prepared, and set <i>it</i> before them; and he stood by them under the tree as they ate.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then they said to him, &#8220;Where <i>is</i> Sarah your wife?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-18-9">So he said, &#8220;Here, in the tent.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And He said, &#8220;I will certainly return to you according to the time of life, and behold, Sarah your wife shall have a son.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-18-10">(Sarah was listening in the tent door which <i>was</i> behind him.) </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now Abraham and Sarah were old, well advanced in age; <i>and</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>Sarah had passed the age of childbearing. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, &#8220;After I have grown old, shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Abraham, &#8220;Why did Sarah laugh, saying, &#8216;Shall I surely bear <i>a child,</i> since I am old?&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Is anything too hard for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>? At the appointed time I will return to you, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But Sarah denied <i>it,</i> saying, &#8220;I did not laugh,&#8221; for she was afraid.</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-18-15">And He said, &#8220;No, but you did laugh!&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Abraham Intercedes for Sodom</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-18-16"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then the men rose from there and looked toward Sodom, and Abraham went with them to send them on the way. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said, &#8220;Shall I hide from Abraham what I am doing, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>since Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>For I have known him, in order that he may command his children and his household after him, that they keep the way of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, to do righteousness and justice, that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> may bring to Abraham what He has spoken to him.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said, &#8220;Because the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grave, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>I will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according to the outcry against it that has come to Me; and if not, I will know.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then the men turned away from there and went toward Sodom, but Abraham still stood before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And Abraham came near and said, &#8220;Would You also destroy the righteous with the wicked? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Suppose there were fifty righteous within the city; would You also destroy the place and not spare <i>it</i> for the fifty righteous that were in it? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Far be it from You to do such a thing as this, to slay the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous should be as the wicked; far be it from You! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said, &#8220;If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Then Abraham answered and said, &#8220;Indeed now, I who <i>am</i> <i>but</i> dust and ashes have taken it upon myself to speak to the Lord: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Suppose there were five less than the fifty righteous; would You destroy all of the city for <i>lack of</i> five?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-18-28">So He said, &#8220;If I find there forty-five, I will not destroy <i>it.</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And he spoke to Him yet again and said, &#8220;Suppose there should be forty found there?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-18-29">So He said, &#8220;I will not do <i>it</i> for the sake of forty.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Then he said, &#8220;Let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Suppose thirty should be found there?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-18-30">So He said, &#8220;I will not do <i>it</i> if I find thirty there.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;Indeed now, I have taken it upon myself to speak to the Lord: Suppose twenty should be found there?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-18-31">So He said, &#8220;I will not destroy <i>it</i> for the sake of twenty.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Then he said, &#8220;Let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak but once more: Suppose ten should be found there?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-18-32">And He said, &#8220;I will not destroy <i>it</i> for the sake of ten.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> went His way as soon as He had finished speaking with Abraham; and Abraham returned to his place.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-426a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 18:1">Genesis 18:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. <i>Alon Mamre</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-436b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 18:11">Genesis 18:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>the manner of women had ceased to be with Sarah</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
