<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/29-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he looked, and saw a well in the field; and behold, there <i>were</i> three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks. A large stone <i>was</i> on the well&#8217;s mouth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/29-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Now all the flocks would be gathered there; and they would roll the stone from the well&#8217;s mouth, water the sheep, and put the stone back in its place on the well&#8217;s mouth.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/29-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And Jacob said to them, &#8220;My brethren, where <i>are</i> you from?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-29-4">And they said, &#8220;We <i>are</i> from Haran.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/29-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then he said to them, &#8220;Do you know Laban the son of Nahor?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-29-5">And they said, &#8220;We know him.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/29-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So he said to them, &#8220;Is he well?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-29-6">And they said, &#8220;<i>He is</i> well. And look, his daughter Rachel is coming with the sheep.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/29-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then he said, &#8220;Look, <i>it is</i> still <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>high day; <i>it is</i> not time for the cattle to be gathered together. Water the sheep, and go and feed <i>them.</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/29-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But they said, &#8220;We cannot until all the flocks are gathered together, and they have rolled the stone from the well&#8217;s mouth; then we water the sheep.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/29-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Now while he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father&#8217;s sheep, for she was a shepherdess. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/29-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother&#8217;s brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother&#8217;s brother, that Jacob went near and rolled the stone from the well&#8217;s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother&#8217;s brother. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/29-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice and wept. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/29-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And Jacob told Rachel that he <i>was</i> her father&#8217;s relative and that he <i>was</i> Rebekah&#8217;s son. So she ran and told her father.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/29-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then it came to pass, when Laban heard the report about Jacob his sister&#8217;s son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him and kissed him, and brought him to his house. So he told Laban all these things. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/29-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And Laban said to him, &#8220;Surely you <i>are</i> my bone and my flesh.&#8221; And he stayed with him for a month.</span></p> <h3>
Jacob Marries Leah and Rachel</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-29-15"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/29-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then Laban said to Jacob, &#8220;Because you <i>are</i> my relative, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what <i>should</i> your wages <i>be?</i>&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/29-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Now Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder <i>was</i> Leah, and the name of the younger <i>was</i> Rachel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/29-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Leah&#8217;s eyes <i>were</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>delicate, but Rachel was beautiful of form and appearance.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/29-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Now Jacob loved Rachel; so he said, &#8220;I will serve you seven years for Rachel your younger daughter.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/29-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And Laban said, &#8220;<i>It is</i> better that I give her to you than that I should give her to another man. Stay with me.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/29-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed <i>only</i> a few days to him because of the love he had for her.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/29-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then Jacob said to Laban, &#8220;Give <i>me</i> my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in to her.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/29-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And Laban gathered together all the men of the place and made a feast. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/29-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Now it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter and brought her to Jacob; and he went in to her. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/29-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And Laban gave his maid Zilpah to his daughter Leah <i>as</i> a maid. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/29-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>So it came to pass in the morning, that behold, it <i>was</i> Leah. And he said to Laban, &#8220;What is this you have done to me? Was it not for Rachel that I served you? Why then have you deceived me?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/29-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And Laban said, &#8220;It must not be done so in our <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>country, to give the younger before the firstborn. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/29-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Fulfill her week, and we will give you this one also for the service which you will serve with me still another seven years.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/29-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then Jacob did so and fulfilled her week. So he gave him his daughter Rachel as wife also. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/29-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And Laban gave his maid Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as a maid. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/29-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Then <i>Jacob</i> also went in to Rachel, and he also loved Rachel more than Leah. And he served with Laban still another seven years.</span></p> <h3>
The Children of Jacob</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-29-31"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/29-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>When the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> saw that Leah <i>was</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>unloved, He opened her womb; but Rachel <i>was</i> barren. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/29-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>So Leah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>Reuben; for she said, &#8220;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has surely looked on my affliction.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/29-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Then she conceived again and bore a son, and said, &#8220;Because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has heard that I <i>am</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>unloved, He has therefore given me this <i>son</i> also.&#8221; And she called his name <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>Simeon. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/29-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>She conceived again and bore a son, and said, &#8220;Now this time my husband will become attached to me, because I have borne him three sons.&#8221; Therefore his name was called <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>Levi. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/29-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>And she conceived again and bore a son, and said, &#8220;Now I will praise the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221; Therefore she called his name Judah.<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span> Then she stopped bearing.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-803a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 29:7">Genesis 29:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>early in the day</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-813b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 29:17">Genesis 29:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>weak</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-822c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 29:26">Genesis 29:26</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>place</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-827d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 29:31">Genesis 29:31</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>hated</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-828e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 29:32">Genesis 29:32</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>See, a Son</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-829f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 29:33">Genesis 29:33</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>hated</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-829g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 29:33">Genesis 29:33</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Heard</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-830h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 29:34">Genesis 29:34</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Attached</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-831i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 29:35">Genesis 29:35</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Praise</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
