<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/42-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;Indeed I have heard that there is grain in Egypt; go down to that place and buy for us there, that we may live and not die.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/42-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So Joseph&#8217;s ten brothers went down to buy grain in Egypt. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/42-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But Jacob did not send Joseph&#8217;s brother Benjamin with his brothers, for he said, &#8220;Lest some calamity befall him.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/42-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And the sons of Israel went to buy <i>grain</i> among those who journeyed, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/42-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now Joseph <i>was</i> governor over the land; and it was he who sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph&#8217;s brothers came and bowed down before him with <i>their</i> faces to the earth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/42-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Joseph saw his brothers and recognized them, but he acted as a stranger to them and spoke <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>roughly to them. Then he said to them, &#8220;Where do you come from?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-42-7">And they said, &#8220;From the land of Canaan to buy food.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/42-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/42-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then Joseph remembered the dreams which he had dreamed about them, and said to them, &#8220;You <i>are</i> spies! You have come to see the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>nakedness of the land!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/42-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And they said to him, &#8220;No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy food. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/42-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>We <i>are</i> all one man&#8217;s sons; we <i>are</i> honest <i>men;</i> your servants are not spies.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/42-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But he said to them, &#8220;No, but you have come to see the nakedness of the land.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/42-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And they said, &#8220;Your servants <i>are</i> twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and in fact, the youngest <i>is</i> with our father today, and one <i>is</i> no more.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/42-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But Joseph said to them, &#8220;It <i>is</i> as I spoke to you, saying, &#8216;You <i>are</i> spies!&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/42-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>In this <i>manner</i> you shall be tested: By the life of Pharaoh, you shall not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/42-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Send one of you, and let him bring your brother; and you shall be <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>kept in prison, that your words may be tested to see whether <i>there is</i> any truth in you; or else, by the life of Pharaoh, surely you <i>are</i> spies!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/42-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So he <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>put them all together in prison three days.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/42-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then Joseph said to them the third day, &#8220;Do this and live, <i>for</i> I fear God: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/42-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>If you <i>are</i> honest <i>men,</i> let one of your brothers be confined to your prison house; but you, go and carry grain for the famine of your houses. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/42-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And bring your youngest brother to me; so your words will be verified, and you shall not die.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-42-20">And they did so. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/42-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then they said to one another, &#8220;We <i>are</i> truly guilty concerning our brother, for we saw the anguish of his soul when he pleaded with us, and we would not hear; therefore this distress has come upon us.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/42-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And Reuben answered them, saying, &#8220;Did I not speak to you, saying, &#8216;Do not sin against the boy&#8217;; and you would not listen? Therefore behold, his blood is now required of us.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/42-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>But they did not know that Joseph understood <i>them,</i> for he spoke to them through an interpreter. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/42-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And he turned himself away from them and wept. Then he returned to them again, and talked with them. And he took Simeon from them and bound him before their eyes.</span></p> <h3>
The Brothers Return to Canaan</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-42-25"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/42-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then Joseph gave a command to fill their sacks with grain, to restore every man&#8217;s money to his sack, and to give them provisions for the journey. Thus he did for them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/42-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>So they loaded their donkeys with the grain and departed from there. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/42-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>But as one <i>of them</i> opened his sack to give his donkey feed at the encampment, he saw his money; and there it was, in the mouth of his sack. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/42-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>So he said to his brothers, &#8220;My money has been restored, and there it is, in my sack!&#8221; Then their hearts <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>failed <i>them</i> and they were afraid, saying to one another, &#8220;What <i>is</i> this <i>that</i> God has done to us?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/42-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Then they went to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan and told him all that had happened to them, saying: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/42-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>&#8220;The man <i>who is</i> lord of the land spoke <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/42-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>But we said to him, &#8216;We <i>are</i> honest <i>men;</i> we are not spies. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/42-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>We <i>are</i> twelve brothers, sons of our father; one <i>is</i> no <i>more,</i> and the youngest <i>is</i> with our father this day in the land of Canaan.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/42-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Then the man, the lord of the country, said to us, &#8216;By this I will know that you <i>are</i> honest <i>men:</i> Leave one of your brothers <i>here</i> with me, take <i>food for</i> the famine of your households, and be gone. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/42-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>And bring your youngest brother to me; so I shall know that you <i>are</i> not spies, but <i>that</i> you <i>are</i> honest <i>men.</i> I will grant your brother to you, and you may trade in the land.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/42-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Then it happened as they emptied their sacks, that surprisingly each man&#8217;s bundle of money <i>was</i> in his sack; and when they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/42-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>And Jacob their father said to them, &#8220;You have bereaved me: Joseph is no <i>more,</i> Simeon is no <i>more,</i> and you want to take Benjamin. All these things are against me.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/42-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>Then Reuben spoke to his father, saying, &#8220;Kill my two sons if I do not bring him <i>back</i> to you; put him in my hands, and I will bring him back to you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/42-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>But he said, &#8220;My son shall not go down with you, for his brother is dead, and he is left alone. If any calamity should befall him along the way in which you go, then you would bring down my gray hair with sorrow to the grave.&#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-1260a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 42:7">Genesis 42:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>harshly</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1262b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 42:9">Genesis 42:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Exposed parts</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1269c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 42:16">Genesis 42:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>bound</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1270d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 42:17">Genesis 42:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>gathered</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1281e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 42:28">Genesis 42:28</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>sank</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1283f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 42:30">Genesis 42:30</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>harshly</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
