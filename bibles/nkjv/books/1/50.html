<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. So the physicians embalmed Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Forty days were required for him, for such are the days required for those who are embalmed; and the Egyptians mourned<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span> for him seventy days.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Now when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spoke to the household of Pharaoh, saying, &#8220;If now I have found favor in your eyes, please speak in the hearing of Pharaoh, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8216;My father made me swear, saying, &#8220;Behold, I am dying; in my grave which I dug for myself in the land of Canaan, there you shall bury me.&#8221; Now therefore, please let me go up and bury my father, and I will come back.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And Pharaoh said, &#8220;Go up and bury your father, as he made you swear.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>as well as all the house of Joseph, his brothers, and his father&#8217;s house. Only their little ones, their flocks, and their herds they left in the land of Goshen. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen, and it was a very great gathering.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which <i>is</i> beyond the Jordan, and they mourned there with a great and very solemn lamentation. He observed seven days of mourning for his father. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, &#8220;This <i>is</i> a deep mourning of the Egyptians.&#8221; Therefore its name was called <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>Abel Mizraim, which <i>is</i> beyond the Jordan.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So his sons did for him just as he had commanded them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For his sons carried him to the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, before Mamre, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite as property for a burial place. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And after he had buried his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brothers and all who went up with him to bury his father.</span></p> <h3>
Joseph Reassures His Brothers</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-50-15"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>When Joseph&#8217;s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, &#8220;Perhaps Joseph will hate us, and may <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>actually repay us for all the evil which we did to him.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So they sent <i>messengers</i> to Joseph, saying, &#8220;Before your father died he commanded, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>&#8216;Thus you shall say to Joseph: &#8220;I beg you, please forgive the trespass of your brothers and their sin; for they did evil to you.&#8221; &#8217; Now, please, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of your father.&#8221; And Joseph wept when they spoke to him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then his brothers also went and fell down before his face, and they said, &#8220;Behold, we <i>are</i> your servants.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Joseph said to them, &#8220;Do not be afraid, for <i>am</i> I in the place of God? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>But as for you, you meant evil against me; <i>but</i> God meant it for good, in order to bring it about as <i>it is</i> this day, to save many people alive. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Now therefore, do not be afraid; I will provide for you and your little ones.&#8221; And he comforted them and spoke <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>kindly to them.</span></p> <h3>
Death of Joseph</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-50-22"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he and his father&#8217;s household. And Joseph lived one hundred and ten years. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Joseph saw Ephraim&#8217;s children to the third <i>generation.</i> The children of Machir, the son of Manasseh, were also brought up on Joseph&#8217;s knees.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And Joseph said to his brethren, &#8220;I am dying; but God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land to the land of which He swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then Joseph took an oath from the children of Israel, saying, &#8220;God will surely <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>So Joseph died, <i>being</i> one hundred and ten years old; and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-1510a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 50:3">Genesis 50:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>wept</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1518b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 50:11">Genesis 50:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Mourning of Egypt</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1522c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 50:15">Genesis 50:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>fully</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1528d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 50:21">Genesis 50:21</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>to their hearts</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1532e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 50:25">Genesis 50:25</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>give attention to</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
