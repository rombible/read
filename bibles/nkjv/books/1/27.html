<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then he said, &#8220;Behold now, I am old. I do not know the day of my death. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Now therefore, please take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt game for me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And make me <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>savory food, such as I love, and bring <i>it</i> to me that I may eat, that my soul may bless you before I die.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now Rebekah was listening when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt game and to bring <i>it.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, &#8220;Indeed I heard your father speak to Esau your brother, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8216;Bring me game and make <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>savory food for me, that I may eat it and bless you in the presence of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> before my death.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to what I command you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Go now to the flock and bring me from there two choice kids of the goats, and I will make savory food from them for your father, such as he loves. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then you shall take <i>it</i> to your father, that he may eat <i>it,</i> and that he may bless you before his death.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, &#8220;Look, Esau my brother <i>is</i> a hairy man, and I <i>am</i> a smooth-<i>skinned</i> man. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Perhaps my father will feel me, and I shall seem to be a deceiver to him; and I shall bring a curse on myself and not a blessing.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>But his mother said to him, &#8220;<i>Let</i> your curse <i>be</i> on me, my son; only obey my voice, and go, get <i>them</i> for me.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And he went and got <i>them</i> and brought <i>them</i> to his mother, and his mother made <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>savory food, such as his father loved. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then Rebekah took the choice clothes of her elder son Esau, which <i>were</i> with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And she put the skins of the kids of the goats on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then she gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>So he went to his father and said, &#8220;My father.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-27-18">And he said, &#8220;Here I am. Who <i>are</i> you, my son?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Jacob said to his father, &#8220;I <i>am</i> Esau your firstborn; I have done just as you told me; please arise, sit and eat of my game, that your soul may bless me.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>But Isaac said to his son, &#8220;How <i>is it</i> that you have found <i>it</i> so quickly, my son?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-27-20">And he said, &#8220;Because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God brought <i>it</i> to me.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Isaac said to Jacob, &#8220;Please come near, that I may feel you, my son, whether you <i>are</i> really my son Esau or not.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So Jacob went near to Isaac his father, and he felt him and said, &#8220;The voice <i>is</i> Jacob&#8217;s voice, but the hands <i>are</i> the hands of Esau.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And he did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau&#8217;s hands; so he blessed him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then he said, &#8220;<i>Are</i> you really my son Esau?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-27-24">He said, &#8220;I <i>am.</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>He said, &#8220;Bring <i>it</i> near to me, and I will eat of my son&#8217;s game, so that my soul may bless you.&#8221; So he brought <i>it</i> near to him, and he ate; and he brought him wine, and he drank. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Then his father Isaac said to him, &#8220;Come near now and kiss me, my son.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And he came near and kissed him; and he smelled the smell of his clothing, and blessed him and said:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Gen-27-27">&#8220;Surely, the smell of my son</span><br /><span class="text Gen-27-27"><i>Is</i> like the smell of a field</span><br /><span class="text Gen-27-27">Which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has blessed.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Therefore may God give you</span><br /><span class="text Gen-27-28">Of the dew of heaven,</span><br /><span class="text Gen-27-28">Of the fatness of the earth,</span><br /><span class="text Gen-27-28">And plenty of grain and wine.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Let peoples serve you,</span><br /><span class="text Gen-27-29">And nations bow down to you.</span><br /><span class="text Gen-27-29">Be master over your brethren,</span><br /><span class="text Gen-27-29">And let your mother&#8217;s sons bow down to you.</span><br /><span class="text Gen-27-29">Cursed <i>be</i> everyone who curses you,</span><br /><span class="text Gen-27-29">And blessed <i>be</i> those who bless you!&#8221;</span></p></div> <h3>
Esau&#8217;s Lost Hope</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-27-30"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Now it happened, as soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, and Jacob had scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>He also had made <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>savory food, and brought it to his father, and said to his father, &#8220;Let my father arise and eat of his son&#8217;s game, that your soul may bless me.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And his father Isaac said to him, &#8220;Who <i>are</i> you?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-27-32">So he said, &#8220;I <i>am</i> your son, your firstborn, Esau.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Then Isaac trembled exceedingly, and said, &#8220;Who? Where <i>is</i> the one who hunted game and brought <i>it</i> to me? I ate all <i>of it</i> before you came, and I have blessed him&#8212;<i>and</i> indeed he shall be blessed.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with an exceedingly great and bitter cry, and said to his father, &#8220;Bless me&#8212;me also, O my father!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>But he said, &#8220;Your brother came with deceit and has taken away your blessing.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>And <i>Esau</i> said, &#8220;Is he not rightly named <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>Jacob? For he has supplanted me these two times. He took away my birthright, and now look, he has taken away my blessing!&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Have you not reserved a blessing for me?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>Then Isaac answered and said to Esau, &#8220;Indeed I have made him your master, and all his brethren I have given to him as servants; with grain and wine I have <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>sustained him.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>And Esau said to his father, &#8220;Have you only one blessing, my father? Bless me&#8212;me also, O my father!&#8221; And Esau lifted up his voice and wept.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>Then Isaac his father answered and said to him:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Gen-27-39">&#8220;Behold, your dwelling shall be of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>fatness of the earth,</span><br /><span class="text Gen-27-39">And of the dew of heaven from above.</span><br />

Jacob Escapes from Esau</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-27-41"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>So Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed him, and Esau said in his heart, &#8220;The days of mourning for my father <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>are at hand; then I will kill my brother Jacob.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>And the words of Esau her older son were told to Rebekah.
