<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>When Jacob saw them, he said, &#8220;This <i>is</i> God&#8217;s camp.&#8221; And he called the name of that place <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>Mahanaim.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother in the land of Seir, the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>country of Edom. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And he commanded them, saying, &#8220;Speak thus to my lord Esau, &#8216;Thus your servant Jacob says: &#8220;I have dwelt with Laban and stayed there until now. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, and male and female servants; and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in your sight.&#8221; &#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, &#8220;We came to your brother Esau, and he also is coming to meet you, and four hundred men <i>are</i> with him.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed; and he divided the people that <i>were</i> with him, and the flocks and herds and camels, into two companies. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;If Esau comes to the one company and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>attacks it, then the other company which is left will escape.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then Jacob said, &#8220;O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> who said to me, &#8216;Return to your country and to your family, and I will deal well with you&#8217;: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies and of all the truth which You have shown Your servant; for I crossed over this Jordan with my staff, and now I have become two companies. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Deliver me, I pray, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him, lest he come and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>attack me <i>and</i> the mother with the children. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>For You said, &#8216;I will surely treat you well, and make your descendants as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So he lodged there that same night, and took what <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>came to his hand as a present for Esau his brother: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>thirty milk camels with their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten foals. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then he delivered <i>them</i> to the hand of his servants, every drove by itself, and said to his servants, &#8220;Pass over before me, and put some distance between successive droves.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And he commanded the first one, saying, &#8220;When Esau my brother meets you and asks you, saying, &#8216;To whom do you belong, and where are you going? Whose <i>are</i> these in front of you?&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>then you shall say, &#8216;They <i>are</i> your servant Jacob&#8217;s. It <i>is</i> a present sent to my lord Esau; and behold, he also <i>is</i> behind us.&#8217; &#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>So he commanded the second, the third, and all who followed the droves, saying, &#8220;In this manner you shall speak to Esau when you find him; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>and also say, &#8216;Behold, your servant Jacob <i>is</i> behind us.&#8217; &#8221; For he said, &#8220;I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face; perhaps he will accept me.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>So the present went on over before him, but he himself lodged that night in the camp.</span></p> <h3>
Wrestling with God</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-32-22"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And he arose that night and took his two wives, his two female servants, and his eleven sons, and crossed over the ford of Jabbok. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>He took them, sent them <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>over the brook, and sent over what he had. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then Jacob was left alone; and a Man wrestled with him until the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>breaking of day. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Now when He saw that He did not prevail against him, He <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>touched the socket of his hip; and the socket of Jacob&#8217;s hip was out of joint as He wrestled with him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And He said, &#8220;Let Me go, for the day breaks.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-32-26">But he said, &#8220;I will not let You go unless You bless me!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>So He said to him, &#8220;What <i>is</i> your name?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-32-27">He said, &#8220;Jacob.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And He said, &#8220;Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>Israel; for you have struggled with God and with men, and have prevailed.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Then Jacob asked, saying, &#8220;Tell <i>me</i> Your name, I pray.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-32-29">And He said, &#8220;Why <i>is</i> it <i>that</i> you ask about My name?&#8221; And He blessed him there.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>So Jacob called the name of the place <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>Peniel: &#8220;For I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Just as he crossed over <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span>Penuel the sun rose on him, and he limped on his hip. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Therefore to this day the children of Israel do not eat the muscle that shrank, which <i>is</i> on the hip socket, because He <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[l]</a></span>touched the socket of Jacob&#8217;s hip in the muscle that shrank.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-931a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 32:2">Genesis 32:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Double Camp</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-932b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 32:3">Genesis 32:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>field</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-937c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 32:8">Genesis 32:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>strikes</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-940d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 32:11">Genesis 32:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>strike</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-942e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 32:13">Genesis 32:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>he had received</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-952f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 32:23">Genesis 32:23</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>across</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-953g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 32:24">Genesis 32:24</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>dawn</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-954h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 32:25">Genesis 32:25</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>struck</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-957i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 32:28">Genesis 32:28</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Prince with God</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-959j"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 32:30">Genesis 32:30</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Face of God</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-960k"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 32:31">Genesis 32:31</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Face of God;</i> same as <i>Peniel,</i> v. <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Gen.32.30" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=Gen.32.30&amp;version=NKJV">30</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-961l"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 32:32">Genesis 32:32</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>struck</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
