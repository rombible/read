And Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines, in Gerar.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/26-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> appeared to him and said: &#8220;Do not go down to Egypt; live in the land of which I shall tell you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/26-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Dwell in this land, and I will be with you and bless you; for to you and your descendants I give all these lands, and I will perform the oath which I swore to Abraham your father. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/26-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And I will make your descendants multiply as the stars of heaven; I will give to your descendants all these lands; and in your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/26-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>because Abraham obeyed My voice and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/26-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So Isaac dwelt in Gerar. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/26-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And the men of the place asked about his wife. And he said, &#8220;She <i>is</i> my sister&#8221;; for he was afraid to say, &#8220;<i>She is</i> my wife,&#8221; <i>because he thought,</i> &#8220;lest the men of the place kill me for Rebekah, because she <i>is</i> beautiful to behold.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/26-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Now it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked through a window, and saw, and there was Isaac, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>showing endearment to Rebekah his wife. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/26-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then Abimelech called Isaac and said, &#8220;Quite obviously she <i>is</i> your wife; so how could you say, &#8216;She <i>is</i> my sister&#8217;?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-26-9">Isaac said to him, &#8220;Because I said, &#8216;Lest I die on account of her.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/26-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And Abimelech said, &#8220;What <i>is</i> this you have done to us? One of the people might soon have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/26-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So Abimelech charged all <i>his</i> people, saying, &#8220;He who touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/26-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then Isaac sowed in that land, and reaped in the same year a hundredfold; and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> blessed him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/26-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>The man began to prosper, and continued prospering until he became very prosperous; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/26-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>for he had possessions of flocks and possessions of herds and a great number of servants. So the Philistines envied him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/26-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Now the Philistines had stopped up all the wells which his father&#8217;s servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, and they had filled them with earth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/26-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And Abimelech said to Isaac, &#8220;Go away from us, for you are much mightier than we.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/26-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then Isaac departed from there and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>pitched his tent in the Valley of Gerar, and dwelt there. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/26-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And Isaac dug again the wells of water which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father, for the Philistines had stopped them up after the death of Abraham. He called them by the names which his father had called them.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/26-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Also Isaac&#8217;s servants dug in the valley, and found a well of running water there. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/26-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>But the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac&#8217;s herdsmen, saying, &#8220;The water <i>is</i> ours.&#8221; So he called the name of the well <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Esek, because they quarreled with him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/26-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then they dug another well, and they quarreled over that <i>one</i> also. So he called its name <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>Sitnah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/26-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And he moved from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it. So he called its name <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>Rehoboth, because he said, &#8220;For now the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/26-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Then he went up from there to Beersheba. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/26-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> appeared to him the same night and said, &#8220;I <i>am</i> the God of your father Abraham; do not fear, for I <i>am</i> with you. I will bless you and multiply your descendants for My servant Abraham&#8217;s sake.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/26-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>So he built an altar there and called on the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and he pitched his tent there; and there Isaac&#8217;s servants dug a well.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/26-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Then Abimelech came to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath, one of his friends, and Phichol the commander of his army. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/26-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And Isaac said to them, &#8220;Why have you come to me, since you hate me and have sent me away from you?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/26-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>But they said, &#8220;We have certainly seen that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> is with you. So we said, &#8216;Let there now be an oath between us, between you and us; and let us make a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>covenant with you, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/26-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>that you will do us no harm, since we have not touched you, and since we have done nothing to you but good and have sent you away in peace. You <i>are</i> now the blessed of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/26-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>So he made them a feast, and they ate and drank. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/26-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Then they arose early in the morning and swore an oath with one another; and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/26-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>It came to pass the same day that Isaac&#8217;s servants came and told him about the well which they had dug, and said to him, &#8220;We have found water.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/26-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>So he called it <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>Shebah. Therefore the name of the city <i>is</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>Beersheba to this day.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/26-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>When Esau was forty years old, he took as wives Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/26-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>And they were a grief of mind to Isaac and Rebekah.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-701a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 26:8">Genesis 26:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>caressing</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-710b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 26:17">Genesis 26:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>camped</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-713c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 26:20">Genesis 26:20</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Quarrel</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-714d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 26:21">Genesis 26:21</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Enmity</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-715e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 26:22">Genesis 26:22</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Spaciousness</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-721f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 26:28">Genesis 26:28</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>treaty</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-726g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 26:33">Genesis 26:33</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Oath</i> or <i>Seven</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-726h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 26:33">Genesis 26:33</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Well of the Oath</i> or <i>Well of the Seven</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
