<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Abram <i>was</i> very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And he went on his journey from the South as far as Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>to the place of the altar which he had made there at first. And there Abram called on the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks and herds and tents. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now the land was not able to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>support them, that they might dwell together, for their possessions were so great that they could not dwell together. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram&#8217;s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot&#8217;s livestock. The Canaanites and the Perizzites then dwelt in the land.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So Abram said to Lot, &#8220;Please let there be no strife between you and me, and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen; for we <i>are</i> brethren. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span><i>Is</i> not the whole land before you? Please separate from me. If <i>you take</i> the left, then I will go to the right; or, if <i>you go</i> to the right, then I will go to the left.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And Lot lifted his eyes and saw all the plain of Jordan, that it <i>was</i> well watered everywhere (before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah) like the garden of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, like the land of Egypt as you go toward Zoar. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then Lot chose for himself all the plain of Jordan, and Lot journeyed east. And they separated from each other. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the cities of the plain and pitched <i>his</i> tent even as far as Sodom. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>But the men of Sodom <i>were</i> exceedingly wicked and sinful against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Abram, after Lot had separated from him: &#8220;Lift your eyes now and look from the place where you are&#8212;northward, southward, eastward, and westward; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>for all the land which you see I give to you and your <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>descendants forever. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And I will make your descendants as the dust of the earth; so that if a man could number the dust of the earth, <i>then</i> your descendants also could be numbered. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Arise, walk in the land through its length and its width, for I give it to you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then Abram moved <i>his</i> tent, and went and dwelt by <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>the terebinth trees of Mamre, which <i>are</i> in Hebron, and built an altar there to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-320a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 13:1">Genesis 13:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. <i>Negev</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-325b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 13:6">Genesis 13:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>bear</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-334c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 13:15">Genesis 13:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>seed</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-337d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 13:18">Genesis 13:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. <i>Alon Mamre</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
