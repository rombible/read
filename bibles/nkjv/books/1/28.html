<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/28-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Arise, go to Padan Aram, to the house of Bethuel your mother&#8217;s father; and take yourself a wife from there of the daughters of Laban your mother&#8217;s brother.</span></p> <div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/28-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8220;May God Almighty bless you,</span><br /><span class="text Gen-28-3">And make you fruitful and multiply you,</span><br /><span class="text Gen-28-3">That you may be an assembly of peoples;</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/28-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And give you the blessing of Abraham,</span><br /><span class="text Gen-28-4">To you and your descendants with you,</span><br /><span class="text Gen-28-4">That you may inherit the land</span><br /><span class="text Gen-28-4">In<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span> which you are a stranger,</span><br /><span class="text Gen-28-4">Which God gave to Abraham.&#8221;</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/28-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So Isaac sent Jacob away, and he went to Padan Aram, to Laban the son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau.</span></p> <h3>
Esau Marries Mahalath</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-28-6"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/28-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Padan Aram to take himself a wife from there, <i>and that</i> as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, &#8220;You shall not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan,&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/28-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and that Jacob had obeyed his father and his mother and had gone to Padan Aram. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/28-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Also Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan did not please his father Isaac. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/28-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So Esau went to Ishmael and took Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham&#8217;s son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife in addition to the wives he had.</span></p> <h3>
Jacob&#8217;s Vow at Bethel</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-28-10"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/28-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Now Jacob went out from Beersheba and went toward Haran. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/28-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So he came to a certain place and stayed there all night, because the sun had set. And he took one of the stones of that place and put it at his head, and he lay down in that place to sleep. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/28-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then he dreamed, and behold, a ladder <i>was</i> set up on the earth, and its top reached to heaven; and there the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/28-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And behold, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> stood above it and said: &#8220;I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac; the land on which you lie I will give to you and your descendants. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/28-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Also your descendants shall be as the dust of the earth; you shall spread abroad to the west and the east, to the north and the south; and in you and in your seed all the families of the earth shall be blessed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/28-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Behold, I <i>am</i> with you and will keep<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land; for I will not leave you until I have done what I have spoken to you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/28-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, &#8220;Surely the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> is in this place, and I did not know <i>it.</i>&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/28-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And he was afraid and said, &#8220;How awesome <i>is</i> this place! This <i>is</i> none other than the house of God, and this <i>is</i> the gate of heaven!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/28-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then Jacob rose early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put at his head, set it up as a pillar, and poured oil on top of it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/28-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And he called the name of that place <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>Bethel; but the name of that city had been Luz previously. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/28-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then Jacob made a vow, saying, &#8220;If God will be with me, and keep me in this way that I am going, and give me bread to eat and clothing to put on, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/28-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>so that I come back to my father&#8217;s house in peace, then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> shall be my God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/28-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And this stone which I have set as a pillar shall be God&#8217;s house, and of all that You give me I will surely give a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>tenth to You.&#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-775a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 28:1">Genesis 28:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>commanded</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-778b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 28:4">Genesis 28:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Of your sojournings</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-789c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 28:15">Genesis 28:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>protect</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-793d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 28:19">Genesis 28:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>House of God</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-796e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 28:22">Genesis 28:22</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>tithe</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
