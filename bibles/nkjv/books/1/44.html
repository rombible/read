<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/44-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Also put my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the sack of the youngest, and his grain money.&#8221; So he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/44-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>As soon as the morning dawned, the men were sent away, they and their donkeys. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/44-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>When they had gone out of the city, <i>and</i> were not <i>yet</i> far off, Joseph said to his steward, &#8220;Get up, follow the men; and when you overtake them, say to them, &#8216;Why have you repaid evil for good? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/44-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span><i>Is</i> not this <i>the one</i> from which my lord drinks, and with which he indeed practices divination? You have done evil in so doing.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/44-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So he overtook them, and he spoke to them these same words. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/44-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And they said to him, &#8220;Why does my lord say these words? Far be it from us that your servants should do such a thing. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/44-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Look, we brought back to you from the land of Canaan the money which we found in the mouth of our sacks. How then could we steal silver or gold from your lord&#8217;s house? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/44-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>With whomever of your servants it is found, let him die, and we also will be my lord&#8217;s slaves.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/44-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;Now also <i>let</i> it <i>be</i> according to your words; he with whom it is found shall be my slave, and you shall be blameless.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/44-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then each man speedily let down his sack to the ground, and each opened his sack. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/44-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So he searched. He began with the oldest and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>left off with the youngest; and the cup was found in Benjamin&#8217;s sack. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/44-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then they tore their clothes, and each man loaded his donkey and returned to the city.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/44-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So Judah and his brothers came to Joseph&#8217;s house, and he <i>was</i> still there; and they fell before him on the ground. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/44-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And Joseph said to them, &#8220;What deed <i>is</i> this you have done? Did you not know that such a man as I can certainly practice divination?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/44-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then Judah said, &#8220;What shall we say to my lord? What shall we speak? Or how shall we clear ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants; here we are, my lord&#8217;s slaves, both we and <i>he</i> also with whom the cup was found.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/44-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But he said, &#8220;Far be it from me that I should do so; the man in whose hand the cup was found, he shall be my slave. And as for you, go up in peace to your father.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Judah Intercedes for Benjamin</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-44-18"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/44-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then Judah came near to him and said: &#8220;O my lord, please let your servant speak a word in my lord&#8217;s hearing, and do not let your anger burn against your servant; for you <i>are</i> even like Pharaoh. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/44-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>My lord asked his servants, saying, &#8216;Have you a father or a brother?&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/44-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And we said to my lord, &#8216;We have a father, an old man, and a child of <i>his</i> old age, <i>who is</i> young; his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother&#8217;s children, and his father loves him.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/44-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then you said to your servants, &#8216;Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes on him.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/44-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And we said to my lord, &#8216;The lad cannot leave his father, for <i>if</i> he should leave his father, <i>his father</i> would die.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/44-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>But you said to your servants, &#8216;Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you shall see my face no more.&#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/44-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>&#8220;So it was, when we went up to your servant my father, that we told him the words of my lord. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/44-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And our father said, &#8216;Go back <i>and</i> buy us a little food.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/44-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>But we said, &#8216;We cannot go down; if our youngest brother is with us, then we will go down; for we may not see the man&#8217;s face unless our youngest brother <i>is</i> with us.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/44-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Then your servant my father said to us, &#8216;You know that my wife bore me two sons; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/44-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>and the one went out from me, and I said, &#8220;Surely he is torn to pieces&#8221;; and I have not seen him since. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/44-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>But if you take this one also from me, and calamity befalls him, you shall bring down my gray hair with sorrow to the grave.&#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/44-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>&#8220;Now therefore, when I come to your servant my father, and the lad <i>is</i> not with us, since his life is bound up in the lad&#8217;s life, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/44-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>it will happen, when he sees that the lad <i>is</i> not <i>with us,</i> that he will die. So your servants will bring down the gray hair of your servant our father with sorrow to the grave. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/44-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>For your servant became surety for the lad to my father, saying, &#8216;If I do not bring him <i>back</i> to you, then I shall bear the blame before my father forever.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/44-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Now therefore, please let your servant remain instead of the lad as a slave to my lord, and let the lad go up with his brothers. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/44-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>For how shall I go up to my father if the lad <i>is</i> not with me, lest perhaps I see the evil that would <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>come upon my father?&#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-1326a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 44:1">Genesis 44:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>the one over</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1337b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 44:12">Genesis 44:12</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>finished with</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1359c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 44:34">Genesis 44:34</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>find</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
