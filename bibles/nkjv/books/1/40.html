<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief butler and the chief baker. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the prison, the place where Joseph <i>was</i> confined. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them; so they were in custody for a while.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, who <i>were</i> confined in the prison, had a dream, both of them, each man&#8217;s dream in one night <i>and</i> each man&#8217;s dream with its <i>own</i> interpretation. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And Joseph came in to them in the morning and looked at them, and saw that they <i>were</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>sad. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So he asked Pharaoh&#8217;s officers who <i>were</i> with him in the custody of his lord&#8217;s house, saying, &#8220;Why do you look <i>so</i> sad today?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And they said to him, &#8220;We each have had a dream, and <i>there is</i> no interpreter of it.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-40-8">So Joseph said to them, &#8220;Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell <i>them</i> to me, please.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, &#8220;Behold, in my dream a vine <i>was</i> before me, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and in the vine <i>were</i> three branches; it <i>was</i> as though it budded, its blossoms shot forth, and its clusters brought forth ripe grapes. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then Pharaoh&#8217;s cup <i>was</i> in my hand; and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh&#8217;s cup, and placed the cup in Pharaoh&#8217;s hand.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And Joseph said to him, &#8220;This <i>is</i> the interpretation of it: The three branches <i>are</i> three days. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Now within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>place, and you will put Pharaoh&#8217;s cup in his hand according to the former manner, when you were his butler. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But remember me when it is well with you, and please show kindness to me; make mention of me to Pharaoh, and get me out of this house. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>For indeed I was stolen away from the land of the Hebrews; and also I have done nothing here that they should put me into the dungeon.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, &#8220;I also <i>was</i> in my dream, and there <i>were</i> three <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>white baskets on my head. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>In the uppermost basket <i>were</i> all kinds of baked goods for Pharaoh, and the birds ate them out of the basket on my head.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>So Joseph answered and said, &#8220;This <i>is</i> the interpretation of it: The three baskets <i>are</i> three days. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Within three days Pharaoh will lift <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>off your head from you and hang you on a tree; and the birds will eat your flesh from you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Now it came to pass on the third day, <i>which was</i> Pharaoh&#8217;s birthday, that he made a feast for all his servants; and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then he restored the chief butler to his butlership again, and he placed the cup in Pharaoh&#8217;s hand. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Yet the chief butler did not remember Joseph, but forgot him.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-1179a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 40:6">Genesis 40:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>dejected</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1186b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 40:13">Genesis 40:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>position</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1189c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 40:16">Genesis 40:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>baskets of white bread</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1192d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 40:19">Genesis 40:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>up</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
