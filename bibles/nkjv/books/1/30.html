<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Jacob&#8217;s anger was aroused against Rachel, and he said, &#8220;<i>Am</i> I in the place of God, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So she said, &#8220;Here is my maid Bilhah; go in to her, and she will bear <i>a child</i> on my knees, that I also may <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>have children by her.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then she gave him Bilhah her maid as wife, and Jacob went in to her. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then Rachel said, &#8220;God has judged my case; and He has also heard my voice and given me a son.&#8221; Therefore she called his name <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>Dan. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And Rachel&#8217;s maid Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then Rachel said, &#8220;With <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>great wrestlings I have wrestled with my sister, <i>and</i> indeed I have prevailed.&#8221; So she called his name <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>Naphtali.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>When Leah saw that she had stopped bearing, she took Zilpah her maid and gave her to Jacob as wife. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And Leah&#8217;s maid Zilpah bore Jacob a son. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then Leah said, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>&#8220;A troop comes!&#8221; So she called his name <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>Gad. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And Leah&#8217;s maid Zilpah bore Jacob a second son. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then Leah said, &#8220;I am happy, for the daughters will call me blessed.&#8221; So she called his name <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>Asher.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Now Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, &#8220;Please give me <i>some</i> of your son&#8217;s mandrakes.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But she said to her, &#8220;<i>Is it</i> a small matter that you have taken away my husband? Would you take away my son&#8217;s mandrakes also?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-30-15">And Rachel said, &#8220;Therefore he will lie with you tonight for your son&#8217;s mandrakes.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>When Jacob came out of the field in the evening, Leah went out to meet him and said, &#8220;You must come in to me, for I have surely hired you with my son&#8217;s mandrakes.&#8221; And he lay with her that night.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And God listened to Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Leah said, &#8220;God has given me my wages, because I have given my maid to my husband.&#8221; So she called his name <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>Issachar. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then Leah conceived again and bore Jacob a sixth son. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And Leah said, &#8220;God has endowed me <i>with</i> a good endowment; now my husband will dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons.&#8221; So she called his name <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>Zebulun. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Afterward she bore a daughter, and called her name <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>Dinah.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then God remembered Rachel, and God listened to her and opened her womb. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And she conceived and bore a son, and said, &#8220;God has taken away my reproach.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>So she called his name <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span>Joseph, and said, &#8220;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> shall add to me another son.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Jacob&#8217;s Agreement with Laban</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-30-25"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, &#8220;Send me away, that I may go to my own place and to my country. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Give <i>me</i> my wives and my children for whom I have served you, and let me go; for you know my service which I have done for you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And Laban said to him, &#8220;Please <i>stay,</i> if I have found favor in your eyes, <i>for</i> I have learned by experience that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has blessed me for your sake.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then he said, &#8220;Name me your wages, and I will give <i>it.</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>So <i>Jacob</i> said to him, &#8220;You know how I have served you and how your livestock has been with me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>For what you had before I <i>came was</i> little, and it has increased to a great amount; the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has blessed you <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[l]</a></span>since my coming. And now, when shall I also provide for my own house?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>So he said, &#8220;What shall I give you?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-30-31">And Jacob said, &#8220;You shall not give me anything. If you will do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep your flocks: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Let me pass through all your flock today, removing from there all the speckled and spotted sheep, and all the brown ones among the lambs, and the spotted and speckled among the goats; and <i>these</i> shall be my wages. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>So my righteousness will answer for me in time to come, when the subject of my wages comes before you: every one that <i>is</i> not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the lambs, will be considered stolen, if <i>it is</i> with me.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>And Laban said, &#8220;Oh, that it were according to your word!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>So he removed that day the male goats that were speckled and spotted, all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had <i>some</i> white in it, and all the brown ones among the lambs, and gave <i>them</i> into the hand of his sons. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Then he put three days&#8217; journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob fed the rest of Laban&#8217;s flocks.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>Now Jacob took for himself rods of green poplar and of the almond and chestnut trees, peeled white strips in them, and exposed the white which <i>was</i> in the rods. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>And the rods which he had peeled, he set before the flocks in the gutters, in the watering troughs where the flocks came to drink, so that they should conceive when they came to drink. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>So the flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks brought forth streaked, speckled, and spotted. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>Then Jacob separated the lambs, and made the flocks face toward the streaked and all the brown in the flock of Laban; but he put his own flocks by themselves and did not put them with Laban&#8217;s flock.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>And it came to pass, whenever the stronger livestock conceived, that Jacob placed the rods before the eyes of the livestock in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>But when the flocks were feeble, he did not put <i>them</i> in; so the feebler were Laban&#8217;s and the stronger Jacob&#8217;s. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>Thus the man became exceedingly prosperous, and had large flocks, female and male servants, and camels and donkeys.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-834a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 30:3">Genesis 30:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>be built up by her</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-837b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 30:6">Genesis 30:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Judge</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-839c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 30:8">Genesis 30:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>wrestlings of God</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-839d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 30:8">Genesis 30:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>My Wrestling</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-842e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 30:11">Genesis 30:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>So with Qr., Syr., Tg.; Kt., LXX, Vg. <i>in fortune</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-842f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 30:11">Genesis 30:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Troop</i> or <i>Fortune</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-844g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 30:13">Genesis 30:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Happy</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-849h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 30:18">Genesis 30:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Wages</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-851i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 30:20">Genesis 30:20</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Dwelling</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-852j"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 30:21">Genesis 30:21</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Judgment</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-855k"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 30:24">Genesis 30:24</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>He Will Add</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-861l"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 30:30">Genesis 30:30</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>at my foot</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
