<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be on every beast of the earth, on every bird of the air, on all that move <i>on</i> the earth, and on all the fish of the sea.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you. I have given you all things, even as the green herbs. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But you shall not eat flesh with its life, <i>that is,</i> its blood. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Surely for your lifeblood I will demand <i>a reckoning;</i> from the hand of every beast I will require it, and from the hand of man.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then God spoke to Noah and to his sons with him, saying: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;And as for Me, behold, I establish My covenant with you and with your <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>descendants after you, </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Thus I establish My covenant with you: Never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of the flood; never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And God said: &#8220;This <i>is</i> the sign of the covenant which I make between Me and you, and every living creature that <i>is</i> with you, for perpetual generations: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>I set My rainbow in the cloud, and it shall be for the sign of the covenant between Me and the earth. </span>
