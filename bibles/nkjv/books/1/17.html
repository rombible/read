<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And I will make My covenant between Me and you, and will multiply you exceedingly.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then Abram fell on his face, and God talked with him, saying: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8220;As for Me, behold, My covenant is with you, and you shall be a father of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>many nations. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>No longer shall your name be called <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Abram, but your name shall be <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>Abraham; for I have made you a father of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>many nations. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>I will make you exceedingly fruitful; and I will make nations of you, and kings shall come from you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you in their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and your descendants after you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Also I give to you and your descendants after you the land in<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span> which you are a stranger, all the land of Canaan, as an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And God said to Abraham: &#8220;As for you, you shall keep My covenant, you and your descendants after you throughout their generations. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>This <i>is</i> My covenant which you shall keep, between Me and you and your descendants after you: Every male child among you shall be circumcised; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>and you shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskins, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between Me and you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>He who is eight days old among you shall be circumcised, every male child in your generations, he who is born in your house or bought with money from any foreigner who is not your descendant. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>He who is born in your house and he who is bought with your money must be circumcised, and My covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And the uncircumcised male child, who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that person shall be cut off from his people; he has broken My covenant.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then God said to Abraham, &#8220;As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>Sarah <i>shall be</i> her name. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And I will bless her and also give you a son by her; then I will bless her, and she shall be <i>a mother</i> <i>of</i> nations; kings of peoples shall be from her.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said in his heart, &#8220;Shall <i>a child</i> be born to a man who is one hundred years old?

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And Abraham said to God, &#8220;Oh, that Ishmael might live before You!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then God said: &#8220;No, Sarah your wife shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name Isaac; I will establish My covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, <i>and</i> with his descendants after him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And as for Ishmael, I have heard you. Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly. He shall beget twelve princes, and I will make him a great nation. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>But My covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to you at this set time next year.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then He finished talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>So Abraham took Ishmael his son, all who were born in his house and all who were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham&#8217;s house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskins that very same day, as God had said to him. </span>
