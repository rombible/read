<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/16-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So Sarai said to Abram, &#8220;See now, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has restrained me from bearing <i>children.</i> Please, go in to my maid; perhaps I shall <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>obtain children by her.&#8221; And Abram heeded the voice of Sarai. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/16-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then Sarai, Abram&#8217;s wife, took Hagar her maid, the Egyptian, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/16-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So he went in to Hagar, and she conceived. And when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress became despised in her <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>eyes.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/16-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then Sarai said to Abram, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>&#8220;My wrong <i>be</i> upon you!

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/16-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So Abram said to Sarai, &#8220;Indeed your maid <i>is</i> in your hand; do to her as you please.&#8221; And when Sarai dealt harshly with her, she fled from her presence.</span></p> <p>
