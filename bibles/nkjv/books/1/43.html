<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/43-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the grain which they had brought from Egypt, that their father said to them, &#8220;Go back, buy us a little food.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/43-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But Judah spoke to him, saying, &#8220;The man solemnly warned us, saying, &#8216;You shall not see my face unless your brother <i>is</i> with you.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/43-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>If you send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you food. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/43-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But if you will not send <i>him,</i> we will not go down; for the man said to us, &#8216;You shall not see my face unless your brother <i>is</i> with you.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/43-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And Israel said, &#8220;Why did you deal <i>so</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>wrongfully with me <i>as</i> to tell the man whether you had still <i>another</i> brother?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/43-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But they said, &#8220;The man asked us pointedly about ourselves and our family, saying, &#8216;<i>Is</i> your father still alive? Have you <i>another</i> brother?&#8217; And we told him according to these words. Could we possibly have known that he would say, &#8216;Bring your brother down&#8217;?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/43-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then Judah said to Israel his father, &#8220;Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go, that we may live and not die, both we and you <i>and</i> also our little ones. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/43-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>I myself will be surety for him; from my hand you shall require him. If I do not bring him <i>back</i> to you and set him before you, then let me bear the blame forever. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/43-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For if we had not lingered, surely by now we would have returned this second time.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/43-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And their father Israel said to them, &#8220;If <i>it must be</i> so, then do this: Take some of the best fruits of the land in your vessels and carry down a present for the man&#8212;a little balm and a little honey, spices and myrrh, pistachio nuts and almonds. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/43-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Take double money in your hand, and take back in your hand the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks; perhaps it was an oversight. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/43-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Take your brother also, and arise, go back to the man. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/43-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And may God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may release your other brother and Benjamin. If I am bereaved, I am bereaved!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/43-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So the men took that present and Benjamin, and they took double money in their hand, and arose and went down to Egypt; and they stood before Joseph. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/43-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, &#8220;Take <i>these</i> men to my home, and slaughter <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>an animal and make ready; for <i>these</i> men will dine with me at noon.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/43-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then the man did as Joseph ordered, and the man brought the men into Joseph&#8217;s house.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/43-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Now the men were afraid because they were brought into Joseph&#8217;s house; and they said, &#8220;<i>It is</i> because of the money, which was returned in our sacks the first time, that we are brought in, so that he may <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>make a case against us and seize us, to take us as slaves with our donkeys.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/43-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>When they drew near to the steward of Joseph&#8217;s house, they talked with him at the door of the house, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/43-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>and said, &#8220;O sir, we indeed came down the first time to buy food; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/43-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>but it happened, when we came to the encampment, that we opened our sacks, and there, <i>each</i> man&#8217;s money <i>was</i> in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight; so we have brought it back in our hand. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/43-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And we have brought down other money in our hands to buy food. We do not know who put our money in our sacks.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/43-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>But he said, &#8220;Peace <i>be</i> with you, do not be afraid. Your God and the God of your father has given you treasure in your sacks; I had your money.&#8221; Then he brought Simeon out to them.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/43-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>So the man brought the men into Joseph&#8217;s house and gave <i>them</i> water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their donkeys feed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/43-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then they made the present ready for Joseph&#8217;s coming at noon, for they heard that they would eat bread there.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/43-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which <i>was</i> in their hand into the house, and bowed down before him to the earth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/43-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Then he asked them about <i>their</i> well-being, and said, &#8220;<i>Is</i> your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? <i>Is</i> he still alive?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/43-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And they answered, &#8220;Your servant our father <i>is</i> in good health; he <i>is</i> still alive.&#8221; And they bowed their heads down and prostrated themselves.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/43-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Then he lifted his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother&#8217;s son, and said, &#8220;<i>Is</i> this your younger brother of whom you spoke to me?&#8221; And he said, &#8220;God be gracious to you, my son.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/43-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Now his heart yearned for his brother; so Joseph made haste and sought <i>somewhere</i> to weep. And he went into <i>his</i> chamber and wept there. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/43-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Then he washed his face and came out; and he restrained himself, and said, &#8220;Serve the bread.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/43-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>So they set him a place by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves; because the Egyptians could not eat food with the Hebrews, for that <i>is</i> an abomination to the Egyptians. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/43-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth; and the men looked in astonishment at one another. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/43-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Then he took servings to them from before him, but Benjamin&#8217;s serving was five times as much as any of theirs. So they drank and were merry with him.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-1297a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 43:6">Genesis 43:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>wickedly</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1307b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 43:16">Genesis 43:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>a slaughter</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1309c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 43:18">Genesis 43:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>roll himself upon us</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
