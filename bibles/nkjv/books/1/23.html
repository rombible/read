<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/23-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So Sarah died in Kirjath Arba (that <i>is,</i> Hebron) in the land of Canaan, and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/23-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spoke to the sons of Heth, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/23-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8220;I <i>am</i> a foreigner and a visitor among you. Give me property for a burial place among you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/23-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And the sons of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/23-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>&#8220;Hear us, my lord: You <i>are</i> a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>mighty prince among us; bury your dead in the choicest of our burial places. None of us will withhold from you his burial place, that you may bury your dead.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/23-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then Abraham stood up and bowed himself to the people of the land, the sons of Heth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/23-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And he spoke with them, saying, &#8220;If it is your wish that I bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>meet with Ephron the son of Zohar for me, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/23-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>that he may give me the cave of Machpelah which he has, which <i>is</i> at the end of his field. Let him give it to me at the full price, as property for a burial place among you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/23-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Now Ephron dwelt among the sons of Heth; and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the presence of the sons of Heth, all who entered at the gate of his city, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/23-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8220;No, my lord, hear me: I give you the field and the cave that <i>is</i> in it; I give it to you in the presence of the sons of my people. I give it to you. Bury your dead!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/23-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/23-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>and he spoke to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, saying, &#8220;If you <i>will give it,</i> please hear me. I will give you money for the field; take <i>it</i> from me and I will bury my dead there.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/23-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/23-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>&#8220;My lord, listen to me; the land <i>is worth</i> four hundred shekels of silver. What <i>is</i> that between you and me? So bury your dead.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/23-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And Abraham listened to Ephron; and Abraham weighed out the silver for Ephron which he had named in the hearing of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, currency of the merchants.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/23-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So the field of Ephron which <i>was</i> in Machpelah, which <i>was</i> before Mamre, the field and the cave which <i>was</i> in it, and all the trees that <i>were</i> in the field, which <i>were</i> within all the surrounding borders, were deeded </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/23-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>to Abraham as a possession in the presence of the sons of Heth, before all who went in at the gate of his city.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/23-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah, before Mamre (that <i>is,</i> Hebron) in the land of Canaan. </span>
