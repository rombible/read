<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>that the sons of God saw the daughters of men, that they <i>were</i> beautiful; and they took wives for themselves of all whom they chose.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said, &#8220;My Spirit shall not strive<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span> with man forever, for he <i>is</i> indeed flesh; yet his days shall be one hundred and twenty years.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>There were <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>giants on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men and they bore <i>children</i> to them. Those <i>were</i> the mighty men who <i>were</i> of old, men of renown.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> saw that the wickedness of man <i>was</i> great in the earth, and <i>that</i> every intent<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span> of the thoughts of his heart <i>was</i> only evil <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>continually. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was sorry that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved in His heart. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said, &#8220;I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth, both man and beast, creeping thing and birds of the air, for I am sorry that I have made them.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But Noah found grace in the eyes of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.</span></p> <h3>
Noah Pleases God</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-6-9"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>This is the genealogy of Noah. Noah was a just man, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>perfect in his generations. Noah walked with God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And Noah begot three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So God looked upon the earth, and indeed it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth.</span></p> <h3>
The Ark Prepared</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-6-13"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And God said to Noah, &#8220;The end of all flesh has come before Me, for the earth is filled with violence through them; and behold, I will destroy them with the earth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Make yourself an ark of gopherwood; make <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>rooms in the ark, and cover it inside and outside with pitch. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And this is how you shall make it: The length of the ark <i>shall be</i> three hundred <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>cubits, its width fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>You shall make a window for the ark, and you shall finish it to a cubit from above; and set the door of the ark in its side. You shall make it <i>with</i> lower, second, and third <i>decks.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And behold, I Myself am bringing floodwaters on the earth, to destroy from under heaven all flesh in which <i>is</i> the breath of life; everything that <i>is</i> on the earth shall die. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>But I will establish My covenant with you; and you shall go into the ark&#8212;you, your sons, your wife, and your sons&#8217; wives with you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And of every living thing of all flesh you shall bring two of every <i>sort</i> into the ark, to keep <i>them</i> alive with you; they shall be male and female. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Of the birds after their kind, of animals after their kind, and of every creeping thing of the earth after its kind, two of every <i>kind</i> will come to you to keep <i>them</i> alive. </span>
