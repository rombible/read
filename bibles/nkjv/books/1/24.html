<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So Abraham said to the oldest servant of his house, who ruled over all that he had, &#8220;Please, put your hand under my thigh, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and I will make you swear<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span> by the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>but you shall go to my country and to my family, and take a wife for my son Isaac.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And the servant said to him, &#8220;Perhaps the woman will not be willing to follow me to this land. Must I take your son back to the land from which you came?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But Abraham said to him, &#8220;Beware that you do not take my son back there. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of heaven, who took me from my father&#8217;s house and from the land of my family, and who spoke to me and swore to me, saying, &#8216;To your <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>descendants I give this land,&#8217; He will send His angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son from there. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And if the woman is not willing to follow you, then you will be released from this oath; only do not take my son back there.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning this matter.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then the servant took ten of his master&#8217;s camels and departed, for all his master&#8217;s goods <i>were in</i> his hand. And he arose and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And he made his camels kneel down outside the city by a well of water at evening time, the time when women go out to draw <i>water.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then he said, &#8220;O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of my master Abraham, please give me success this day, and show kindness to my master Abraham. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Behold, <i>here</i> I stand by the well of water, and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Now let it be that the young woman to whom I say, &#8216;Please let down your pitcher that I may drink,&#8217; and she says, &#8216;Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink&#8217;&#8212;<i>let</i> her <i>be the one</i> You have appointed for Your servant Isaac. And by this I will know that You have shown kindness to my master.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And it happened, before he had finished speaking, that behold, Rebekah,<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham&#8217;s brother, came out with her pitcher on her shoulder. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Now the young woman <i>was</i> very beautiful to behold, a virgin; no man had known her. And she went down to the well, filled her pitcher, and came up. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And the servant ran to meet her and said, &#8220;Please let me drink a little water from your pitcher.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>So she said, &#8220;Drink, my lord.&#8221; Then she quickly let her pitcher down to her hand, and gave him a drink. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And when she had finished giving him a drink, she said, &#8220;I will draw <i>water</i> for your camels also, until they have finished drinking.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then she quickly emptied her pitcher into the trough, ran back to the well to draw <i>water,</i> and drew for all his camels. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And the man, wondering at her, remained silent so as to know whether the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had made his journey prosperous or not.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So it was, when the camels had finished drinking, that the man took a golden nose ring weighing half a shekel, and two bracelets for her wrists weighing ten <i>shekels</i> of gold, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>and said, &#8220;Whose daughter <i>are</i> you? Tell me, please, is there room <i>in</i> your father&#8217;s house for us <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>to lodge?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>So she said to him, &#8220;I <i>am</i> the daughter of Bethuel, Milcah&#8217;s son, whom she bore to Nahor.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Moreover she said to him, &#8220;We have both straw and feed enough, and room to lodge.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Then the man bowed down his head and worshiped the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;Blessed <i>be</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken His mercy and His truth toward my master. As for me, being on the way, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> led me to the house of my master&#8217;s brethren.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>So the young woman ran and told her mother&#8217;s household these things.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Now Rebekah had a brother whose name <i>was</i> Laban, and Laban ran out to the man by the well. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>So it came to pass, when he saw the nose ring, and the bracelets on his sister&#8217;s wrists, and when he heard the words of his sister Rebekah, saying, &#8220;Thus the man spoke to me,&#8221; that he went to the man. And there he stood by the camels at the well. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;Come in, O blessed of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>! Why do you stand outside? For I have prepared the house, and a place for the camels.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Then the man came to the house. And he unloaded the camels, and provided straw and feed for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who <i>were</i> with him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span><i>Food</i> was set before him to eat, but he said, &#8220;I will not eat until I have told about my errand.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-24-33">And he said, &#8220;Speak on.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>So he said, &#8220;I <i>am</i> Abraham&#8217;s servant. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has blessed my master greatly, and he has become great; and He has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, male and female servants, and camels and donkeys. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>And Sarah my master&#8217;s wife bore a son to my master when she was old; and to him he has given all that he has. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>Now my master made me swear, saying, &#8216;You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>but you shall go to my father&#8217;s house and to my family, and take a wife for my son.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>And I said to my master, &#8216;Perhaps the woman will not follow me.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>But he said to me, &#8216;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, before whom I walk, will send His angel with you and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>prosper your way; and you shall take a wife for my son from my family and from my father&#8217;s house. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>You will be clear from this oath when you arrive among my family; for if they will not give <i>her</i> to you, then you will be released from my oath.&#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>&#8220;And this day I came to the well and said, &#8216;O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of my master Abraham, if You will now prosper the way in which I go, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass that when the virgin comes out to draw <i>water,</i> and I say to her, &#8220;Please give me a little water from your pitcher to drink,&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>and she says to me, &#8220;Drink, and I will draw for your camels also,&#8221;&#8212;<i>let</i> her <i>be</i> the woman whom the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has appointed for my master&#8217;s son.&#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>&#8220;But before I had finished speaking in my heart, there was Rebekah, coming out with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down to the well and drew <i>water.</i> And I said to her, &#8216;Please let me drink.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span>And she made haste and let her pitcher down from her <i>shoulder,</i> and said, &#8216;Drink, and I will give your camels a drink also.&#8217; So I drank, and she gave the camels a drink also. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-47.htm"><b>47</b></a></span>Then I asked her, and said, &#8216;Whose daughter <i>are</i> you?&#8217; And she said, &#8216;The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor&#8217;s son, whom Milcah bore to him.&#8217; So I put the nose ring on her nose and the bracelets on her wrists. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-48.htm"><b>48</b></a></span>And I bowed my head and worshiped the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and blessed the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the way of truth to take the daughter of my master&#8217;s brother for his son. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-49.htm"><b>49</b></a></span>Now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me. And if not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand or to the left.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-50.htm"><b>50</b></a></span>Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, &#8220;The thing comes from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; we cannot speak to you either bad or good. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-51.htm"><b>51</b></a></span>Here <i>is</i> Rebekah before you; take <i>her</i> and go, and let her be your master&#8217;s son&#8217;s wife, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has spoken.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-52.htm"><b>52</b></a></span>And it came to pass, when Abraham&#8217;s servant heard their words, that he worshiped the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, <i>bowing himself</i> to the earth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-53.htm"><b>53</b></a></span>Then the servant brought out jewelry of silver, jewelry of gold, and clothing, and gave <i>them</i> to Rebekah. He also gave precious things to her brother and to her mother.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-54.htm"><b>54</b></a></span>And he and the men who <i>were</i> with him ate and drank and stayed all night. Then they arose in the morning, and he said, &#8220;Send me away to my master.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-55.htm"><b>55</b></a></span>But her brother and her mother said, &#8220;Let the young woman stay with us <i>a few</i> days, at least ten; after that she may go.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-56.htm"><b>56</b></a></span>And he said to them, &#8220;Do not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>hinder me, since the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has prospered my way; send me away so that I may go to my master.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-57.htm"><b>57</b></a></span>So they said, &#8220;We will call the young woman and ask her personally.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-58.htm"><b>58</b></a></span>Then they called Rebekah and said to her, &#8220;Will you go with this man?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-24-58">And she said, &#8220;I will go.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-59.htm"><b>59</b></a></span>So they sent away Rebekah their sister and her nurse, and Abraham&#8217;s servant and his men. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-60.htm"><b>60</b></a></span>And they blessed Rebekah and said to her:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Gen-24-60">&#8220;Our sister, <i>may</i> you <i>become</i></span><br /><span class="text Gen-24-60"><i>The mother of</i> thousands of ten thousands;</span><br /><span class="text Gen-24-60">And may your descendants possess</span><br /><span class="text Gen-24-60">The gates of those who hate them.&#8221;</span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-61.htm"><b>61</b></a></span>Then Rebekah and her maids arose, and they rode on the camels and followed the man. So the servant took Rebekah and departed.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-62.htm"><b>62</b></a></span>Now Isaac came from the way of Beer Lahai Roi, for he dwelt in the South. </span>
