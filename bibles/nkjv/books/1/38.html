<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/38-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name <i>was</i> Shua, and he married her and went in to her. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/38-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So she conceived and bore a son, and he called his name Er. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/38-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>She conceived again and bore a son, and she called his name Onan. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/38-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And she conceived yet again and bore a son, and called his name Shelah. He was at Chezib when she bore him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/38-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name <i>was</i> Tamar. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/38-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But Er, Judah&#8217;s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> killed him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/38-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And Judah said to Onan, &#8220;Go in to your brother&#8217;s wife and marry her, and raise up an heir to your brother.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/38-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But Onan knew that the heir would not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in to his brother&#8217;s wife, that he emitted on the ground, lest he should give an heir to his brother. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/38-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And the thing which he did <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>displeased the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; therefore He killed him also.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/38-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, &#8220;Remain a widow in your father&#8217;s house till my son Shelah is grown.&#8221; For he said, &#8220;Lest he also die like his brothers.&#8221; And Tamar went and dwelt in her father&#8217;s house.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/38-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now in the process of time the daughter of Shua, Judah&#8217;s wife, died; and Judah was comforted, and went up to his sheepshearers at Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/38-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And it was told Tamar, saying, &#8220;Look, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/38-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So she took off her widow&#8217;s garments, covered <i>herself</i> with a veil and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place which <i>was</i> on the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given to him as a wife. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/38-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>When Judah saw her, he thought she <i>was</i> a harlot, because she had covered her face. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/38-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then he turned to her by the way, and said, &#8220;Please let me come in to you&#8221;; for he did not know that she <i>was</i> his daughter-in-law.</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-38-16">So she said, &#8220;What will you give me, that you may come in to me?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/38-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;I will send a young goat from the flock.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-38-17">So she said, &#8220;Will you give <i>me</i> a pledge till you send <i>it?</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/38-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then he said, &#8220;What pledge shall I give you?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-38-18">So she said, &#8220;Your signet and cord, and your staff that <i>is</i> in your hand.&#8221; Then he gave <i>them</i> to her, and went in to her, and she conceived by him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/38-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>So she arose and went away, and laid aside her veil and put on the garments of her widowhood.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/38-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And Judah sent the young goat by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive <i>his</i> pledge from the woman&#8217;s hand, but he did not find her. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/38-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then he asked the men of that place, saying, &#8220;Where is the harlot who <i>was</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>openly by the roadside?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-38-21">And they said, &#8220;There was no harlot in this <i>place.</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/38-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So he returned to Judah and said, &#8220;I cannot find her. Also, the men of the place said there was no harlot in this <i>place.</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/38-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Then Judah said, &#8220;Let her take <i>them</i> for herself, lest we be shamed; for I sent this young goat and you have not found her.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/38-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And it came to pass, about three months after, that Judah was told, saying, &#8220;Tamar your daughter-in-law has played the harlot; furthermore she <i>is</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>with child by harlotry.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-38-24">So Judah said, &#8220;Bring her out and let her be burned!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/38-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>When she <i>was</i> brought out, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, &#8220;By the man to whom these belong, I <i>am</i> with child.&#8221; And she said, &#8220;Please determine whose these <i>are</i>&#8212;the signet and cord, and staff.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/38-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>So Judah acknowledged <i>them</i> and said, &#8220;She has been more righteous than I, because I did not give her to Shelah my son.&#8221; And he never knew her again.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/38-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Now it came to pass, at the time for giving birth, that behold, twins <i>were</i> in her womb. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/38-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And so it was, when she was giving birth, that <i>the one</i> put out <i>his</i> hand; and the midwife took a scarlet <i>thread</i> and bound it on his hand, saying, &#8220;This one came out first.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/38-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Then it happened, as he drew back his hand, that his brother came out unexpectedly; and she said, &#8220;How did you break through? <i>This</i> breach <i>be</i> upon you!&#8221; Therefore his name was called Perez.<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/38-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Afterward his brother came out who had the scarlet <i>thread</i> on his hand. And his name was called Zerah.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-1130a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 38:10">Genesis 38:10</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>was evil in the eyes of</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1141b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 38:21">Genesis 38:21</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>in full view</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1144c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 38:24">Genesis 38:24</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>pregnant</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1149d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 38:29">Genesis 38:29</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Breach</i> or <i>Breakthrough</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
