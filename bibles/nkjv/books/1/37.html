<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>This <i>is</i> the history of Jacob.</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-37-2">Joseph, <i>being</i> seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brothers. And the lad <i>was</i> with the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, his father&#8217;s wives; and Joseph brought a bad report of them to his father.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he <i>was</i> the son of his old age. Also he made him a tunic of <i>many</i> colors. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him and could not speak peaceably to him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now Joseph had a dream, and he told <i>it</i> to his brothers; and they hated him even more. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So he said to them, &#8220;Please hear this dream which I have dreamed: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>There we were, binding sheaves in the field. Then behold, my sheaf arose and also stood upright; and indeed your sheaves stood all around and bowed down to my sheaf.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And his brothers said to him, &#8220;Shall you indeed reign over us? Or shall you indeed have dominion over us?&#8221; So they hated him even more for his dreams and for his words.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then he dreamed still another dream and told it to his brothers, and said, &#8220;Look, I have dreamed another dream. And this time, the sun, the moon, and the eleven stars bowed down to me.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So he told <i>it</i> to his father and his brothers; and his father rebuked him and said to him, &#8220;What <i>is</i> this dream that you have dreamed? Shall your mother and I and your brothers indeed come to bow down to the earth before you?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And his brothers envied him, but his father kept the matter <i>in mind.</i></span></p> <h3>
Joseph Sold by His Brothers</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-37-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then his brothers went to feed their father&#8217;s flock in Shechem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And Israel said to Joseph, &#8220;Are not your brothers feeding <i>the flock</i> in Shechem? Come, I will send you to them.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-37-13">So he said to him, &#8220;Here I am.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then he said to him, &#8220;Please go and see if it is well with your brothers and well with the flocks, and bring back word to me.&#8221; So he sent him out of the Valley of Hebron, and he went to Shechem.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Now a certain man found him, and there he was, wandering in the field. And the man asked him, saying, &#8220;What are you seeking?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So he said, &#8220;I am seeking my brothers. Please tell me where they are feeding <i>their flocks.</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And the man said, &#8220;They have departed from here, for I heard them say, &#8216;Let us go to Dothan.&#8217; &#8221; So Joseph went after his brothers and found them in Dothan.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Now when they saw him afar off, even before he came near them, they conspired against him to kill him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then they said to one another, &#8220;Look, this <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>dreamer is coming! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Come therefore, let us now kill him and cast him into some pit; and we shall say, &#8216;Some wild beast has devoured him.&#8217; We shall see what will become of his dreams!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>But Reuben heard <i>it,</i> and he delivered him out of their hands, and said, &#8220;Let us not kill him.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And Reuben said to them, &#8220;Shed no blood, <i>but</i> cast him into this pit which <i>is</i> in the wilderness, and do not lay a hand on him&#8221;&#8212;that he might deliver him out of their hands, and bring him back to his father.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>So it came to pass, when Joseph had come to his brothers, that they stripped Joseph <i>of</i> his tunic, the tunic of <i>many</i> colors that <i>was</i> on him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then they took him and cast him into a pit. And the pit <i>was</i> empty; <i>there was</i> no water in it.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And they sat down to eat a meal. Then they lifted their eyes and looked, and there was a company of Ishmaelites, coming from Gilead with their camels, bearing spices, balm, and myrrh, on their way to carry <i>them</i> down to Egypt. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>So Judah said to his brothers, &#8220;What profit <i>is there</i> if we kill our brother and conceal his blood? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Come and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him, for he <i>is</i> our brother <i>and</i> our flesh.&#8221; And his brothers listened. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then Midianite traders passed by; so <i>the brothers</i> pulled Joseph up and lifted him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty <i>shekels</i> of silver. And they took Joseph to Egypt.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Then Reuben returned to the pit, and indeed Joseph <i>was</i> not in the pit; and he tore his clothes. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And he returned to his brothers and said, &#8220;The lad <i>is</i> no <i>more;</i> and I, where shall I go?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>So they took Joseph&#8217;s tunic, killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the tunic in the blood. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Then they sent the tunic of <i>many</i> colors, and they brought <i>it</i> to their father and said, &#8220;We have found this. Do you know whether it <i>is</i> your son&#8217;s tunic or not?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And he recognized it and said, &#8220;<i>It is</i> my son&#8217;s tunic. A wild beast has devoured him. Without doubt Joseph is torn to pieces.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Then Jacob tore his clothes, put sackcloth on his waist, and mourned for his son many days. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>And all his sons and all his daughters arose to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted, and he said, &#8220;For I shall go down into the grave to my son in mourning.&#8221; Thus his father wept for him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Now the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Midianites had sold him in Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh <i>and</i> captain of the guard.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-1085a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 37:1">Genesis 37:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>sojourner,</i> temporary resident</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1103b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 37:19">Genesis 37:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>master of dreams</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1120c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 37:36">Genesis 37:36</span> <span class='footnote-text'>MT <i>Medanites</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
