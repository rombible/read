<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/34-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her and lay with her, and violated her. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/34-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>His soul <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>was strongly attracted to Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the young woman and spoke <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>kindly to the young woman. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/34-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, &#8220;Get me this young woman as a wife.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/34-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter. Now his sons were with his livestock in the field; so Jacob held<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> his peace until they came. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/34-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to speak with him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/34-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard <i>it;</i> and the men were grieved and very angry, because he had done a disgraceful thing in Israel by lying with Jacob&#8217;s daughter, a thing which ought not to be done. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/34-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But Hamor spoke with them, saying, &#8220;The soul of my son Shechem longs for your daughter. Please give her to him as a wife. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/34-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And make marriages with us; give your daughters to us, and take our daughters to yourselves. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/34-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So you shall dwell with us, and the land shall be before you. Dwell and trade in it, and acquire possessions for yourselves in it.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/34-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then Shechem said to her father and her brothers, &#8220;Let me find favor in your eyes, and whatever you say to me I will give. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/34-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Ask me ever so much dowry<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span> and gift, and I will give according to what you say to me; but give me the young woman as a wife.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/34-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>But the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father, and spoke deceitfully, because he had defiled Dinah their sister. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/34-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And they said to them, &#8220;We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised, for that <i>would be</i> a reproach to us. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/34-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But on this <i>condition</i> we will consent to you: If you will become as we <i>are,</i> if every male of you is circumcised, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/34-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>then we will give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to us; and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/34-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But if you will not heed us and be circumcised, then we will take our daughter and be gone.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/34-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And their words pleased Hamor and Shechem, Hamor&#8217;s son. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/34-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>So the young man did not delay to do the thing, because he delighted in Jacob&#8217;s daughter. He <i>was</i> more honorable than all the household of his father.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/34-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And Hamor and Shechem his son came to the gate of their city, and spoke with the men of their city, saying: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/34-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>&#8220;These men <i>are</i> at peace with us. Therefore let them dwell in the land and trade in it. For indeed the land <i>is</i> large enough for them. Let us take their daughters to us as wives, and let us give them our daughters. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/34-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Only on this <i>condition</i> will the men consent to dwell with us, to be one people: if every male among us is circumcised as they <i>are</i> circumcised. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/34-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span><i>Will</i> not their livestock, their property, and every animal of theirs <i>be</i> ours? Only let us consent to them, and they will dwell with us.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/34-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And all who went out of the gate of his city heeded Hamor and Shechem his son; every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/34-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Now it came to pass on the third day, when they were in pain, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah&#8217;s brothers, each took his sword and came boldly upon the city and killed all the males. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/34-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And they killed Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah from Shechem&#8217;s house, and went out. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/34-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and plundered the city, because their sister had been defiled. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/34-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>They took their sheep, their oxen, and their donkeys, what <i>was</i> in the city and what <i>was</i> in the field, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/34-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>and all their wealth. All their little ones and their wives they took captive; and they plundered even all that <i>was</i> in the houses.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/34-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, &#8220;You have troubled me by making me obnoxious among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites; and since I <i>am</i> few in number, they will gather themselves together against me and kill me. I shall be destroyed, my household and I.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/34-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>But they said, &#8220;Should he treat our sister like a harlot?&#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-984a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 34:3">Genesis 34:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>clung to</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-984b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 34:3">Genesis 34:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>tenderly</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-986c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 34:5">Genesis 34:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>kept silent</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-993d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 34:12">Genesis 34:12</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>bride-price</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
