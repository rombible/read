<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/14-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span><i>that</i> they made war with Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar). </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/14-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>All these joined together in the Valley of Siddim (that is, the Salt Sea). </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/14-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/14-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings that <i>were</i> with him came and attacked the Rephaim in Ashteroth Karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, the Emim in Shaveh Kiriathaim, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/14-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and the Horites in their mountain of Seir, as far as El Paran, which <i>is</i> by the wilderness. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/14-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then they turned back and came to En Mishpat (that <i>is,</i> Kadesh), and attacked all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites who dwelt in Hazezon Tamar.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/14-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that <i>is,</i> Zoar) went out and joined together in battle in the Valley of Siddim </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/14-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>nations, Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar&#8212;four kings against five. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/14-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Now the Valley of Siddim <i>was full of</i> asphalt pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled; <i>some</i> fell there, and the remainder fled to the mountains. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/14-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their provisions, and went their way. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/14-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>They also took Lot, Abram&#8217;s brother&#8217;s son who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/14-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then one who had escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew, for he dwelt by <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>the terebinth trees of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and brother of Aner; and they <i>were</i> allies with Abram. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/14-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Now when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his three hundred and eighteen trained <i>servants</i> who were born in his own house, and went in pursuit as far as Dan. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/14-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>He divided his forces against them by night, and he and his servants attacked them and pursued them as far as Hobah, which <i>is</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>north of Damascus. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/14-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So he brought back all the goods, and also brought back his brother Lot and his goods, as well as the women and the people.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/14-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And the king of Sodom went out to meet him at the Valley of Shaveh (that <i>is,</i> the King&#8217;s Valley), after his return from the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>defeat of Chedorlaomer and the kings who <i>were</i> with him.</span></p> <h3>
