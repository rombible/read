<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/22-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then He said, &#8220;Take now your son, your only <i>son</i> Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/22-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son; and he split the wood for the burnt offering, and arose and went to the place of which God had told him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/22-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then on the third day Abraham lifted his eyes and saw the place afar off. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/22-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And Abraham said to his young men, &#8220;Stay here with the donkey; the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>lad and I will go yonder and worship, and we will come back to you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/22-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid <i>it</i> on Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife, and the two of them went together. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/22-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and said, &#8220;My father!&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-22-7">And he said, &#8220;Here I am, my son.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-22-7">Then he said, &#8220;Look, the fire and the wood, but where <i>is</i> the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>lamb for a burnt offering?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/22-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And Abraham said, &#8220;My son, God will provide for Himself the lamb for a burnt offering.&#8221; So the two of them went together.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/22-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then they came to the place of which God had told him. And Abraham built an altar there and placed the wood in order; and he bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar, upon the wood. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/22-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And Abraham stretched out his hand and took the knife to slay his son.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/22-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But the Angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> called to him from heaven and said, &#8220;Abraham, Abraham!&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-22-11">So he said, &#8220;Here I am.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/22-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And He said, &#8220;Do not lay your hand on the lad, or do anything to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only <i>son,</i> from Me.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/22-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then Abraham lifted his eyes and looked, and there behind <i>him was</i> a ram caught in a thicket by its horns. So Abraham went and took the ram, and offered it up for a burnt offering instead of his son. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/22-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And Abraham called the name of the place, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>The-<span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>-Will-Provide; as it is said <i>to</i> this day, &#8220;In the Mount of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> it shall be provided.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/22-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then the Angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> called to Abraham a second time out of heaven, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/22-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>and said: &#8220;By Myself I have sworn, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, because you have done this thing, and have not withheld your son, your only <i>son</i>&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/22-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply your descendants as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which <i>is</i> on the seashore; and your descendants shall possess the gate of their enemies. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/22-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>In your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, because you have obeyed My voice.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/22-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>So Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.</span></p> <h3>
