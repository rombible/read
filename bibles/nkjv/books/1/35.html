<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Jacob said to his household and to all who <i>were</i> with him, &#8220;Put away the foreign gods that <i>are</i> among you, purify yourselves, and change your garments. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then let us arise and go up to Bethel; and I will make an altar there to God, who answered me in the day of my distress and has been with me in the way which I have gone.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So they gave Jacob all the foreign <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>gods which <i>were</i> in their hands, and the earrings which <i>were</i> in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the terebinth tree which <i>was</i> by Shechem.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And they journeyed, and the terror of God was upon the cities that <i>were</i> all around them, and they did not pursue the sons of Jacob. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So Jacob came to Luz (that <i>is,</i> Bethel), which <i>is</i> in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who <i>were</i> with him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And he built an altar there and called the place <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>El Bethel, because there God appeared to him when he fled from the face of his brother.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Now Deborah, Rebekah&#8217;s nurse, died, and she was buried below Bethel under the terebinth tree. So the name of it was called <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Allon Bachuth.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then God appeared to Jacob again, when he came from Padan Aram, and blessed him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And God said to him, &#8220;Your name <i>is</i> Jacob; your name shall not be called Jacob anymore, but Israel shall be your name.&#8221; So He called his name Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Also God said to him: &#8220;I <i>am</i> God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall proceed from you, and kings shall come from your body. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>The land which I gave Abraham and Isaac I give to you; and to your descendants after you I give this land.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then God went<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span> up from him in the place where He talked with him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So Jacob set up a pillar in the place where He talked with him, a pillar of stone; and he poured a drink offering on it, and he poured oil on it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him, Bethel.</span></p> <h3>
Death of Rachel</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-35-16"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then they journeyed from Bethel. And when there was but a little distance to go to Ephrath, Rachel labored <i>in childbirth,</i> and she had hard labor. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Now it came to pass, when she was in hard labor, that the midwife said to her, &#8220;Do not fear; you will have this son also.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And so it was, as her soul was departing (for she died), that she called his name <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>Ben-Oni; but his father called him <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>Benjamin. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that <i>is,</i> Bethlehem). </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And Jacob set a pillar on her grave, which <i>is</i> the pillar of Rachel&#8217;s grave to this day.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then Israel journeyed and pitched his tent beyond the tower of Eder. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And it happened, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father&#8217;s concubine; and Israel heard <i>about it.</i></span></p><h3><span class="text Gen-35-22">Jacob&#8217;s Twelve Sons</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-35-22">Now the sons of Jacob were twelve: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>the sons of Leah <i>were</i> Reuben, Jacob&#8217;s firstborn, and Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>the sons of Rachel <i>were</i> Joseph and Benjamin; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>the sons of Bilhah, Rachel&#8217;s maidservant, <i>were</i> Dan and Naphtali; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>and the sons of Zilpah, Leah&#8217;s maidservant, <i>were</i> Gad and Asher. These <i>were</i> the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Padan Aram.</span></p> <h3>
Death of Isaac</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-35-27"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Then Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre, or Kirjath Arba<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span> (that <i>is,</i> Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had dwelt. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Now the days of Isaac were one hundred and eighty years. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>So Isaac breathed his last and died, and was <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>gathered to his people, <i>being</i> old and full of days. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-1016a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 35:4">Genesis 35:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>idols</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1019b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 35:7">Genesis 35:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>God of the House of God</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1020c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 35:8">Genesis 35:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Terebinth of Weeping</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1025d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 35:13">Genesis 35:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>departed</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1030e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 35:18">Genesis 35:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Son of My Sorrow</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1030f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 35:18">Genesis 35:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Son of the Right Hand</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1039g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 35:27">Genesis 35:27</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Town</i> or <i>City of Arba</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1041h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 35:29">Genesis 35:29</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Joined his ancestors</span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
