<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Suddenly there came up out of the river seven cows, fine looking and fat; and they fed in the meadow. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then behold, seven other cows came up after them out of the river, ugly and gaunt, and stood by the <i>other</i> cows on the bank of the river. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And the ugly and gaunt cows ate up the seven fine looking and fat cows. So Pharaoh awoke. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>He slept and dreamed a second time; and suddenly seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, plump and good. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then behold, seven thin heads, blighted by the east wind, sprang up after them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And the seven thin heads devoured the seven plump and full heads. So Pharaoh awoke, and indeed, <i>it was</i> a dream. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Now it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt and all its wise men. And Pharaoh told them his dreams, but <i>there was</i> no one who could interpret them for Pharaoh.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then the chief butler spoke to Pharaoh, saying: &#8220;I remember my faults this day. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>When Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and put me in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, <i>both</i> me and the chief baker, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>we each had a dream in one night, he and I. Each of us dreamed according to the interpretation of his <i>own</i> dream. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now there <i>was</i> a young Hebrew man with us there, a servant of the captain of the guard. And we told him, and he interpreted our dreams for us; to each man he interpreted according to his <i>own</i> dream. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And it came to pass, just as he interpreted for us, so it happened. He restored me to my office, and he hanged him.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him quickly out of the dungeon; and he shaved, changed his clothing, and came to Pharaoh. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And Pharaoh said to Joseph, &#8220;I have had a dream, and <i>there is</i> no one who can interpret it. But I have heard it said of you <i>that</i> you can understand a dream, to interpret it.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, &#8220;<i>It is</i> not in me; God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then Pharaoh said to Joseph: &#8220;Behold, in my dream I stood on the bank of the river. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Suddenly seven cows came up out of the river, fine looking and fat; and they fed in the meadow. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then behold, seven other cows came up after them, poor and very ugly and gaunt, such ugliness as I have never seen in all the land of Egypt. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And the gaunt and ugly cows ate up the first seven, the fat cows. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>When they had eaten them up, no one would have known that they had eaten them, for they <i>were</i> just as ugly as at the beginning. So I awoke. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Also I saw in my dream, and suddenly seven <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>heads came up on one stalk, full and good. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Then behold, seven heads, withered, thin, <i>and</i> blighted by the east wind, sprang up after them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And the thin heads devoured the seven good heads. So I told <i>this</i> to the magicians, but <i>there was</i> no one who could explain <i>it</i> to me.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, &#8220;The dreams of Pharaoh <i>are</i> one; God has shown Pharaoh what He <i>is</i> about to do: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>The seven good cows <i>are</i> seven years, and the seven good <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>heads <i>are</i> seven years; the dreams <i>are</i> one. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And the seven thin and ugly cows which came up after them <i>are</i> seven years, and the seven empty heads blighted by the east wind are seven years of famine. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>This <i>is</i> the thing which I have spoken to Pharaoh. God has shown Pharaoh what He <i>is</i> about to do. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Indeed seven years of great plenty will come throughout all the land of Egypt; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>but after them seven years of famine will arise, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine will deplete the land. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>So the plenty will not be known in the land because of the famine following, for it <i>will be</i> very severe. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And the dream was repeated to Pharaoh twice because the thing <i>is</i> established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>&#8220;Now therefore, let Pharaoh select a discerning and wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Let Pharaoh do <i>this,</i> and let him appoint <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>officers over the land, to collect one-fifth <i>of the produce</i> of the land of Egypt in the seven plentiful years. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>And let them gather all the food of those good years that are coming, and store up grain under the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>authority of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Then that food shall be as a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>reserve for the land for the seven years of famine which shall be in the land of Egypt, that the land may not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>perish during the famine.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Joseph&#8217;s Rise to Power</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-41-37"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>So the advice was good in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servants. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>And Pharaoh said to his servants, &#8220;Can we find <i>such a one</i> as this, a man in whom <i>is</i> the Spirit of God?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, &#8220;Inasmuch as God has shown you all this, <i>there is</i> no one as discerning and wise as you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>You shall be <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>over my house, and all my people shall be ruled according to your word; only in regard to the throne will I be greater than you.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>And Pharaoh said to Joseph, &#8220;See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>Then Pharaoh took his signet ring off his hand and put it on Joseph&#8217;s hand; and he clothed him in garments of fine linen and put a gold chain around his neck. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>And he had him ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried out before him, &#8220;Bow the knee!&#8221; So he set him over all the land of Egypt. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>Pharaoh also said to Joseph, &#8220;I <i>am</i> Pharaoh, and without your consent no man may lift his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>And Pharaoh called Joseph&#8217;s name <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>Zaphnath-Paaneah. And he gave him as a wife Asenath, the daughter of Poti-Pherah priest of On. So Joseph went out over <i>all</i> the land of Egypt.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span>Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-47.htm"><b>47</b></a></span>Now in the seven plentiful years the ground brought forth <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>abundantly. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-48.htm"><b>48</b></a></span>So he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities; he laid up in every city the food of the fields which surrounded them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-49.htm"><b>49</b></a></span>Joseph gathered very much grain, as the sand of the sea, until he stopped counting, for <i>it was</i> immeasurable.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-50.htm"><b>50</b></a></span>And to Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Poti-Pherah priest of On, bore to him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-51.htm"><b>51</b></a></span>Joseph called the name of the firstborn <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>Manasseh: &#8220;For God has made me forget all my toil and all my father&#8217;s house.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-52.htm"><b>52</b></a></span>And the name of the second he called <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span>Ephraim: &#8220;For God has caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-53.htm"><b>53</b></a></span>Then the seven years of plenty which were in the land of Egypt ended, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-54.htm"><b>54</b></a></span>and the seven years of famine began to come, as Joseph had said. The famine was in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-55.htm"><b>55</b></a></span>So when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread. Then Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, &#8220;Go to Joseph; whatever he says to you, do.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-56.htm"><b>56</b></a></span>The famine was over all the face of the earth, and Joseph opened <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[l]</a></span>all the storehouses and sold to the Egyptians. And the famine became severe in the land of Egypt. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-57.htm"><b>57</b></a></span>So all countries came to Joseph in Egypt to buy <i>grain,</i> because the famine was severe in all lands.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-1218a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 41:22">Genesis 41:22</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heads of grain</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1222b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 41:26">Genesis 41:26</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heads of grain</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1230c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 41:34">Genesis 41:34</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>overseers</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1231d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 41:35">Genesis 41:35</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>hand</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1232e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 41:36">Genesis 41:36</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>supply</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1232f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 41:36">Genesis 41:36</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>be cut off</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1236g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 41:40">Genesis 41:40</span> <span class='footnote-text'>In charge of</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1241h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 41:45">Genesis 41:45</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Probably Egyptian for <i>God Speaks and He Lives</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1243i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 41:47">Genesis 41:47</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>by handfuls</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1247j"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 41:51">Genesis 41:51</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Making Forgetful</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1248k"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 41:52">Genesis 41:52</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Fruitfulness</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1252l"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 41:56">Genesis 41:56</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>all that was in them</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
