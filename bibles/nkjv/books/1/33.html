So he divided the children among Leah, Rachel, and the two maidservants. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/33-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he put the maidservants and their children in front, Leah and her children behind, and Rachel and Joseph last. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/33-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then he crossed over before them and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/33-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/33-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And he lifted his eyes and saw the women and children, and said, &#8220;Who <i>are</i> these with you?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-33-5">So he said, &#8220;The children whom God has graciously given your servant.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/33-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then the maidservants came near, they and their children, and bowed down. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/33-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And Leah also came near with her children, and they bowed down. Afterward Joseph and Rachel came near, and they bowed down.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/33-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then Esau said, &#8220;What <i>do</i> you <i>mean by</i> all this company which I met?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-33-8">And he said, &#8220;<i>These are</i> to find favor in the sight of my lord.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/33-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But Esau said, &#8220;I have enough, my brother; keep what you have for yourself.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/33-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And Jacob said, &#8220;No, please, if I have now found favor in your sight, then receive my present from my hand, inasmuch as I have seen your face as though I had seen the face of God, and you were pleased with me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/33-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Please, take my blessing that is brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>enough.&#8221; So he urged him, and he took <i>it.</i></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/33-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then Esau said, &#8220;Let us take our journey; let us go, and I will go before you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/33-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>But Jacob said to him, &#8220;My lord knows that the children <i>are</i> weak, and the flocks and herds which are nursing <i>are</i> with me. And if the men should drive them hard one day, all the flock will die. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/33-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Please let my lord go on ahead before his servant. I will lead on slowly at a pace which the livestock that go before me, and the children, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>are able to endure, until I come to my lord in Seir.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/33-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And Esau said, &#8220;Now let me leave with you <i>some</i> of the people who <i>are</i> with me.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-33-15">But he said, &#8220;What need is there? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/33-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/33-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, built himself a house, and made <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>booths for his livestock. Therefore the name of the place is called <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>Succoth.</span></p> <h3>
Jacob Comes to Canaan</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-33-18"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/33-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then Jacob came <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>safely to the city of Shechem, which <i>is</i> in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padan Aram; and he pitched his tent before the city. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/33-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And he bought the parcel of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>land, where he had pitched his tent, from the children of Hamor, Shechem&#8217;s father, for one hundred pieces of money. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/33-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then he erected an altar there and called it El<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span> Elohe Israel.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-972a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 33:11">Genesis 33:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>all</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-975b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 33:14">Genesis 33:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>can stand</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-978c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 33:17">Genesis 33:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>shelters</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-978d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 33:17">Genesis 33:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Booths</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-979e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 33:18">Genesis 33:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>to Shalem, a city of</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-980f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 33:19">Genesis 33:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>the field</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-981g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 33:20">Genesis 33:20</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>God, the God of Israel</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
