<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And she bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Jokshan begot Sheba and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And the sons of Midian <i>were</i> Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abidah, and Eldaah. All these <i>were</i> the children of Keturah.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But Abraham gave gifts to the sons of the concubines which Abraham had; and while he was still living he sent them eastward, away from Isaac his son, to the country of the east.</span></p> <h3>
Abraham&#8217;s Death and Burial</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-25-7"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>This <i>is</i> the sum of the years of Abraham&#8217;s life which he lived: one hundred and seventy-five years. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then Abraham breathed his last and died in a good old age, an old man and full <i>of years,</i> and was gathered to his people. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, which <i>is</i> before Mamre, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>the field which Abraham purchased from the sons of Heth. There Abraham was buried, and Sarah his wife. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And it came to pass, after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac. And Isaac dwelt at Beer Lahai Roi.</span></p> <h3>
The Families of Ishmael and Isaac</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-25-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now this <i>is</i> the genealogy of Ishmael, Abraham&#8217;s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah&#8217;s maidservant, bore to Abraham. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And these <i>were</i> the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: The firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Mishma, Dumah, Massa, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>Hadar, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>These <i>were</i> the sons of Ishmael and these <i>were</i> their names, by their towns and their <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>settlements, twelve princes according to their nations. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>These <i>were</i> the years of the life of Ishmael: one hundred and thirty-seven years; and he breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>(They dwelt from Havilah as far as Shur, which <i>is</i> east of Egypt as you go toward Assyria.) He <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>died in the presence of all his brethren.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>This <i>is</i> the genealogy of Isaac, Abraham&#8217;s son. Abraham begot Isaac. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah as wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan Aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Now Isaac pleaded with the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> for his wife, because she <i>was</i> barren; and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> granted his plea, and Rebekah his wife conceived. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But the children struggled together within her; and she said, &#8220;If <i>all is</i> well, why <i>am I like</i> this?&#8221; So she went to inquire of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to her:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Gen-25-23">&#8220;Two nations <i>are</i> in your womb,</span><br /><span class="text Gen-25-23">Two peoples shall be separated from your body;</span><br /><span class="text Gen-25-23"><i>One</i> people shall be stronger than the other,</span><br /><span class="text Gen-25-23">And the older shall serve the younger.&#8221;</span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>So when her days were fulfilled <i>for her</i> to give birth, indeed <i>there were</i> twins in her womb. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And the first came out red. <i>He was</i> like a hairy garment all over; so they called his name <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>Esau. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Afterward his brother came out, and his hand took hold of Esau&#8217;s heel; so his name was called <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>Jacob. Isaac <i>was</i> sixty years old when she bore them.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>So the boys grew. And Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field; but Jacob was a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>mild man, dwelling in tents. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And Isaac loved Esau because he ate <i>of his</i> game, but Rebekah loved Jacob.</span></p> <h3>
Esau Sells His Birthright</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-25-29"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Now Jacob cooked a stew; and Esau came in from the field, and he <i>was</i> weary. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And Esau said to Jacob, &#8220;Please feed me with that same red <i>stew,</i> for I <i>am</i> weary.&#8221; Therefore his name was called <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>Edom.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>But Jacob said, &#8220;Sell me your birthright as of this day.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And Esau said, &#8220;Look, I <i>am</i> about to die; so what <i>is</i> this birthright to me?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Then Jacob said, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>&#8220;Swear to me as of this day.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-25-33">So he swore to him, and sold his birthright to Jacob. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>And Jacob gave Esau bread and stew of lentils; then he ate and drank, arose, and went his way.
