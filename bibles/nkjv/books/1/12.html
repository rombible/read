<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/12-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So Abram departed as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had spoken to him, and Lot went with him. And Abram <i>was</i> seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/12-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then Abram took Sarai his wife and Lot his brother&#8217;s son, and all their possessions that they had gathered, and the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>people whom they had acquired in Haran, and they departed to go to the land of Canaan. So they came to the land of Canaan. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/12-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Abram passed through the land to the place of Shechem, as far as <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>the terebinth tree of Moreh. And the Canaanites <i>were</i> then in the land.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/12-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> appeared to Abram and said, &#8220;To your <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>descendants I will give this land.&#8221; And there he built an altar to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, who had appeared to him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/12-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And he moved from there to the mountain east of Bethel, and he pitched his tent <i>with</i> Bethel on the west and Ai on the east; there he built an altar to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and called on the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/12-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So Abram journeyed, going on still toward the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>South.</span></p> <h3>
Abram in Egypt</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-12-10"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/12-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Now there was a famine in the land, and Abram went down to Egypt to dwell there, for the famine <i>was</i> severe in the land. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/12-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And it came to pass, when he was close to entering Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, &#8220;Indeed I know that you <i>are</i> a woman of beautiful countenance. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/12-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Therefore it will happen, when the Egyptians see you, that they will say, &#8216;This <i>is</i> his wife&#8217;; and they will kill me, but they will let you live. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/12-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Please say you <i>are</i> my sister, that it may be well with me for your sake, and that <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>I may live because of you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/12-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So it was, when Abram came into Egypt, that the Egyptians saw the woman, that she <i>was</i> very beautiful. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/12-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>The princes of Pharaoh also saw her and commended her to Pharaoh. And the woman was taken to Pharaoh&#8217;s house. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/12-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>He treated Abram well for her sake. He had sheep, oxen, male donkeys, male and female servants, female donkeys, and camels.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/12-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram&#8217;s wife. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/12-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And Pharaoh called Abram and said, &#8220;What <i>is</i> this you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she <i>was</i> your wife? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/12-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Why did you say, &#8216;She <i>is</i> my sister&#8217;? I might have taken her as my wife. Now therefore, here is your wife; take <i>her</i> and go your way.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/12-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So Pharaoh commanded <i>his</i> men concerning him; and they sent him away, with his wife and all that he had.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-304a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 12:5">Genesis 12:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>souls</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-305b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 12:6">Genesis 12:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. <i>Alon Moreh</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-306c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 12:7">Genesis 12:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>seed</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-308d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 12:9">Genesis 12:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. <i>Negev</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-312e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 12:13">Genesis 12:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>my soul</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
