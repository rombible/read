<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/7-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>You shall take with you seven each of every clean animal, a male and his female; two each of animals that <i>are</i> unclean, a male and his female; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/7-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>also seven each of birds of the air, male and female, to keep <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>the species alive on the face of all the earth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For after seven more days I will cause it to rain on the earth forty days and forty nights, and I will <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>destroy from the face of the earth all living things that I have made.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/7-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And Noah did according to all that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> commanded him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/7-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Noah <i>was</i> six hundred years old when the floodwaters were on the earth.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/7-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So Noah, with his sons, his wife, and his sons&#8217; wives, went into the ark because of the waters of the flood. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/7-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Of clean animals, of animals that <i>are</i> unclean, of birds, and of everything that creeps on the earth, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>two by two they went into the ark to Noah, male and female, as God had commanded Noah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And it came to pass after seven days that the waters of the flood were on the earth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/7-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>In the six hundredth year of Noah&#8217;s life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/7-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And the rain was on the earth forty days and forty nights.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/7-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>On the very same day Noah and Noah&#8217;s sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, and Noah&#8217;s wife and the three wives of his sons with them, entered the ark&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/7-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>they and every beast after its kind, all cattle after their kind, every creeping thing that creeps on the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind, every bird of every sort. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/7-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And they went into the ark to Noah, two by two, of all flesh in which <i>is</i> the breath of life. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/7-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So those that entered, male and female of all flesh, went in as God had commanded him; and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> shut him in.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/7-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Now the flood was on the earth forty days. The waters increased and lifted up the ark, and it rose high above the earth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/7-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>The waters prevailed and greatly increased on the earth, and the ark moved about on the surface of the waters. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/7-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And the waters prevailed exceedingly on the earth, and all the high hills under the whole heaven were covered. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/7-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>The waters prevailed fifteen cubits upward, and the mountains were covered. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/7-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And all flesh died that moved on <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>the earth: birds and cattle and beasts and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, and every man. </span>
