And he said to the woman, &#8220;Has God indeed said, &#8216;You shall not eat of every tree of the garden&#8217;?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And the woman said to the serpent, &#8220;We may eat the fruit of the trees of the garden; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>but of the fruit of the tree which <i>is</i> in the midst of the garden, God has said, &#8216;You shall not eat it, nor shall you touch it, lest you die.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then the serpent said to the woman, &#8220;You will not surely die. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So when the woman saw that the tree <i>was</i> good for food, that it <i>was</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>pleasant to the eyes, and a tree desirable to make <i>one</i> wise, she took of its fruit and ate.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they <i>were</i> naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>coverings.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And they heard the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>sound of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God walking in the garden in the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>cool of the day, and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God among the trees of the garden.</span></p> <p>
