And God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters subsided. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>The fountains of the deep and the windows of heaven were also stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And the waters receded continually from the earth. At the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters decreased. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then the ark rested in the seventh month, the seventeenth day of the month, on the mountains of Ararat. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month. In the tenth <i>month,</i> on the first <i>day</i> of the month, the tops of the mountains were seen.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So it came to pass, at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then he sent out a raven, which kept going to and fro until the waters had dried up from the earth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>He also sent out from himself a dove, to see if the waters had receded from the face of the ground. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But the dove found no resting place for the sole of her foot, and she returned into the ark to him, for the waters <i>were</i> on the face of the whole earth. So he put out his hand and took her, and drew her into the ark to himself. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And he waited yet another seven days, and again he sent the dove out from the ark. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then the dove came to him in the evening, and behold, a freshly plucked olive leaf <i>was</i> in her mouth; and Noah knew that the waters had receded from the earth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/8-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So he waited yet another seven days and sent out the dove, which did not return again to him anymore.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/8-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year, in the first <i>month,</i> the first <i>day</i> of the month, that the waters were dried up from the earth; and Noah removed the covering of the ark and looked, and indeed the surface of the ground was dry. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/8-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And in the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dried.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/8-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then God spoke to Noah, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/8-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>&#8220;Go out of the ark, you and your wife, and your sons and your sons&#8217; wives with you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/8-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Bring out with you every living thing of all flesh that <i>is</i> with you: birds and cattle and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, so that they may abound on the earth, and be fruitful and multiply on the earth.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/8-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>So Noah went out, and his sons and his wife and his sons&#8217; wives with him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/8-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Every animal, every creeping thing, every bird, <i>and</i> whatever creeps on the earth, according to their families, went out of the ark.</span></p> <h3>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/8-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> smelled a soothing aroma.
