When Lot saw <i>them,</i> he rose to meet them, and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;Here now, my lords, please turn in to your servant&#8217;s house and spend the night, and wash your feet; then you may rise early and go on your way.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-19-2">And they said, &#8220;No, but we will spend the night in the open square.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But he insisted strongly; so they turned in to him and entered his house. Then he made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Now before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, both old and young, all the people from every quarter, surrounded the house. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And they called to Lot and said to him, &#8220;Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us that we may know them <i>carnally.</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So Lot went out to them through the doorway, shut the door behind him, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and said, &#8220;Please, my brethren, do not do so wickedly! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>See now, I have two daughters who have not known a man; please, let me bring them out to you, and you may do to them as you wish; only do nothing to these men, since this is the reason they have come under the shadow of my roof.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And they said, &#8220;Stand back!&#8221; Then they said, &#8220;This one came in to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>stay <i>here,</i> and he keeps acting as a judge; now we will deal worse with you than with them.&#8221; So they pressed hard against the man Lot, and came near to break down the door. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>But the men reached out their hands and pulled Lot into the house with them, and shut the door. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And they struck the men who <i>were</i> at the doorway of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they became weary <i>trying</i> to find the door.</span></p> <h3>
Sodom and Gomorrah Destroyed</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-19-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then the men said to Lot, &#8220;Have you anyone else here? Son-in-law, your sons, your daughters, and whomever you have in the city&#8212;take <i>them</i> out of this place! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For we will destroy this place, because the outcry against them has grown great before the face of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has sent us to destroy it.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who had married his daughters, and said, &#8220;Get up, get out of this place; for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will destroy this city!&#8221; But to his sons-in-law he seemed to be joking.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>When the morning dawned, the angels urged Lot to hurry, saying, &#8220;Arise, take your wife and your two daughters who are here, lest you be consumed in the punishment of the city.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And while he lingered, the men took hold of his hand, his wife&#8217;s hand, and the hands of his two daughters, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> being merciful to him, and they brought him out and set him outside the city. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So it came to pass, when they had brought them outside, that <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>he said, &#8220;Escape for your life! Do not look behind you nor stay anywhere in the plain. Escape to the mountains, lest you be <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>destroyed.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then Lot said to them, &#8220;Please, no, my lords! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Indeed now, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have increased your mercy which you have shown me by saving my life; but I cannot escape to the mountains, lest some evil overtake me and I die. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>See now, this city <i>is</i> near <i>enough</i> to flee to, and it <i>is</i> a little one; please let me escape there (<i>is</i> it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And he said to him, &#8220;See, I have favored you concerning this thing also, in that I will not overthrow this city for which you have spoken. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Hurry, escape there. For I cannot do anything until you arrive there.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-19-22">Therefore the name of the city was called <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>Zoar.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>The sun had risen upon the earth when Lot entered Zoar. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> rained brimstone and fire on Sodom and Gomorrah, from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> out of the heavens. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>So He <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>overthrew those cities, all the plain, all the inhabitants of the cities, and what grew on the ground.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>But his wife looked back behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And Abraham went early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain; and he saw, and behold, the smoke of the land which went up like the smoke of a furnace. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when He overthrew the cities in which Lot had dwelt.</span></p> <h3>
The Descendants of Lot</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-19-30"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Then Lot went up out of Zoar and dwelt in the mountains, and his two daughters were with him; for he was afraid to dwell in Zoar. And he and his two daughters dwelt in a cave. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Now the firstborn said to the younger, &#8220;Our father <i>is</i> old, and <i>there is</i> no man on the earth to come in to us as is the custom of all the earth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>lineage of our father.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>So they made their father drink wine that night. And the firstborn went in and lay with her father, and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>It happened on the next day that the firstborn said to the younger, &#8220;Indeed I lay with my father last night; let us make him drink wine tonight also, and you go in <i>and</i> lie with him, that we may preserve the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>lineage of our father.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Then they made their father drink wine that night also. And the younger arose and lay with him, and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Thus both the daughters of Lot were with child by their father. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>The firstborn bore a son and called his name Moab; he <i>is</i> the father of the Moabites to this day. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>And the younger, she also bore a son and called his name Ben-Ammi; he <i>is</i> the father of the people of Ammon to this day.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-467a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 19:9">Genesis 19:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'>As a resident alien</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-475b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 19:17">Genesis 19:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'>LXX, Syr., Vg. <i>they</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-475c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 19:17">Genesis 19:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>swept away</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-480d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 19:22">Genesis 19:22</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Little</i> or <i>Insignificant</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-483e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 19:25">Genesis 19:25</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>devastated</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-490f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 19:32">Genesis 19:32</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>seed</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-492g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 19:34">Genesis 19:34</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>seed</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
