<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then they said to one another, &#8220;Come, let us make bricks and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>bake <i>them</i> thoroughly.&#8221; They had brick for stone, and they had asphalt for mortar. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And they said, &#8220;Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower whose top <i>is</i> in the heavens; let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered abroad over the face of the whole earth.&#8221;</span></p> <p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Come, let Us go down and there confuse their language, that they may not understand one another&#8217;s speech.&#8221; </span>
