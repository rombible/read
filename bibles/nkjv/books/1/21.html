<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/21-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>For Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/21-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him&#8212;whom Sarah bore to him&#8212;Isaac.<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/21-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/21-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now Abraham was one hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/21-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And Sarah said, &#8220;God has <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>made me laugh, <i>and</i> all who hear will laugh with me.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/21-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>She also said, &#8220;Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? For I have borne <i>him</i> a son in his old age.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Hagar and Ishmael Depart</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-21-8"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/21-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So the child grew and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the same day that Isaac was weaned.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/21-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, scoffing.<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/21-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Therefore she said to Abraham, &#8220;Cast out this bondwoman and her son; for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, <i>namely</i> with Isaac.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/21-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And the matter was very <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>displeasing in Abraham&#8217;s sight because of his son.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/21-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But God said to Abraham, &#8220;Do not let it be displeasing in your sight because of the lad or because of your bondwoman. Whatever Sarah has said to you, listen to her voice; for in Isaac your seed shall be called. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/21-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Yet I will also make a nation of the son of the bondwoman, because he <i>is</i> your <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>seed.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/21-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So Abraham rose early in the morning, and took bread and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>a skin of water; and putting <i>it</i> on her shoulder, he gave <i>it</i> and the boy to Hagar, and sent her away. Then she departed and wandered in the Wilderness of Beersheba. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/21-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And the water in the skin was used up, and she placed the boy under one of the shrubs. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/21-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then she went and sat down across from <i>him</i> at a distance of about a bowshot; for she said to herself, &#8220;Let me not see the death of the boy.&#8221; So she sat opposite <i>him,</i> and lifted her voice and wept.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/21-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And God heard the voice of the lad. Then the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said to her, &#8220;What ails you, Hagar? Fear not, for God has heard the voice of the lad where he <i>is.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/21-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Arise, lift up the lad and hold him with your hand, for I will make him a great nation.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/21-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. And she went and filled the skin with water, and gave the lad a drink. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/21-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So God was with the lad; and he grew and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/21-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>He dwelt in the Wilderness of Paran; and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt.</span></p> <h3>
A Covenant with Abimelech</span></h3><p><span class="text Gen-21-22"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/21-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And it came to pass at that time that Abimelech and Phichol, the commander of his army, spoke to Abraham, saying, &#8220;God <i>is</i> with you in all that you do. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/21-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Now therefore, swear<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span> to me by God that you will not deal falsely with me, with my offspring, or with my posterity; but that according to the kindness that I have done to you, you will do to me and to the land in which you have dwelt.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/21-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And Abraham said, &#8220;I will swear.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/21-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then Abraham rebuked Abimelech because of a well of water which Abimelech&#8217;s servants had seized. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/21-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And Abimelech said, &#8220;I do not know who has done this thing; you did not tell me, nor had I heard <i>of it</i> until today.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/21-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>So Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two of them made a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>covenant. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/21-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/21-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Then Abimelech asked Abraham, &#8220;What <i>is the meaning of</i> these seven ewe lambs which you have set by themselves?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/21-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;You will take <i>these</i> seven ewe lambs from my hand, that they may be my witness that I have dug this well.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/21-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Therefore he called that place <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>Beersheba, because the two of them swore an oath there.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/21-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba. So Abimelech rose with Phichol, the commander of his army, and they returned to the land of the Philistines. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/21-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Then <i>Abraham</i> planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there called on the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, the Everlasting God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/21-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>And Abraham stayed in the land of the Philistines many days.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-517a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 21:3">Genesis 21:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Laughter</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-520b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 21:6">Genesis 21:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>made laughter for me</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-523c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 21:9">Genesis 21:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>laughing</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-525d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 21:11">Genesis 21:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>distressing</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-527e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 21:13">Genesis 21:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>descendant</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-528f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 21:14">Genesis 21:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'>A water bottle made of skins</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-537g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 21:23">Genesis 21:23</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>take an oath</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-541h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 21:27">Genesis 21:27</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>treaty</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-545i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 21:31">Genesis 21:31</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Well of the Oath</i> or <i>Well of the Seven</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
