And Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him down there. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was with Joseph, and he was a successful man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And his master saw that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>was</i> with him and that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> made all he did <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>to prosper in his hand. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So Joseph found favor in his sight, and served him. Then he made him overseer of his house, and all <i>that</i> he had he put <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>under his authority. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So it was, from the time <i>that</i> he had made him overseer of his house and all that he had, that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> blessed the Egyptian&#8217;s house for Joseph&#8217;s sake; and the blessing of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was on all that he had in the house and in the field. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Thus he left all that he had in Joseph&#8217;s <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>hand, and he did not know what he had except for the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>bread which he ate.</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-39-6">Now Joseph was handsome in form and appearance.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And it came to pass after these things that his master&#8217;s wife <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>cast longing eyes on Joseph, and she said, &#8220;Lie with me.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But he refused and said to his master&#8217;s wife, &#8220;Look, my master does not know what <i>is</i> with me in the house, and he has committed all that he has to my hand. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span><i>There is</i> no one greater in this house than I, nor has he kept back anything from me but you, because you <i>are</i> his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So it was, as she spoke to Joseph day by day, that he did not heed her, to lie with her <i>or</i> to be with her.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But it happened about this time, when Joseph went into the house to do his work, and none of the men of the house <i>was</i> inside, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>that she caught him by his garment, saying, &#8220;Lie with me.&#8221; But he left his garment in her hand, and fled and ran outside. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And so it was, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and fled outside, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>that she called to the men of her house and spoke to them, saying, &#8220;See, he has brought in to us a Hebrew to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>mock us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried out with a loud voice. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And it happened, when he heard that I lifted my voice and cried out, that he left his garment with me, and fled and went outside.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So she kept his garment with her until his master came home. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then she spoke to him with words like these, saying, &#8220;The Hebrew servant whom you brought to us came in to me to mock me; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>so it happened, as I lifted my voice and cried out, that he left his garment with me and fled outside.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>So it was, when his master heard the words which his wife spoke to him, saying, &#8220;Your servant did to me after this manner,&#8221; that his anger was aroused. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then Joseph&#8217;s master took him and put him into the prison, a place where the king&#8217;s prisoners <i>were</i> confined. And he was there in the prison. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>But the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was with Joseph and showed him mercy, and He gave<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span> him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph&#8217;s hand all the prisoners who <i>were</i> in the prison; whatever they did there, it was his doing. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>The keeper of the prison did not look into anything <i>that was</i> under <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span><i>Joseph&#8217;s</i> authority, because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was with him; and whatever he did, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> made <i>it</i> prosper.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-1153a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 39:3">Genesis 39:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>to be a success</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1154b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 39:4">Genesis 39:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>in his hand</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1156c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 39:6">Genesis 39:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Care</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1156d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 39:6">Genesis 39:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Food</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1157e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 39:7">Genesis 39:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>lifted up her eyes toward</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1164f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 39:14">Genesis 39:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>laugh at</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1171g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 39:21">Genesis 39:21</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Caused him to be viewed with favor by</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-1173h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Genesis 39:23">Genesis 39:23</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>his hand</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
