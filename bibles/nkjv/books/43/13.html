<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>supper being ended, the devil having already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon&#8217;s <i>son,</i> to betray Him, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into His hands, and that He had come from God and was going to God, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>rose from supper and laid aside His garments, took a towel and girded Himself. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>After that, He poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples&#8217; feet, and to wipe <i>them</i> with the towel with which He was girded. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then He came to Simon Peter. And <i>Peter</i> said to Him, &#8220;Lord, are You washing my feet?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Jesus answered and said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;What I am doing you</span> <span class="woj">do not understand now,</span> <span class="woj">but you will know after this.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Peter said to Him, &#8220;You shall never wash my feet!&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text John-13-8">Jesus answered him, <span class="woj">&#8220;If I do not wash you, you have no part with Me.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Simon Peter said to Him, &#8220;Lord, not my feet only, but also <i>my</i> hands and <i>my</i> head!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Jesus said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;He who is bathed needs only to wash <i>his</i> feet, but is completely clean; and</span> <span class="woj">you are clean, but not all of you.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For He knew who would betray Him; therefore He said, <span class="woj">&#8220;You are not all clean.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So when He had washed their feet, taken His garments, and sat down again, He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Do you</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span><span class="woj">know what I have done to you?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span><span class="woj">You call Me Teacher and Lord, and you say well, for <i>so</i> I am.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span><span class="woj">If I then, <i>your</i> Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet,</span> <span class="woj">you also ought to wash one another&#8217;s feet.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span><span class="woj">For</span> <span class="woj">I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span><span class="woj">Most assuredly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master; nor is he who is sent greater than he who sent him.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span><span class="woj">If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.</span></span></p> <h3>
Jesus Identifies His Betrayer</span></h3><p><span class="text John-13-18"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;I do not speak concerning all of you. I know whom I have chosen; but that the</span> <span class="woj">Scripture may be fulfilled,</span> <span class="woj">&#8216;He who eats</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span><span class="woj">bread with Me has lifted up his heel against Me.&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span><span class="woj">Now I tell you before it comes, that when it does come to pass, you may believe that I am <i>He.</i></span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span><span class="woj">Most assuredly, I say to you, he who receives whomever I send receives Me; and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>When Jesus had said these things, He was troubled in spirit, and testified and said, <span class="woj">&#8220;Most assuredly, I say to you,</span> <span class="woj">one of you will betray Me.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then the disciples looked at one another, perplexed about whom He spoke.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Now there was <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>leaning on Jesus&#8217; bosom one of His disciples, whom Jesus loved. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Simon Peter therefore motioned to him to ask who it was of whom He spoke.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then, leaning <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>back on Jesus&#8217; breast, he said to Him, &#8220;Lord, who is it?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Jesus answered, <span class="woj">&#8220;It is he to whom I shall give a piece of bread when I have dipped <i>it.</i>&#8221;</span> And having dipped the bread, He gave <i>it</i> to Judas Iscariot, <i>the son</i> of Simon. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Now after the piece of bread, Satan entered him. Then Jesus said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;What you do, do quickly.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>But no one at the table knew for what reason He said this to him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>For some thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus had said to him, &#8220;Buy <i>those things</i> we need for the feast,&#8221; or that he should give something to the poor.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Having received the piece of bread, he then went out immediately. And it was night.</span></p> <h3>
The New Commandment</span></h3><p><span class="text John-13-31"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>So, when he had gone out, Jesus said, <span class="woj">&#8220;Now the Son of Man is glorified, and</span> <span class="woj">God is glorified in Him.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span><span class="woj">If God is glorified in Him, God will also glorify Him in Himself, and</span> <span class="woj">glorify Him immediately.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span><span class="woj">Little children, I shall be with you a</span> <span class="woj">little while longer. You will seek Me;</span> <span class="woj">and as I said to the Jews, &#8216;Where I am going, you cannot come,&#8217; so now I say to you.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span><span class="woj">A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span><span class="woj">By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Jesus Predicts Peter&#8217;s Denial</span></h3><p><span class="text John-13-36"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Simon Peter said to Him, &#8220;Lord, where are You going?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text John-13-36">Jesus answered him, <span class="woj">&#8220;Where I</span> <span class="woj">am going you cannot follow Me now, but</span> <span class="woj">you shall follow Me afterward.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>Peter said to Him, &#8220;Lord, why can I not follow You now? I will lay down my life for Your sake.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>Jesus answered him, <span class="woj">&#8220;Will you lay down your life for My sake?
