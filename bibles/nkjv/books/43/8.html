<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Now <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>early in the morning He came again into the temple, and all the people came to Him; and He sat down and taught them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then the scribes and Pharisees brought to Him a woman caught in adultery. And when they had set her in the midst, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>they said to Him, &#8220;Teacher, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>this woman was caught in adultery, in the very act. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Moses, in the law, commanded us <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>that such should be stoned.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>This they said, testing Him, that they might have <i>something</i> of which to accuse Him. But Jesus stooped down and wrote on the ground with <i>His</i> finger, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>as though He did not hear.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So when they continued asking Him, He <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>raised Himself up and said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;He who is without sin among you, let him throw a stone at her first.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And again He stooped down and wrote on the ground. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then those who heard <i>it,</i> being<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span> convicted by <i>their</i> conscience, went out one by one, beginning with the oldest <i>even</i> to the last. And Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>When Jesus had raised Himself up <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>and saw no one but the woman, He said to her, <span class="woj">&#8220;Woman, where are those accusers</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span><span class="woj">of yours?

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>She said, &#8220;No one, Lord.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text John-8-11">And Jesus said to her, <span class="woj">&#8220;Neither do I condemn you; go</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span><span class="woj">and</span> <span class="woj">sin no more.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then Jesus spoke to them again, saying, <span class="woj">&#8220;I am the light of the world.

Jesus Defends His Self-Witness</span></h3><p><span class="text John-8-13"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>The Pharisees therefore said to Him, &#8220;You bear witness of Yourself; Your witness is not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[l]</a></span>true.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Jesus answered and said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Even if I bear witness of Myself, My witness is true, for I know where I came from and where I am going; but</span> <span class="woj">you do not know where I come from and where I am going.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span><span class="woj">You judge according to the flesh;</span> <span class="woj">I judge no one.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span><span class="woj">And yet if I do judge, My judgment is true; for</span> <span class="woj">I am not alone, but I <i>am</i> with the Father who sent Me.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span><span class="woj">It is also written in your law that the testimony of two men is true.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span><span class="woj">I am One who bears witness of Myself, and</span> <span class="woj">the Father who sent Me bears witness of Me.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then they said to Him, &#8220;Where is Your Father?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text John-8-19">Jesus answered, <span class="woj">&#8220;You know neither Me nor My Father.</span> <span class="woj">If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>These words Jesus spoke in the treasury, as He taught in the temple; and no one laid hands on Him, for His hour had not yet come.</span></p> <h3>
Jesus Predicts His Departure</span></h3><p><span class="text John-8-21"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then Jesus said to them again, <span class="woj">&#8220;I am going away, and</span> <span class="woj">you will seek Me, and</span> <span class="woj">will die in your sin. Where I go you cannot come.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So the Jews said, &#8220;Will He kill Himself, because He says, <span class="woj">&#8216;Where I go you cannot come&#8217;</span>?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;You are from beneath; I am from above.</span> <span class="woj">You are of this world; I am not of this world.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span><span class="woj">Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins;</span> <span class="woj">for if you do not believe that I am <i>He,</i> you will die in your sins.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then they said to Him, &#8220;Who are You?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text John-8-25">And Jesus said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Just what I</span> <span class="woj">have been saying to you from the beginning.</span> </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>They did not understand that He spoke to them of the Father.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then Jesus said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;When you</span> <span class="woj">lift</span><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[m]</a></span> <span class="woj">up the Son of Man,</span> <span class="woj">then you will know that I am <i>He,</i> and</span> <span class="woj"><i>that</i> I do nothing of Myself; but</span> <span class="woj">as My Father taught Me, I speak these things.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span><span class="woj">And</span> <span class="woj">He who sent Me is with Me.</span> <span class="woj">The Father has not left Me alone,</span> <span class="woj">for I always do those things that please Him.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>As He spoke these words, many believed in Him.</span></p> <h3>
The Truth Shall Make You Free</span></h3><p><span class="text John-8-31"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him, <span class="woj">&#8220;If you</span> <span class="woj">abide in My word, you are My disciples indeed.</span> </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>They answered Him, &#8220;We are Abraham&#8217;s descendants, and have never been in bondage to anyone. How <i>can</i> You say, <span class="woj">&#8216;You will be made free&#8217;</span>?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Jesus answered them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Most assuredly, I say to you,</span> <span class="woj">whoever commits sin is a slave of sin.</span> </span>
