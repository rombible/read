<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Simon Peter, Thomas called the Twin, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the <i>sons</i> of Zebedee, and two others of His disciples were together. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Simon Peter said to them, &#8220;I am going fishing.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text John-21-3">They said to him, &#8220;We are going with you also.&#8221; They went out and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>immediately got into the boat, and that night they caught nothing. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But when the morning had now come, Jesus stood on the shore; yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then Jesus said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Children, have you any food?&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span class="text John-21-5">They answered Him, &#8220;No.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find <i>some.</i>&#8221;</span> So they cast, and now they were not able to draw it in because of the multitude of fish.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, &#8220;It is the Lord!&#8221; Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on <i>his</i> outer garment (for he had removed it), and plunged into the sea. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But the other disciples came in the little boat (for they were not far from land, but about two hundred cubits), dragging the net with fish. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then, as soon as they had come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Jesus said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Bring some of the fish which you have just caught.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Simon Peter went up and dragged the net to land, full of large fish, one hundred and fifty-three; and although there were so many, the net was not broken. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Jesus said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Come <i>and</i> eat breakfast.&#8221;</span> Yet none of the disciples dared ask Him, &#8220;Who are You?&#8221;&#8212;knowing that it was the Lord. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Jesus then came and took the bread and gave it to them, and likewise the fish.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>This <i>is</i> now the third time Jesus showed Himself to His disciples after He was raised from the dead.</span></p> <h3>
Jesus Restores Peter</span></h3><p><span class="text John-21-15"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So when they had eaten breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, <span class="woj">&#8220;Simon, <i>son</i> of</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span><span class="woj">Jonah, do you love Me more than these?&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span class="text John-21-15">He said to Him, &#8220;Yes, Lord; You know that I <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>love You.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text John-21-15">He said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;Feed My lambs.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>He said to him again a second time, <span class="woj">&#8220;Simon, <i>son</i> of</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span><span class="woj">Jonah, do you love Me?&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span class="text John-21-16">He said to Him, &#8220;Yes, Lord; You know that I <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>love You.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text John-21-16">He said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;Tend My</span> <span class="woj">sheep.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>He said to him the third time, <span class="woj">&#8220;Simon, <i>son</i> of</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span><span class="woj">Jonah, do you</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span><span class="woj">love Me?&#8221;</span> Peter was grieved because He said to him the third time, <span class="woj">&#8220;Do you love Me?&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span class="text John-21-17">And he said to Him, &#8220;Lord, You know all things; You know that I love You.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text John-21-17">Jesus said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;Feed My sheep.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span><span class="woj">Most assuredly, I say to you, when you were younger, you girded yourself and walked where you wished; but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry <i>you</i> where you do not wish.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>This He spoke, signifying by what death he would glorify God. And when He had spoken this, He said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;Follow Me.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
The Beloved Disciple and His Book</span></h3><p><span class="text John-21-20"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then Peter, turning around, saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following, who also had leaned on His breast at the supper, and said, &#8220;Lord, who is the one who betrays You?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Peter, seeing him, said to Jesus, &#8220;But Lord, what <i>about</i> this man?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Jesus said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;If I</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span><span class="woj">will that he remain</span> <span class="woj">till I come, what <i>is that</i> to you? You follow Me.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Then this saying went out among the brethren that this disciple would not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but, <span class="woj">&#8220;If I will that he remain till I come, what <i>is that</i> to you?&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>This is the disciple who testifies of these things, and wrote these things; and we know that his testimony is true.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And there are also many other things that Jesus did, which if they were written one by one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that would be written. Amen.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-26902a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to John 21:3">John 21:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>immediately</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-26914b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to John 21:15">John 21:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>John</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-26914c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to John 21:15">John 21:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>have affection for</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-26915d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to John 21:16">John 21:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>John</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-26915e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to John 21:16">John 21:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>have affection for</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-26916f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to John 21:17">John 21:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>John</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-26916g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to John 21:17">John 21:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>have affection for</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-26921h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to John 21:22">John 21:22</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>desire</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
