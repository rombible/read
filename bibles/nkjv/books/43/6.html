<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then a great multitude followed Him, because they saw His signs which He performed on those who were diseased.<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And Jesus went up on the mountain, and there He sat with His disciples.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Now the Passover, a feast of the Jews, was near. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then Jesus lifted up <i>His</i> eyes, and seeing a great multitude coming toward Him, He said to Philip, <span class="woj">&#8220;Where shall we buy bread, that these may eat?&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But this He said to test him, for He Himself knew what He would do.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Philip answered Him, &#8220;Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may have a little.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter&#8217;s brother, said to Him, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;There is a lad here who has five barley loaves and two small fish, but what are they among so many?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then Jesus said, <span class="woj">&#8220;Make the people sit down.&#8221;</span> Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And Jesus took the loaves, and when He had given thanks He distributed <i>them</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>to the disciples, and the disciples to those sitting down; and likewise of the fish, as much as they wanted. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So when they were filled, He said to His disciples, <span class="woj">&#8220;Gather up the fragments that remain, so that nothing is lost.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Therefore they gathered <i>them</i> up, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves which were left over by those who had eaten. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then those men, when they had seen the sign that Jesus did, said, &#8220;This is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Jesus Walks on the Sea</span></h3><p><span class="text John-6-15"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Therefore when Jesus perceived that they were about to come and take Him by force to make Him king, He departed again to the mountain by Himself alone.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Now when evening came, His disciples went down to the sea, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>got into the boat, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was already dark, and Jesus had not come to them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then the sea arose because a great wind was blowing. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>So when they had rowed about <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near the boat; and they were afraid. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>But He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;It is I; do not be afraid.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then they willingly received Him into the boat, and immediately the boat was at the land where they were going.</span></p> <h3>
The Bread from Heaven</span></h3><p><span class="text John-6-22"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>On the following day, when the people who were standing on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, except <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>that one <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>which His disciples had entered, and that Jesus had not entered the boat with His disciples, but His disciples had gone away alone&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>however, other boats came from Tiberias, near the place where they ate bread after the Lord had given thanks&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>when the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, nor His disciples, they also got into boats and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And when they found Him on the other side of the sea, they said to Him, &#8220;Rabbi, when did You come here?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Jesus answered them and said, <span class="woj">&#8220;Most assuredly, I say to you, you seek Me, not because you saw the signs, but because you ate of the loaves and were filled.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span><span class="woj">Do not labor for the food which perishes, but</span> <span class="woj">for the food which endures to everlasting life, which the Son of Man will give you,</span> <span class="woj">because God the Father has set His seal on Him.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then they said to Him, &#8220;What shall we do, that we may work the works of God?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Jesus answered and said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;This is the work of God, that you believe in Him whom He sent.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Therefore they said to Him, &#8220;What sign will You perform then, that we may see it and believe You? What work will You do? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Our fathers ate the manna in the desert; as it is written, <span class="oblique">&#8216;He gave them bread from heaven to eat.&#8217;</span> &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Then Jesus said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Most assuredly, I say to you, Moses did not give you the bread from heaven, but</span> <span class="woj">My Father gives you the true bread from heaven.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span><span class="woj">For the bread of God is He who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Then they said to Him, &#8220;Lord, give us this bread always.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>And Jesus said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;I am the bread of life.</span> <span class="woj">He who comes to Me shall never hunger, and he who believes in Me shall never</span> <span class="woj">thirst.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span><span class="woj">But I said to you that you have seen Me and yet</span> <span class="woj">do not believe.</span> </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span><span class="woj">For I have come down from heaven,</span> <span class="woj">not to do My own will,</span> <span class="woj">but the will of Him who sent Me.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span><span class="woj">This is the will of the Father who sent Me,</span> <span class="woj">that of all He has given Me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up at the last day.</span> </span>
