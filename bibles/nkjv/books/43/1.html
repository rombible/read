John&#8217;s Witness: The True Light</span></h3><p><span class="text John-1-6"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>There was a man sent from God, whose name <i>was</i> John. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>This man came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all through him might believe. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>He was not that Light, but <i>was sent</i> to bear witness of that Light. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>That<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span> was the true Light which gives light to every man coming into the world.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>He was in the world, and the world was made through Him, and the world did not know Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>He came to His <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>own, and His <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>own did not receive Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But as many as received Him, to them He gave the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>right to become children of God, to those who believe in His name: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</span></p> <h3>
The Word Becomes Flesh</span></h3><p><span class="text John-1-14"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>John bore witness of Him and cried out, saying, &#8220;This was He of whom I said, &#8216;He who comes after me <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>is preferred before me, for He was before me.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>And of His fullness we have all received, and grace for grace. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>For the law was given through Moses, <i>but</i> grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>No one has seen God at any time. The only begotten <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared <i>Him.</i></span></p> <h3>
A Voice in the Wilderness</span></h3><p><span class="text John-1-19"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Now this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, &#8220;Who are you?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>He confessed, and did not deny, but confessed, &#8220;I am not the Christ.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And they asked him, &#8220;What then?

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Now those who were sent were from the Pharisees. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And they asked him, saying, &#8220;Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>John answered them, saying, &#8220;I baptize with water, but there stands One among you whom you do not know. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>It is He who, coming after me, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>is preferred before me, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to loose.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>These things were done in <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>Bethabara beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</span></p> <h3>
The Lamb of God</span></h3><p><span class="text John-1-29"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, &#8220;Behold! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>This is He of whom I said, &#8216;After me comes a Man who <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span>is preferred before me, for He was before me.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>I did not know Him; but that He should be revealed to Israel, therefore I came baptizing with water.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And John bore witness, saying, &#8220;I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and He remained upon Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>I did not know Him, but He who sent me to baptize with water said to me, &#8216;Upon whom you see the Spirit descending, and remaining on Him, this is He who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>And I have seen and testified that this is the Son of God.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
The First Disciples</span></h3><p><span class="text John-1-35"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Again, the next day, John stood with two of his disciples. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>And looking at Jesus as He walked, he said, &#8220;Behold the Lamb of God!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>Then Jesus turned, and seeing them following, said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;What do you seek?&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span class="text John-1-38">They said to Him, &#8220;Rabbi&#8221; (which is to say, when translated, Teacher), &#8220;where are You staying?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Come and see.&#8221;</span> They came and saw where He was staying, and remained with Him that day (now it was about the tenth hour).</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>One of the two who heard John <i>speak,</i> and followed Him, was Andrew, Simon Peter&#8217;s brother. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>He first found his own brother Simon, and said to him, &#8220;We have found the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[l]</a></span>Messiah&#8221; (which is translated, the Christ). </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>And he brought him to Jesus.</span></p><p><span class="text John-1-42">Now when Jesus looked at him, He said, <span class="woj">&#8220;You are Simon the son of</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[m]</a></span><span class="woj">Jonah.</span> <span class="woj">You shall be called Cephas&#8221;</span> (which is translated, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[n]</a></span>A Stone).</span></p> <h3>
Philip and Nathanael</span></h3><p><span class="text John-1-43"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>The following day Jesus wanted to go to Galilee, and He found Philip and said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;Follow Me.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>Philip found Nathanael and said to him, &#8220;We have found Him of whom Moses in the law, and also the prophets, wrote&#8212;Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span>And Nathanael said to him, &#8220;Can anything good come out of Nazareth?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text John-1-46">Philip said to him, &#8220;Come and see.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-47.htm"><b>47</b></a></span>Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward Him, and said of him, <span class="woj">&#8220;Behold,</span> <span class="woj">an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit!&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-48.htm"><b>48</b></a></span>Nathanael said to Him, &#8220;How do You know me?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text John-1-48">Jesus answered and said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
