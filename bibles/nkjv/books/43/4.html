<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>(though Jesus Himself did not baptize, but His disciples), </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>He left Judea and departed again to Galilee. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But He needed to go through Samaria.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So He came to a city of Samaria which is called Sychar, near the plot of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now Jacob&#8217;s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied from <i>His</i> journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, <span class="woj">&#8220;Give Me a drink.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For His disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then the woman of Samaria said to Him, &#8220;How is it that You, being a Jew, ask a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?&#8221; For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Jesus answered and said to her, <span class="woj">&#8220;If you knew the</span> <span class="woj">gift of God, and who it is who says to you, &#8216;Give Me a drink,&#8217; you would have asked Him, and He would have given you</span> <span class="woj">living water.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>The woman said to Him, &#8220;Sir, You have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. Where then do You get that living water? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Are You greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank from it himself, as well as his sons and his livestock?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Jesus answered and said to her, <span class="woj">&#8220;Whoever drinks of this water will thirst again,</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span><span class="woj">but</span> <span class="woj">whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst. But the water that I shall give him</span> <span class="woj">will become in him a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>The woman said to Him, &#8220;Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come here to draw.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Jesus said to her, <span class="woj">&#8220;Go, call your husband, and come here.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>The woman answered and said, &#8220;I have no husband.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text John-4-17">Jesus said to her, <span class="woj">&#8220;You have well said, &#8216;I have no husband,&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span><span class="woj">for you have had five husbands, and the one whom you now have is not your husband; in that you spoke truly.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>The woman said to Him, &#8220;Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, and you <i>Jews</i> say that in Jerusalem is the place where one ought to worship.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Jesus said to her, <span class="woj">&#8220;Woman, believe Me, the hour is coming</span> <span class="woj">when you will neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, worship the Father.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span><span class="woj">You worship</span> <span class="woj">what you do not know; we know what we worship, for</span> <span class="woj">salvation is of the Jews.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span><span class="woj">But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will</span> <span class="woj">worship the Father in</span> <span class="woj">spirit</span> <span class="woj">and truth; for the Father is seeking such to worship Him.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span><span class="woj">God <i>is</i> Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>The woman said to Him, &#8220;I know that Messiah is coming&#8221; (who is called Christ). &#8220;When He comes, He will tell us all things.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Jesus said to her, <span class="woj">&#8220;I who speak to you am <i>He.</i>&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
The Whitened Harvest</span></h3><p><span class="text John-4-27"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And at this <i>point</i> His disciples came, and they marveled that He talked with a woman; yet no one said, &#8220;What do You seek?&#8221; or, &#8220;Why are You talking with her?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>The woman then left her waterpot, went her way into the city, and said to the men, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>&#8220;Come, see a Man who told me all things that I ever did. Could this be the Christ?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Then they went out of the city and came to Him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>In the meantime His disciples urged Him, saying, &#8220;Rabbi, eat.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>But He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;I have food to eat of which you do not know.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Therefore the disciples said to one another, &#8220;Has anyone brought Him <i>anything</i> to eat?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Jesus said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me, and to</span> <span class="woj">finish His work.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span><span class="woj">Do you not say, &#8216;There are still four months and <i>then</i> comes</span> <span class="woj">the harvest&#8217;? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes and look at the fields,</span> <span class="woj">for they are already white for harvest!</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span><span class="woj">And he who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit for eternal life, that</span> <span class="woj">both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span><span class="woj">For in this the saying is true:</span> <span class="woj">&#8216;One sows and another reaps.&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span><span class="woj">I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored;</span> <span class="woj">others have labored, and you have entered into their labors.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
The Savior of the World</span></h3><p><span class="text John-4-39"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>And many of the Samaritans of that city believed in Him because of the word of the woman who testified, &#8220;He told me all that I <i>ever</i> did.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>So when the Samaritans had come to Him, they urged Him to stay with them; and He stayed there two days. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>And many more believed because of His own word.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>Then they said to the woman, &#8220;Now we believe, not because of what you said, for we ourselves have heard <i>Him</i> and we know that this is indeed <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>the Christ, the Savior of the world.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Welcome at Galilee</span></h3><p><span class="text John-4-43"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>Now after the two days He departed from there and went to Galilee. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>For Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>So when He came to Galilee, the Galileans received Him, having seen all the things He did in Jerusalem at the feast; for they also had gone to the feast.</span></p> <h3>
A Nobleman&#8217;s Son Healed</span></h3><p><span class="text John-4-46"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span>So Jesus came again to Cana of Galilee where He had made the water wine. And there was a certain <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-47.htm"><b>47</b></a></span>When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to Him and implored Him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-48.htm"><b>48</b></a></span>Then Jesus said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;Unless you <i>people</i> see signs and wonders, you will by no means believe.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-49.htm"><b>49</b></a></span>The nobleman said to Him, &#8220;Sir, come down before my child dies!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-50.htm"><b>50</b></a></span>Jesus said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;Go your way; your son lives.&#8221;</span> So the man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went his way. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-51.htm"><b>51</b></a></span>And as he was now going down, his servants met him and told <i>him,</i> saying, &#8220;Your son lives!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-52.htm"><b>52</b></a></span>Then he inquired of them the hour when he got better. And they said to him, &#8220;Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-53.htm"><b>53</b></a></span>So the father knew that <i>it was</i> at the same hour in which Jesus said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;Your son lives.&#8221;</span> And he himself believed, and his whole household.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-54.htm"><b>54</b></a></span>This again <i>is</i> the second sign Jesus did when He had come out of Judea into Galilee.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-26199a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to John 4:42">John 4:42</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>the Christ</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-26203b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to John 4:46">John 4:46</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>royal official</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
