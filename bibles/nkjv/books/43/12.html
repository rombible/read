<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>There they made Him a supper; and Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then Mary took a pound of very costly oil of spikenard, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped His feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the oil.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But one of His disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon&#8217;s <i>son,</i> who would betray Him, said, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8220;Why was this fragrant oil not sold for <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>three hundred denarii and given to the poor?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and had the money box; and he used to take what was put in it.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But Jesus said, <span class="woj">&#8220;Let her alone;</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span><span class="woj">she has kept this for the day of My burial.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><span class="woj">For</span> <span class="woj">the poor you have with you always, but Me you do not have always.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
The Plot to Kill Lazarus</span></h3><p><span class="text John-12-9"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Now a great many of the Jews knew that He was there; and they came, not for Jesus&#8217; sake only, but that they might also see Lazarus, whom He had raised from the dead. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>But the chief priests plotted to put Lazarus to death also, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>because on account of him many of the Jews went away and believed in Jesus.</span></p> <h3>
The Triumphal Entry</span></h3><p><span class="text John-12-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>The next day a great multitude that had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>took branches of palm trees and went out to meet Him, and cried out:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text John-12-13">&#8220;Hosanna!</span><br /><span class="text John-12-13"><span class="oblique">&#8216;Blessed</span> <i>is</i> <span class="oblique">He who comes in the name of the</span> <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span><span class="oblique">!&#8217;</span></span><br /><span class="text John-12-13">The King of Israel!&#8221;</span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then Jesus, when He had found a young donkey, sat on it; as it is written:</span></p> <div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line">

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>His disciples did not understand these things at first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about Him and <i>that</i> they had done these things to Him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Therefore the people, who were with Him when He called Lazarus out of his tomb and raised him from the dead, bore witness. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>For this reason the people also met Him, because they heard that He had done this sign. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, &#8220;You see that you are accomplishing nothing. Look, the world has gone after Him!&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
The Fruitful Grain of Wheat</span></h3><p><span class="text John-12-20"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Now there were certain Greeks among those who came up to worship at the feast. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then they came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, &#8220;Sir, we wish to see Jesus.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Philip came and told Andrew, and in turn Andrew and Philip told Jesus.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>But Jesus answered them, saying, <span class="woj">&#8220;The hour has come that the Son of Man should be glorified.</span> </span>

Jesus Predicts His Death on the Cross</span></h3><p><span class="text John-12-27"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;Now My soul is troubled, and what shall I say? &#8216;Father, save Me from this hour&#8217;?</span> <span class="woj">But for this purpose I came to this hour.</span> </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Therefore the people who stood by and heard <i>it</i> said that it had thundered. Others said, &#8220;An angel has spoken to Him.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Jesus answered and said, <span class="woj">&#8220;This voice did not come because of Me, but for your sake.</span> </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>This He said, signifying by what death He would die.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>The people answered Him, &#8220;We have heard from the law that the Christ remains forever; and how <i>can</i> You say, <span class="woj">&#8216;The Son of Man must be lifted up&#8217;</span>?

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Then Jesus said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;A little while longer</span> <span class="woj">the light is with you.</span> <span class="woj">Walk while you have the light, lest darkness overtake you;</span> <span class="woj">he who walks in darkness does not know where he is going.</span> </span>
