<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span><span class="woj">But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span><span class="woj">To him the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep hear his voice; and he calls his own sheep by</span> <span class="woj">name and leads them out.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span><span class="woj">And when he brings out his own sheep, he goes before them; and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice.</span> </span>

Jesus the Good Shepherd</span></h3><p><span class="text John-10-7"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then Jesus said to them again, <span class="woj">&#8220;Most assuredly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.</span> </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span><span class="woj">I am the door. If anyone enters by Me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><span class="woj">The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I have come that they may have life, and that they may have <i>it</i> more abundantly.</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd gives His life for the sheep.</span> </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span><span class="woj">The hireling flees because he is a hireling and does not care about the sheep.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span><span class="woj">I am the good shepherd; and</span> <span class="woj">I know My <i>sheep,</i> and</span> <span class="woj">am known by My own.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span><span class="woj">As the Father knows Me, even so I know the Father;</span> <span class="woj">and I lay down My life for the sheep.</span> </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Therefore there was a division again among the Jews because of these sayings. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And many of them said, &#8220;He has a demon and is <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>mad. Why do you listen to Him?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Others said, &#8220;These are not the words of one who has a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?&#8221;</span></p> <h3>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then the Jews surrounded Him and said to Him, &#8220;How long do You keep us in <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>doubt? If You are the Christ, tell us plainly.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Jesus answered them, <span class="woj">&#8220;I told you, and you do not believe.</span> <span class="woj">The works that I do in My Father&#8217;s name, they</span> <span class="woj">bear witness of Me.</span> </span>

Renewed Efforts to Stone Jesus</span></h3><p><span class="text John-10-31"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Then the Jews took up stones again to stone Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Jesus answered them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Many good works I have shown you from My Father. For which of those works do you stone Me?&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>The Jews answered Him, saying, &#8220;For a good work we do not stone You, but for blasphemy, and because You, being a Man, make Yourself God.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Jesus answered them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Is it not written in your law,</span> <span class="woj">&#8216;I said, &#8220;You are gods&#8221; &#8217;?</span> </span>
