<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>This man came to Jesus by night and said to Him, &#8220;Rabbi, we know that You are a teacher come from God; for no one can do these signs that You do unless God is with him.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Jesus answered and said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;Most assuredly, I say to you,</span> <span class="woj">unless one is born</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span><span class="woj">again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Nicodemus said to Him, &#8220;How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother&#8217;s womb and be born?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Jesus answered, <span class="woj">&#8220;Most assuredly, I say to you,</span> <span class="woj">unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span><span class="woj">That which is born of the flesh is</span> <span class="woj">flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span><span class="woj">Do not marvel that I said to you, &#8216;You must be born again.&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><span class="woj">The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear the sound of it, but cannot tell where it comes from and where it goes. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Nicodemus answered and said to Him, &#8220;How can these things be?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Jesus answered and said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;Are you the teacher of Israel, and do not know these things?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span><span class="woj">Most assuredly, I say to you, We speak what We know and testify what We have seen, and</span> <span class="woj">you do not receive Our witness.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span><span class="woj">If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span><span class="woj">No one has ascended to heaven but He who came down from heaven, <i>that is,</i> the Son of Man</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span><span class="woj">who is in heaven.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span><span class="woj">And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so</span> <span class="woj">must the Son of Man be lifted up,</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span><span class="woj">that whoever</span> <span class="woj">believes in Him should</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span><span class="woj">not perish but</span> <span class="woj">have eternal life.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/3-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span><span class="woj">For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten</span> <span class="woj">Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span><span class="woj">For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/3-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/3-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span><span class="woj">And this is the condemnation,</span> <span class="woj">that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/3-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span><span class="woj">For</span> <span class="woj">everyone practicing evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/3-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span><span class="woj">But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be clearly seen, that they have been</span> <span class="woj">done in God.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
John the Baptist Exalts Christ</span></h3><p><span class="text John-3-22"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/3-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>After these things Jesus and His disciples came into the land of Judea, and there He remained with them and baptized. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/3-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Now John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there. And they came and were baptized. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/3-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>For John had not yet been thrown into prison.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/3-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then there arose a dispute between <i>some</i> of John&#8217;s disciples and the Jews about purification. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/3-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And they came to John and said to him, &#8220;Rabbi, He who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have testified&#8212;behold, He is baptizing, and all are coming to Him!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/3-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>John answered and said, &#8220;A man can receive nothing unless it has been given to him from heaven. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/3-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>You yourselves bear me witness, that I said, &#8216;I am not the Christ,&#8217; but, &#8216;I have been sent before Him.&#8217; </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/3-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And what He has seen and heard, that He testifies; and no one receives His testimony. </span>
