<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/20-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then she ran and came to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and said to them, &#8220;They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid Him.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/20-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Peter therefore went out, and the other disciple, and were going to the tomb. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/20-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So they both ran together, and the other disciple outran Peter and came to the tomb first. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/20-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And he, stooping down and looking in, saw the linen cloths lying <i>there;</i> yet he did not go in. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/20-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb; and he saw the linen cloths lying <i>there,</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/20-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>handkerchief that had been around His head, not lying with the linen cloths, but folded together in a place by itself. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/20-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then the other disciple, who came to the tomb first, went in also; and he saw and believed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/20-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For as yet they did not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>know the Scripture, that He must rise again from the dead. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/20-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then the disciples went away again to their own homes.</span></p> <h3>
Mary Magdalene Sees the Risen Lord</span></h3><p><span class="text John-20-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/20-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But Mary stood outside by the tomb weeping, and as she wept she stooped down <i>and looked</i> into the tomb. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/20-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And she saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/20-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then they said to her, &#8220;Woman, why are you weeping?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text John-20-13">She said to them, &#8220;Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid Him.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/20-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Now when she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing <i>there,</i> and did not know that it was Jesus. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/20-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Jesus said to her, <span class="woj">&#8220;Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span class="text John-20-15">She, supposing Him to be the gardener, said to Him, &#8220;Sir, if You have carried Him away, tell me where You have laid Him, and I will take Him away.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/20-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Jesus said to her, <span class="woj">&#8220;Mary!&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span class="text John-20-16">She turned and said to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Him, &#8220;Rabboni!&#8221; (which is to say, Teacher).</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/20-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Jesus said to her, <span class="woj">&#8220;Do not cling to Me, for I have not yet</span> <span class="woj">ascended to My Father; but go to</span> <span class="woj">My brethren and say to them,</span> <span class="woj">&#8216;I am ascending to My Father and your Father, and <i>to</i></span> <span class="woj">My God and your God.&#8217; &#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/20-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Mary Magdalene came and told the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>disciples that she had seen the Lord, and <i>that</i> He had spoken these things to her.</span></p> <h3>
The Apostles Commissioned</span></h3><p><span class="text John-20-19"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/20-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then, the same day at evening, being the first <i>day</i> of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>assembled, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Peace <i>be</i> with you.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/20-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>When He had said this, He showed them <i>His</i> hands and His side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/20-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>So Jesus said to them again, <span class="woj">&#8220;Peace to you!</span> <span class="woj">As the Father has sent Me, I also send you.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/20-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And when He had said this, He breathed on <i>them,</i> and said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Receive the Holy Spirit.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/20-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span><span class="woj">If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain the <i>sins</i> of any, they are retained.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Seeing and Believing</span></h3><p><span class="text John-20-24"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/20-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Now Thomas, called the Twin, one of the twelve, was not with them when Jesus came. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/20-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>The other disciples therefore said to him, &#8220;We have seen the Lord.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text John-20-25">So he said to them, &#8220;Unless I see in His hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and put my hand into His side, I will not believe.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/20-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And after eight days His disciples were again inside, and Thomas with them. Jesus came, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, <span class="woj">&#8220;Peace to you!&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/20-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Then He said to Thomas, <span class="woj">&#8220;Reach your finger here, and look at My hands; and</span> <span class="woj">reach your hand <i>here,</i> and put <i>it</i> into My side. Do not be</span> <span class="woj">unbelieving, but believing.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/20-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And Thomas answered and said to Him, &#8220;My Lord and my God!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/20-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Jesus said to him, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;Thomas, because you have seen Me, you have believed.</span> <span class="woj">Blessed <i>are</i> those who have not seen and <i>yet</i> have believed.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
That You May Believe</span></h3><p><span class="text John-20-30"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/20-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And truly Jesus did many other signs in the presence of His disciples, which are not written in this book; </span>
