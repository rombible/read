<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And the soldiers twisted a crown of thorns and put <i>it</i> on His head, and they put on Him a purple robe. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>Then they said, &#8220;Hail, King of the Jews!&#8221; And they struck Him with their hands.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Pilate then went out again, and said to them, &#8220;Behold, I am bringing Him out to you, that you may know that I find no fault in Him.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Pilate&#8217;s Decision</span></h3><p><span class="text John-19-5"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And <i>Pilate</i> said to them, &#8220;Behold the Man!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Therefore, when the chief priests and officers saw Him, they cried out, saying, &#8220;Crucify <i>Him,</i> crucify <i>Him!</i>&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text John-19-6">Pilate said to them, &#8220;You take Him and crucify <i>Him,</i> for I find no fault in Him.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>The Jews answered him, &#8220;We have a law, and according to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>our law He ought to die, because He made Himself the Son of God.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Therefore, when Pilate heard that saying, he was the more afraid, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and went again into the Praetorium, and said to Jesus, &#8220;Where are You from?&#8221; But Jesus gave him no answer.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then Pilate said to Him, &#8220;Are You not speaking to me? Do You not know that I have <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>power to crucify You, and power to release You?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Jesus answered, <span class="woj">&#8220;You could have no power at all against Me unless it had been given you from above. Therefore</span> <span class="woj">the one who delivered Me to you has the greater sin.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>From then on Pilate sought to release Him, but the Jews cried out, saying, &#8220;If you let this Man go, you are not Caesar&#8217;s friend. Whoever makes himself a king speaks against Caesar.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus out and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called <i>The</i> Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Now it was the Preparation Day of the Passover, and about the sixth hour. And he said to the Jews, &#8220;Behold your King!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But they cried out, &#8220;Away with <i>Him,</i> away with <i>Him!</i> Crucify Him!&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text John-19-15">Pilate said to them, &#8220;Shall I crucify your King?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text John-19-15">The chief priests answered, &#8220;We have no king but Caesar!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then he delivered Him to them to be crucified. Then they took Jesus <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>and led <i>Him</i> away.</span></p> <h3>
The King on a Cross</span></h3><p><span class="text John-19-17"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And He, bearing His cross, went out to a place called <i>the Place</i> of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>where they crucified Him, and two others with Him, one on either side, and Jesus in the center. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Now Pilate wrote a title and put <i>it</i> on the cross. And the writing was:</span></p><p class="center_top-1"><span class="text John-19-19">JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span></p> <p class="first-line-none top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, <i>and</i> Latin.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Therefore the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, &#8220;Do not write, &#8216;The King of the Jews,&#8217; but, &#8216;He said, &#8220;I am the King of the Jews.&#8221; &#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Pilate answered, &#8220;What I have written, I have written.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took His garments and made four parts, to each soldier a part, and also the tunic. Now the tunic was without seam, woven from the top in one piece. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>They said therefore among themselves, &#8220;Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be,&#8221; that the Scripture might be fulfilled which says:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text John-19-24"><span class="oblique">&#8220;They divided My garments among them,</span></span><br /><span class="text John-19-24"><span class="oblique">And for My clothing they cast lots.&#8221;</span></span></p></div><p class="first-line-none top-1"><span class="text John-19-24">Therefore the soldiers did these things.</span></p> <h3>
Behold Your Mother</span></h3><p><span class="text John-19-25"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Now there stood by the cross of Jesus His mother, and His mother&#8217;s sister, Mary the <i>wife</i> of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>When Jesus therefore saw His mother, and the disciple whom He loved standing by, He said to His mother, <span class="woj">&#8220;Woman, behold your son!&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Then He said to the disciple, <span class="woj">&#8220;Behold your mother!&#8221;</span> And from that hour that disciple took her to his own <i>home.</i></span></p> <h3>
It Is Finished</span></h3><p><span class="text John-19-28"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>After this, Jesus, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, <span class="woj">&#8220;I thirst!&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Now a vessel full of sour wine was sitting there; and they filled a sponge with sour wine, put <i>it</i> on hyssop, and put <i>it</i> to His mouth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>So when Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, <span class="woj">&#8220;It is finished!&#8221;</span> And bowing His head, He gave up His spirit.</span></p> <h3>
Jesus&#8217; Side Is Pierced</span></h3><p><span class="text John-19-31"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Therefore, because it was the Preparation <i>Day,</i> that the bodies should not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and <i>that</i> they might be taken away. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and of the other who was crucified with Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>But when they came to Jesus and saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>And he who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true; and he knows that he is telling the truth, so that you may believe. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>For these things were done that the Scripture should be fulfilled, <span class="oblique">&#8220;Not</span> <i>one</i> <span class="oblique">of His bones shall be broken.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>And again another Scripture says, <span class="oblique">&#8220;They shall look on Him whom they pierced.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Jesus Buried in Joseph&#8217;s Tomb</span></h3><p><span class="text John-19-38"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>After this, Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly, for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave <i>him</i> permission. So he came and took the body of Jesus. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>And Nicodemus, who at first came to Jesus by night, also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>Then they took the body of Jesus, and bound it in strips of linen with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>So there they laid Jesus, because of the Jews&#8217; Preparation <i>Day,</i> for the tomb was nearby.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-26829a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to John 19:3">John 19:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>And they came up to Him and said</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-26833b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to John 19:7">John 19:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>the law</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-26836c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to John 19:10">John 19:10</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>authority</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-26842d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to John 19:16">John 19:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>and led Him away</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-26854e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to John 19:28">John 19:28</span> <span class='footnote-text'>M <i>seeing</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
