<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Now both Jesus and His disciples were invited to the wedding. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And when they ran out of wine, the mother of Jesus said to Him, &#8220;They have no wine.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Jesus said to her, <span class="woj">&#8220;Woman,</span> <span class="woj">what does your concern have to do with Me?</span> <span class="woj">My hour has not yet come.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>His mother said to the servants, &#8220;Whatever He says to you, do <i>it.</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now there were set there six waterpots of stone, according to the manner of purification of the Jews, containing twenty or thirty gallons apiece. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Jesus said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Fill the waterpots with water.&#8221;</span> And they filled them up to the brim. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Draw <i>some</i> out now, and take <i>it</i> to the master of the feast.&#8221;</span> And they took <i>it.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>When the master of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and did not know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the master of the feast called the bridegroom. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And he said to him, &#8220;Every man at the beginning sets out the good wine, and when the <i>guests</i> have well drunk, then the inferior. You have kept the good wine until now!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>This beginning of signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>manifested His glory; and His disciples believed in Him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>After this He went down to Capernaum, He, His mother, His brothers, and His disciples; and they did not stay there many days.</span></p> <h3>
Jesus Cleanses the Temple</span></h3><p><span class="text John-2-13"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And He found in the temple those who sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the money changers <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>doing business. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>When He had made a whip of cords, He drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and the oxen, and poured out the changers&#8217; money and overturned the tables. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And He said to those who sold doves, <span class="woj">&#8220;Take these things away! Do not make</span> <span class="woj">My Father&#8217;s house a house of merchandise!&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then His disciples remembered that it was written, <span class="oblique">&#8220;Zeal for Your house</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span><span class="oblique">has eaten Me up.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>So the Jews answered and said to Him, &#8220;What sign do You show to us, since You do these things?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Jesus answered and said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then the Jews said, &#8220;It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will You raise it up in three days?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>But He was speaking of the temple of His body. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Therefore, when He had risen from the dead, His disciples remembered that He had said this <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>to them; and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had said.</span></p> <h3>
The Discerner of Hearts</span></h3><p><span class="text John-2-23"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in His name when they saw the signs which He did. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>But Jesus did not commit Himself to them, because He knew all <i>men,</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>and had no need that anyone should testify of man, for He knew what was in man.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-26107a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to John 2:11">John 2:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>revealed</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-26110b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to John 2:14">John 2:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>sitting</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-26113c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to John 2:17">John 2:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M <i>will eat</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-26118d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to John 2:22">John 2:22</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M omit <i>to them</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
