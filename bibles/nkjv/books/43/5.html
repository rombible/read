<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Now there is in Jerusalem by the Sheep <i>Gate</i> a pool, which is called in Hebrew, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>Bethesda, having five porches. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>In these lay a great multitude of sick people, blind, lame, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>paralyzed, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>waiting for the moving of the water. </span> 
4For an angel went down at a certain time into the pool and stirred up the water; then whoever stepped in first, after the stirring of the water, was made well of whatever disease he had. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now a certain man was there who had an infirmity thirty-eight years. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he already had been <i>in that condition</i> a long time, He said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;Do you want to be made well?&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>The sick man answered Him, &#8220;Sir, I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up; but while I am coming, another steps down before me.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Jesus said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;Rise, take up your bed and walk.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And immediately the man was made well, took up his bed, and walked.</span></p><p><span class="text John-5-9">And that day was the Sabbath. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>The Jews therefore said to him who was cured, &#8220;It is the Sabbath; it is not lawful for you to carry your bed.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>He answered them, &#8220;He who made me well said to me, <span class="woj">&#8216;Take up your bed and walk.&#8217;</span> &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then they asked him, &#8220;Who is the Man who said to you, <span class="woj">&#8216;Take up your bed and walk&#8217;</span>?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>But the one who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, a multitude being in <i>that</i> place. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Afterward Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;See, you have been made well.</span> <span class="woj">Sin no more, lest a worse thing come upon you.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>The man departed and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.</span></p> <h3>
Honor the Father and the Son</span></h3><p><span class="text John-5-16"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>For this reason the Jews persecuted Jesus, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>and sought to kill Him, because He had done these things on the Sabbath. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But Jesus answered them, <span class="woj">&#8220;My Father has been working until now, and I have been working.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill Him, because He not only broke the Sabbath, but also said that God was His Father, making Himself equal with God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then Jesus answered and said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Most assuredly, I say to you,</span> <span class="woj">the Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He sees the Father do; for whatever He does, the Son also does in like manner.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span><span class="woj">For</span> <span class="woj">the Father loves the Son, and</span> <span class="woj">shows Him all things that He Himself does; and He will show Him greater works than these, that you may marvel.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span><span class="woj">For as the Father raises the dead and gives life to <i>them,</i></span> <span class="woj">even so the Son gives life to whom He will.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span><span class="woj">For the Father judges no one, but</span> <span class="woj">has committed all judgment to the Son,</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span><span class="woj">that all should honor the Son just as they honor the Father.</span> <span class="woj">He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him.</span></span></p> <h3>
Life and Judgment Are Through the Son</span></h3><p><span class="text John-5-24"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;Most assuredly, I say to you,</span> <span class="woj">he who hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me has everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment,</span> <span class="woj">but has passed from death into life.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span><span class="woj">Most assuredly, I say to you, the hour is coming, and now is, when</span> <span class="woj">the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God; and those who hear will live.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span><span class="woj">For</span> <span class="woj">as the Father has life in Himself, so He has granted the Son to have</span> <span class="woj">life in Himself,</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span><span class="woj">and</span> <span class="woj">has given Him authority to execute judgment also,</span> <span class="woj">because He is the Son of Man.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span><span class="woj">Do not marvel at this; for the hour is coming in which all who are in the graves will</span> <span class="woj">hear His voice</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span><span class="woj">and come forth&#8212;</span><span class="woj">those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of condemnation.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span><span class="woj">I can of Myself do nothing. As I hear, I judge; and My judgment is righteous, because</span> <span class="woj">I do not seek My own will but the will of the Father who sent Me.</span></span></p> <h3>
The Fourfold Witness</span></h3><p><span class="text John-5-31"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;If I bear witness of Myself, My witness is not</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span><span class="woj">true.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span><span class="woj">There is another who bears witness of Me, and I know that the witness which He witnesses of Me is true.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span><span class="woj">You have sent to John,</span> <span class="woj">and he has borne witness to the truth.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span><span class="woj">Yet I do not receive testimony from man, but I say these things that you may be saved.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span><span class="woj">He was the burning and</span> <span class="woj">shining lamp, and</span> <span class="woj">you were willing for a time to rejoice in his light.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span><span class="woj">But</span> <span class="woj">I have a greater witness than John&#8217;s; for</span> <span class="woj">the works which the Father has given Me to finish&#8212;the very</span> <span class="woj">works that I do&#8212;bear witness of Me, that the Father has sent Me.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span><span class="woj">And the Father Himself, who sent Me,</span> <span class="woj">has testified of Me. You have neither heard His voice at any time,</span> <span class="woj">nor seen His form.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span><span class="woj">But you do not have His word abiding in you, because whom He sent, Him you do not believe.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span><span class="woj">You search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life; and</span> <span class="woj">these are they which testify of Me.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span><span class="woj">But you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life.</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;I do not receive honor from men.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span><span class="woj">But I know you, that you do not have the love of God in you.</span> </span>
