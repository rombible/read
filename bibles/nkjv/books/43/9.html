<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And His disciples asked Him, saying, &#8220;Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Jesus answered, <span class="woj">&#8220;Neither this man nor his parents sinned,</span> <span class="woj">but that the works of God should be revealed in him.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span><span class="woj">I</span><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span> <span class="woj">must work the works of Him who sent Me while it is</span> <span class="woj">day; <i>the</i> night is coming when no one can work.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span><span class="woj">As long as I am in the world,</span> <span class="woj">I am the light of the world.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>When He had said these things, He spat on the ground and made clay with the saliva; and He anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And He said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;Go, wash</span> <span class="woj">in the pool of Siloam&#8221;</span> (which is translated, Sent). So he went and washed, and came back seeing.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Therefore the neighbors and those who previously had seen that he was <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>blind said, &#8220;Is not this he who sat and begged?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Some said, &#8220;This is he.&#8221; Others <i>said,</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>&#8220;He is like him.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text John-9-9">He said, &#8220;I am <i>he.</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Therefore they said to him, &#8220;How were your eyes opened?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>He answered and said, &#8220;A Man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes and said to me, <span class="woj">&#8216;Go to</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span><span class="woj">the pool of Siloam and wash.&#8217;</span> So I went and washed, and I received sight.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then they said to him, &#8220;Where is He?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text John-9-12">He said, &#8220;I do not know.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
The Pharisees Excommunicate the Healed Man</span></h3><p><span class="text John-9-13"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>They brought him who formerly was blind to the Pharisees. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Now it was a Sabbath when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then the Pharisees also asked him again how he had received his sight. He said to them, &#8220;He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Therefore some of the Pharisees said, &#8220;This Man is not from God, because He does not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>keep the Sabbath.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text John-9-16">Others said, &#8220;How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?&#8221; And there was a division among them.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>They said to the blind man again, &#8220;What do you say about Him because He opened your eyes?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text John-9-17">He said, &#8220;He is a prophet.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind and received his sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And they asked them, saying, &#8220;Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>His parents answered them and said, &#8220;We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>but by what means he now sees we do not know, or who opened his eyes we do not know. He is of age; ask him. He will speak for himself.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>His parents said these <i>things</i> because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had agreed already that if anyone confessed <i>that</i> He <i>was</i> Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Therefore his parents said, &#8220;He is of age; ask him.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>So they again called the man who was blind, and said to him, &#8220;Give God the glory! We know that this Man is a sinner.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>He answered and said, &#8220;Whether He is a sinner <i>or not</i> I do not know. One thing I know: that though I was blind, now I see.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Then they said to him again, &#8220;What did He do to you? How did He open your eyes?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>He answered them, &#8220;I told you already, and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear <i>it</i> again? Do you also want to become His disciples?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then they reviled him and said, &#8220;You are His disciple, but we are Moses&#8217; disciples. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>We know that God spoke to Moses; <i>as for</i> this <i>fellow,</i> we do not know where He is from.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>The man answered and said to them, &#8220;Why, this is a marvelous thing, that you do not know where He is from; yet He has opened my eyes! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Now we know that God does not hear sinners; but if anyone is a worshiper of God and does His will, He hears him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Since the world began it has been unheard of that anyone opened the eyes of one who was born blind. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>If this Man were not from God, He could do nothing.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>They answered and said to him, &#8220;You were completely born in sins, and are you teaching us?&#8221; And they <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>cast him out.</span></p> <h3>
True Vision and True Blindness</span></h3><p><span class="text John-9-35"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when He had found him, He said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;Do you</span> <span class="woj">believe in</span> <span class="woj">the Son of</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span><span class="woj">God?&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>He answered and said, &#8220;Who is He, Lord, that I may believe in Him?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>And Jesus said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;You have both seen Him and</span> <span class="woj">it is He who is talking with you.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>Then he said, &#8220;Lord, I believe!&#8221; And he worshiped Him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>And Jesus said, <span class="woj">&#8220;For judgment I have come into this world,</span> <span class="woj">that those who do not see may see, and that those who see may be made blind.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>Then <i>some</i> of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these words, and said to Him, &#8220;Are we blind also?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>Jesus said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now you say, &#8216;We see.&#8217; Therefore your sin remains.</span></span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-26445a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to John 9:4">John 9:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>We</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-26449b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to John 9:8">John 9:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>a beggar</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-26450c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to John 9:9">John 9:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>&#8220;No, but he is like him.&#8221;</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-26452d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to John 9:11">John 9:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>the pool of</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-26457e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to John 9:16">John 9:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>observe</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-26475f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to John 9:34">John 9:34</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Excommunicated him</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-26476g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to John 9:35">John 9:35</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>Man</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
