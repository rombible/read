<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span><span class="woj">They will put you out of the synagogues; yes, the time is coming</span> <span class="woj">that whoever kills you will think that he offers God service.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span><span class="woj">And</span> <span class="woj">these things they will do</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span><span class="woj">to you because they have not known the Father nor Me.</span> </span>

The Work of the Holy Spirit</span></h3><p><span class="text John-16-5"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;But now I</span> <span class="woj">go away to Him who sent Me, and none of you asks Me, &#8216;Where are You going?&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span><span class="woj">But because I have said these things to you,</span> <span class="woj">sorrow has filled your heart.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span><span class="woj">Nevertheless I tell you the truth. It is to your advantage that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; but</span> <span class="woj">if I depart, I will send Him to you.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><span class="woj">And when He has</span> <span class="woj">come, He will convict the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span><span class="woj">of sin, because they do not believe in Me;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><span class="woj">of righteousness,</span> <span class="woj">because I go to My Father and you see Me no more;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span><span class="woj">of judgment, because</span> <span class="woj">the ruler of this world is judged.</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;I still have many things to say to you,</span> <span class="woj">but you cannot bear <i>them</i> now.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span><span class="woj">However, when He,</span> <span class="woj">the Spirit of truth, has come,</span> <span class="woj">He will guide you into all truth; for He will not speak on His own <i>authority,</i> but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will tell you things to come.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span><span class="woj">He will glorify Me, for He will take of what is Mine and declare <i>it</i> to you.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span><span class="woj">All things that the Father has are Mine.

Sorrow Will Turn to Joy</span></h3><p><span class="text John-16-16"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;A</span> <span class="woj">little while, and you will not see Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me,</span> <span class="woj">because I go to the Father.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then <i>some</i> of His disciples said among themselves, &#8220;What is this that He says to us, <span class="woj">&#8216;A little while, and you will not see Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me&#8217;</span>; and, <span class="woj">&#8216;because I go to the Father&#8217;</span>?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>They said therefore, &#8220;What is this that He says, <span class="woj">&#8216;A little while&#8217;</span>? We do not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>know what He is saying.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Now Jesus knew that they desired to ask Him, and He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Are you inquiring among yourselves about what I said, &#8216;A little while, and you will not see Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me&#8217;?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span><span class="woj">Most assuredly, I say to you that you will weep and</span> <span class="woj">lament, but the world will rejoice; and you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into</span> <span class="woj">joy.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span><span class="woj">A woman, when she is in labor, has sorrow because her hour has come; but as soon as she has given birth to the child, she no longer remembers the anguish, for joy that a human being has been born into the world.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span><span class="woj">Therefore you now have sorrow; but I will see you again and</span> <span class="woj">your heart will rejoice, and your joy no one will take from you.</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;And in that day you will ask Me nothing.</span> <span class="woj">Most assuredly, I say to you, whatever you ask the Father in My name He will give you.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span><span class="woj">Until now you have asked nothing in My name. Ask, and you will receive,</span> <span class="woj">that your joy may be</span> <span class="woj">full.</span></span></p> <h3>
Jesus Christ Has Overcome the World</span></h3><p><span class="text John-16-25"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;These things I have spoken to you in figurative language; but the time is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figurative language, but I will tell you</span> <span class="woj">plainly about the Father.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span><span class="woj">In that day you will ask in My name, and I do not say to you that I shall pray the Father for you;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span><span class="woj">for the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved Me, and</span> <span class="woj">have believed that I came forth from God.</span> </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>His disciples said to Him, &#8220;See, now You are speaking plainly, and using no figure of speech! </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Jesus answered them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Do you now believe?</span> </span>
