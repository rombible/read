<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>It was <i>that</i> Mary who anointed the Lord with fragrant oil and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Therefore the sisters sent to Him, saying, &#8220;Lord, behold, he whom You love is sick.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>When Jesus heard <i>that,</i> He said, <span class="woj">&#8220;This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified through it.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So, when He heard that he was sick, He stayed two more days in the place where He was. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then after this He said to <i>the</i> disciples, <span class="woj">&#8220;Let us go to Judea again.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><i>The</i> disciples said to Him, &#8220;Rabbi, lately the Jews sought to stone You, and are You going there again?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Jesus answered, <span class="woj">&#8220;Are there not twelve hours in the day?</span> <span class="woj">If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the</span> <span class="woj">light of this world.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><span class="woj">But</span> <span class="woj">if one walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>These things He said, and after that He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Our friend Lazarus</span> <span class="woj">sleeps, but I go that I may wake him up.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then His disciples said, &#8220;Lord, if he sleeps he will get well.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>However, Jesus spoke of his death, but they thought that He was speaking about taking rest in sleep.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then Jesus said to them plainly, <span class="woj">&#8220;Lazarus is dead.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span><span class="woj">And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, that you may believe. Nevertheless let us go to him.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then Thomas, who is called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, &#8220;Let us also go, that we may die with Him.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
I Am the Resurrection and the Life</span></h3><p><span class="text John-11-17"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So when Jesus came, He found that he had already been in the tomb four days. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>two miles away. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And many of the Jews had joined the women around Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met Him, but Mary was sitting in the house. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Now Martha said to Jesus, &#8220;Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But even now I know that whatever You ask of God, God will give You.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Jesus said to her, <span class="woj">&#8220;Your brother will rise again.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Martha said to Him, &#8220;I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Jesus said to her, <span class="woj">&#8220;I am</span> <span class="woj">the resurrection and the life.</span> <span class="woj">He who believes in Me, though he may</span> <span class="woj">die, he shall live.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span><span class="woj">And whoever lives and believes in Me shall never die. Do you believe this?&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>She said to Him, &#8220;Yes, Lord, I believe that You are the Christ, the Son of God, who is to come into the world.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Jesus and Death, the Last Enemy</span></h3><p><span class="text John-11-28"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And when she had said these things, she went her way and secretly called Mary her sister, saying, &#8220;The Teacher has come and is calling for you.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>As soon as she heard <i>that,</i> she arose quickly and came to Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Now Jesus had not yet come into the town, but <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>was in the place where Martha met Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Then the Jews who were with her in the house, and comforting her, when they saw that Mary rose up quickly and went out, followed her, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>saying, &#8220;She is going to the tomb to weep there.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Then, when Mary came where Jesus was, and saw Him, she fell down at His feet, saying to Him, &#8220;Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Therefore, when Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her weeping, He groaned in the spirit and was troubled. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>And He said, <span class="woj">&#8220;Where have you laid him?&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span class="text John-11-34">They said to Him, &#8220;Lord, come and see.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Jesus wept. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Then the Jews said, &#8220;See how He loved him!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>And some of them said, &#8220;Could not this Man, who opened the eyes of the blind, also have kept this man from dying?&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Lazarus Raised from the Dead</span></h3><p><span class="text John-11-38"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>Then Jesus, again groaning in Himself, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay against it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>Jesus said, <span class="woj">&#8220;Take away the stone.&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span class="text John-11-39">Martha, the sister of him who was dead, said to Him, &#8220;Lord, by this time there is a stench, for he has been <i>dead</i> four days.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>Jesus said to her, <span class="woj">&#8220;Did I not say to you that if you would believe you would</span> <span class="woj">see the glory of God?&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>Then they took away the stone <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span><i>from the place</i> where the dead man was lying. And Jesus lifted up <i>His</i> eyes and said, <span class="woj">&#8220;Father, I thank You that You have heard Me.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span><span class="woj">And I know that You always hear Me, but</span> <span class="woj">because of the people who are standing by I said <i>this,</i> that they may believe that You sent Me.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>Now when He had said these things, He cried with a loud voice, <span class="woj">&#8220;Lazarus, come forth!&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>And he who had died came out bound hand and foot with graveclothes, and his face was wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Loose him, and let him go.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
The Plot to Kill Jesus</span></h3><p><span class="text John-11-45"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>Then many of the Jews who had come to Mary, and had seen the things Jesus did, believed in Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span>But some of them went away to the Pharisees and told them the things Jesus did. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-47.htm"><b>47</b></a></span>Then the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered a council and said, &#8220;What shall we do? For this Man works many signs. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-48.htm"><b>48</b></a></span>If we let Him alone like this, everyone will believe in Him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and nation.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-49.htm"><b>49</b></a></span>And one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them, &#8220;You know nothing at all, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-50.htm"><b>50</b></a></span>nor do you consider that it is expedient for <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>us that one man should die for the people, and not that the whole nation should perish.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-51.htm"><b>51</b></a></span>Now this he did not say on his own <i>authority;</i> but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-52.htm"><b>52</b></a></span>and not for that nation only, but also that He would gather together in one the children of God who were scattered abroad.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-53.htm"><b>53</b></a></span>Then, from that day on, they plotted to put Him to death. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-54.htm"><b>54</b></a></span>Therefore Jesus no longer walked openly among the Jews, but went from there into the country near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim, and there remained with His disciples.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-55.htm"><b>55</b></a></span>And the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went from the country up to Jerusalem before the Passover, to purify themselves. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-56.htm"><b>56</b></a></span>Then they sought Jesus, and spoke among themselves as they stood in the temple, &#8220;What do you think&#8212;that He will not come to the feast?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-57.htm"><b>57</b></a></span>Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a command, that if anyone knew where He was, he should report <i>it,</i> that they might seize Him.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-26542a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to John 11:18">John 11:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>15 stadia</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-26554b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to John 11:30">John 11:30</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>was still</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-26555c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to John 11:31">John 11:31</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>supposing that she was going</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-26565d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to John 11:41">John 11:41</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>from the place where the dead man was lying</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-26574e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to John 11:50">John 11:50</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>you</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
