<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Judas, who betrayed Him, also knew the place; for Jesus often met there with His disciples. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then Judas, having received a detachment <i>of troops,</i> and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Jesus therefore, knowing all things that would come upon Him, went forward and said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Whom are you seeking?&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>They answered Him, &#8220;Jesus <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>of Nazareth.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text John-18-5">Jesus said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;I am <i>He.</i>&#8221;</span> And Judas, who betrayed Him, also stood with them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now when He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;I am <i>He,</i>&#8221;</span> they drew back and fell to the ground.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then He asked them again, <span class="woj">&#8220;Whom are you seeking?&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span class="text John-18-7">And they said, &#8220;Jesus of Nazareth.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Jesus answered, <span class="woj">&#8220;I have told you that I am <i>He.</i> Therefore, if you seek Me, let these go their way,&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>that the saying might be fulfilled which He spoke, <span class="woj">&#8220;Of those whom You gave Me I have lost none.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest&#8217;s servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant&#8217;s name was Malchus.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So Jesus said to Peter, <span class="woj">&#8220;Put your sword into the sheath. Shall I not drink</span> <span class="woj">the cup which My Father has given Me?&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Before the High Priest</span></h3><p><span class="text John-18-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then the detachment <i>of troops</i> and the captain and the officers of the Jews arrested Jesus and bound Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And they led Him away to Annas first, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas who was high priest that year. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Now it was Caiaphas who advised the Jews that it was <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>expedient that one man should die for the people.</span></p> <h3>
Peter Denies Jesus</span></h3><p><span class="text John-18-15"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so <i>did</i> another<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> disciple. Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and went with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But Peter stood at the door outside. Then the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to her who kept the door, and brought Peter in. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then the servant girl who kept the door said to Peter, &#8220;You are not also <i>one</i> of this Man&#8217;s disciples, are you?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text John-18-17">He said, &#8220;I am not.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Now the servants and officers who had made a fire of coals stood there, for it was cold, and they warmed themselves. And Peter stood with them and warmed himself.</span></p> <h3>
Jesus Questioned by the High Priest</span></h3><p><span class="text John-18-19"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>The high priest then asked Jesus about His disciples and His doctrine.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Jesus answered him, <span class="woj">&#8220;I spoke openly to the world. I always taught</span> <span class="woj">in synagogues and</span> <span class="woj">in the temple, where</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span><span class="woj">the Jews always meet, and in secret I have said nothing.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span><span class="woj">Why do you ask Me? Ask</span> <span class="woj">those who have heard Me what I said to them. Indeed they know what I said.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And when He had said these things, one of the officers who stood by struck<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span> Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, &#8220;Do You answer the high priest like that?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Jesus answered him, <span class="woj">&#8220;If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil; but if well, why do you strike Me?&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then Annas sent Him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.</span></p> <h3>
Peter Denies Twice More</span></h3><p><span class="text John-18-25"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Now Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. Therefore they said to him, &#8220;You are not also <i>one</i> of His disciples, are you?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text John-18-25">He denied <i>it</i> and said, &#8220;I am not!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>One of the servants of the high priest, a relative <i>of him</i> whose ear Peter cut off, said, &#8220;Did I not see you in the garden with Him?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Peter then denied again; and immediately a rooster crowed.</span></p> <h3>
In Pilate&#8217;s Court</span></h3><p><span class="text John-18-28"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the Praetorium, and it was early morning. But they themselves did not go into the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>Praetorium, lest they should be defiled, but that they might eat the Passover. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Pilate then went out to them and said, &#8220;What accusation do you bring against this Man?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>They answered and said to him, &#8220;If He were not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>an evildoer, we would not have delivered Him up to you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Then Pilate said to them, &#8220;You take Him and judge Him according to your law.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text John-18-31">Therefore the Jews said to him, &#8220;It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death,&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>that the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled which He spoke, signifying by what death He would die.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Then Pilate entered the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>Praetorium again, called Jesus, and said to Him, &#8220;Are You the King of the Jews?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Jesus answered him, <span class="woj">&#8220;Are you speaking for yourself about this, or did others tell you this concerning Me?&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Pilate answered, &#8220;Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered You to me. What have You done?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Jesus answered, <span class="woj">&#8220;My kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, My servants would fight, so that I should not be delivered to the Jews; but now My kingdom is not from here.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>Pilate therefore said to Him, &#8220;Are You a king then?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text John-18-37">Jesus answered, <span class="woj">&#8220;You say <i>rightly</i> that I am a king. For this cause I was born, and for this cause I have come into the world,</span> <span class="woj">that I should bear</span> <span class="woj">witness to the truth. Everyone who</span> <span class="woj">is of the truth</span> <span class="woj">hears My voice.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>Pilate said to Him, &#8220;What is truth?&#8221; And when he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and said to them, &#8220;I find no fault in Him at all.</span></p> <h3>
Taking the Place of Barabbas</span></h3><p><span class="text John-18-39"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>&#8220;But you have a custom that I should release someone to you at the Passover. Do you therefore want me to release to you the King of the Jews?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>Then they all cried again, saying, &#8220;Not this Man, but Barabbas!&#8221; Now Barabbas was a robber.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-26791a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to John 18:5">John 18:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>the Nazarene</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-26800b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to John 18:14">John 18:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>advantageous</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-26801c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to John 18:15">John 18:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'>M <i>the other</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-26806d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to John 18:20">John 18:20</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>all the Jews meet</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-26808e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to John 18:22">John 18:22</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>gave Jesus a slap,</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-26814f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to John 18:28">John 18:28</span> <span class='footnote-text'>The governor&#8217;s headquarters</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-26816g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to John 18:30">John 18:30</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>a criminal</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-26819h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to John 18:33">John 18:33</span> <span class='footnote-text'>The governor&#8217;s headquarters</span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
