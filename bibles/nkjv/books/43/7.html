<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Now the Jews&#8217; Feast of Tabernacles was at hand. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>His brothers therefore said to Him, &#8220;Depart from here and go into Judea, that Your disciples also may see the works that You are doing. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For no one does anything in secret while he himself seeks to be known openly. If You do these things, show Yourself to the world.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For even His brothers did not believe in Him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then Jesus said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span><span class="woj">The world cannot hate you, but it hates Me</span> <span class="woj">because I testify of it that its works are evil.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><span class="woj">You go up to this feast. I am not</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span><span class="woj">yet going up to this feast,</span> <span class="woj">for My time has not yet fully come.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>When He had said these things to them, He remained in Galilee.</span></p> <h3>
The Heavenly Scholar</span></h3><p><span class="text John-7-10"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>But when His brothers had gone up, then He also went up to the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then the Jews sought Him at the feast, and said, &#8220;Where is He?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And there was much complaining among the people concerning Him. Some said, &#8220;He is good&#8221;; others said, &#8220;No, on the contrary, He deceives the people.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>However, no one spoke openly of Him for fear of the Jews.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Now about the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and taught. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And the Jews marveled, saying, &#8220;How does this Man know letters, having never studied?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Jesus answered them and said, <span class="woj">&#8220;My doctrine is not Mine, but His who sent Me.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span><span class="woj">If anyone wills to do His will, he shall know concerning the doctrine, whether it is from God or <i>whether</i> I speak on My own <i>authority.</i></span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span><span class="woj">He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory; but He who</span> <span class="woj">seeks the glory of the One who sent Him is true, and</span> <span class="woj">no unrighteousness is in Him.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span><span class="woj">Did not Moses give you the law, yet none of you keeps the law?</span> <span class="woj">Why do you seek to kill Me?&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>The people answered and said, &#8220;You have a demon. Who is seeking to kill You?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Jesus answered and said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;I did one work, and you all marvel.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span><span class="woj">Moses therefore gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses,</span> <span class="woj">but from the fathers), and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span><span class="woj">If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath, so that the law of Moses should not be broken, are you angry with Me because</span> <span class="woj">I made a man completely well on the Sabbath?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span><span class="woj">Do not judge according to appearance, but judge with righteous judgment.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Could This Be the Christ?</span></h3><p><span class="text John-7-25"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Now some of them from Jerusalem said, &#8220;Is this not He whom they seek to kill? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>But look! He speaks boldly, and they say nothing to Him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>truly the Christ? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>However, we know where this Man is from; but when the Christ comes, no one knows where He is from.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then Jesus cried out, as He taught in the temple, saying, <span class="woj">&#8220;You both know Me, and you know where I am from; and</span> <span class="woj">I have not come of Myself, but He who sent Me</span> <span class="woj">is true,</span> <span class="woj">whom you do not know.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span><span class="woj">But</span> <span class="woj">I know Him, for I am from Him, and He sent Me.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Therefore they sought to take Him; but no one laid a hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>And many of the people believed in Him, and said, &#8220;When the Christ comes, will He do more signs than these which this <i>Man</i> has done?&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Jesus and the Religious Leaders</span></h3><p><span class="text John-7-32"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things concerning Him, and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Then Jesus said <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;I shall be with you a little while longer, and <i>then</i> I</span> <span class="woj">go to Him who sent Me.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span><span class="woj">You</span> <span class="woj">will seek Me and not find <i>Me,</i> and where I am you</span> <span class="woj">cannot come.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Then the Jews said among themselves, &#8220;Where does He intend to go that we shall not find Him? Does He intend to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>What is this thing that He said, <span class="woj">&#8216;You will seek Me and not find Me, and where I am you cannot come&#8217;</span>?&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
The Promise of the Holy Spirit</span></h3><p><span class="text John-7-37"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>On the last day, that great <i>day</i> of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, <span class="woj">&#8220;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span><span class="woj">He who believes in Me, as the Scripture has said,</span> <span class="woj">out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>But this He spoke concerning the Spirit, whom those <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>believing in Him would receive; for the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>Holy Spirit was not yet <i>given,</i> because Jesus was not yet glorified.</span></p> <h3>
Who Is He?</span></h3><p><span class="text John-7-40"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>Therefore <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>many from the crowd, when they heard this saying, said, &#8220;Truly this is the Prophet.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>Others said, &#8220;This is the Christ.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text John-7-41">But some said, &#8220;Will the Christ come out of Galilee? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>Has not the Scripture said that the Christ comes from the seed of David and from the town of Bethlehem, where David was?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>So there was a division among the people because of Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>Now some of them wanted to take Him, but no one laid hands on Him.</span></p> <h3>
Rejected by the Authorities</span></h3><p><span class="text John-7-45"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>Then the officers came to the chief priests and Pharisees, who said to them, &#8220;Why have you not brought Him?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span>The officers answered, &#8220;No man ever spoke like this Man!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-47.htm"><b>47</b></a></span>Then the Pharisees answered them, &#8220;Are you also deceived? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-48.htm"><b>48</b></a></span>Have any of the rulers or the Pharisees believed in Him? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-49.htm"><b>49</b></a></span>But this crowd that does not know the law is accursed.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-50.htm"><b>50</b></a></span>Nicodemus (he who came to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>Jesus <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span>by night, being one of them) said to them, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-51.htm"><b>51</b></a></span>&#8220;Does our law judge a man before it hears him and knows what he is doing?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-52.htm"><b>52</b></a></span>They answered and said to him, &#8220;Are you also from Galilee? Search and look, for no prophet <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[l]</a></span>has arisen out of Galilee.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
