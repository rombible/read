<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he spoke before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, &#8220;What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they fortify themselves? Will they offer sacrifices? Will they complete it in a day? Will they revive the stones from the heaps of rubbish&#8212;<i>stones</i> that are burned?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Now Tobiah the Ammonite <i>was</i> beside him, and he said, &#8220;Whatever they build, if even a fox goes up <i>on it,</i> he will break down their stone wall.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Hear, O our God, for we are despised; turn their reproach on their own heads, and give them as plunder to a land of captivity! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Do not cover their iniquity, and do not let their sin be blotted out from before You; for they have provoked <i>You</i> to anger before the builders.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So we built the wall, and the entire wall was joined together up to half its <i>height,</i> for the people had a mind to work.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now it happened, when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the walls of Jerusalem were being restored and the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>gaps were beginning to be closed, that they became very angry, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>and all of them conspired together to come <i>and</i> attack Jerusalem and create confusion. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Nevertheless we made our prayer to our God, and because of them we set a watch against them day and night.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then Judah said, &#8220;The strength of the laborers is failing, and <i>there is</i> so much rubbish that we are not able to build the wall.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And our adversaries said, &#8220;They will neither know nor see anything, till we come into their midst and kill them and cause the work to cease.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So it was, when the Jews who dwelt near them came, that they told us ten times, &#8220;From whatever place you turn, <i>they will be</i> upon us.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Therefore I positioned <i>men</i> behind the lower parts of the wall, at the openings; and I set the people according to their families, with their swords, their spears, and their bows. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And I looked, and arose and said to the nobles, to the leaders, and to the rest of the people, &#8220;Do not be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, great and awesome, and fight for your brethren, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your houses.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And it happened, when our enemies heard that it was known to us, and <i>that</i> God had brought their plot to nothing, that all of us returned to the wall, everyone to his work. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So it was, from that time on, <i>that</i> half of my servants worked at construction, while the other half held the spears, the shields, the bows, and <i>wore</i> armor; and the leaders <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span><i>were</i> behind all the house of Judah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Those who built on the wall, and those who carried burdens, loaded themselves so that with one hand they worked at construction, and with the other held a weapon. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Every one of the builders had his sword girded at his side as he built. And the one who sounded the trumpet <i>was</i> beside me.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then I said to the nobles, the rulers, and the rest of the people, &#8220;The work <i>is</i> great and extensive, and we are separated far from one another on the wall. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, rally to us there. Our God will fight for us.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>So we labored in the work, and half of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span><i>the men</i> held the spears from daybreak until the stars appeared. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>At the same time I also said to the people, &#8220;Let each man and his servant stay at night in Jerusalem, that they may be our guard by night and a working party by day.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>So neither I, my brethren, my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me took off our clothes, <i>except</i> that everyone took them off for washing.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-12367a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Nehemiah 4:7">Nehemiah 4:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>breaks</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12376b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Nehemiah 4:16">Nehemiah 4:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Supported</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12381c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Nehemiah 4:21">Nehemiah 4:21</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>them</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
