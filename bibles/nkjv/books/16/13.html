<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>because they had not met the children of Israel with bread and water, but hired Balaam against them to curse them. However, our God turned the curse into a blessing. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So it was, when they had heard the Law, that they separated all the mixed multitude from Israel.</span></p> <h3>
The Reforms of Nehemiah</span></h3><p><span class="text Neh-13-4"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Now before this, Eliashib the priest, having authority over the storerooms of the house of our God, <i>was</i> allied with Tobiah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And he had prepared for him a large room, where previously they had stored the grain offerings, the frankincense, the articles, the tithes of grain, the new wine and oil, which were commanded <i>to be given</i> to the Levites and singers and gatekeepers, and the offerings for the priests. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But during all this I was not in Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I had returned to the king. Then after certain days I obtained leave from the king, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and I came to Jerusalem and discovered the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in preparing a room for him in the courts of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>house of God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And it grieved me bitterly; therefore I threw all the household goods of Tobiah out of the room. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then I commanded them to cleanse the rooms; and I brought back into them the articles of the house of God, with the grain offering and the frankincense.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>I also realized that the portions for the Levites had not been given <i>them;</i> for each of the Levites and the singers who did the work had gone back to his field. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So I contended with the rulers, and said, &#8220;Why is the house of God forsaken?&#8221; And I gathered them together and set them in their place. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then all Judah brought the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the oil to the storehouse. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And I appointed as treasurers over the storehouse Shelemiah the priest and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah; and next to them <i>was</i> Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were considered faithful, and their task <i>was</i> to distribute to their brethren.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and do not wipe out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for its services!</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>In those days I saw <i>people</i> in Judah treading winepresses on the Sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and loading donkeys with wine, grapes, figs, and all <i>kinds of</i> burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. And I warned <i>them</i> about the day on which they were selling provisions. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Men of Tyre dwelt there also, who brought in fish and all kinds of goods, and sold <i>them</i> on the Sabbath to the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said to them, &#8220;What evil thing <i>is</i> this that you do, by which you profane the Sabbath day? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Did not your fathers do thus, and did not our God bring all this disaster on us and on this city? Yet you bring added wrath on Israel by profaning the Sabbath.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>So it was, at the gates of Jerusalem, as it began to be dark before the Sabbath, that I commanded the gates to be shut, and charged that they must not be opened till after the Sabbath. Then I posted <i>some</i> of my servants at the gates, <i>so that</i> no burdens would be brought in on the Sabbath day. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Now the merchants and sellers of all kinds of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>wares <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>lodged outside Jerusalem once or twice.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then I warned them, and said to them, &#8220;Why do you spend the night <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>around the wall? If you do <i>so</i> again, I will lay hands on you!&#8221; From that time on they came no <i>more</i> on the Sabbath. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should go and guard the gates, to sanctify the Sabbath day.</span></p><p><span class="text Neh-13-22">Remember me, O my God, <i>concerning</i> this also, and spare me according to the greatness of Your mercy!</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>In those days I also saw Jews <i>who</i> had married women of Ashdod, Ammon, <i>and</i> Moab. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod, and could not speak the language of Judah, but spoke according to the language of one or the other people.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>So I contended with them and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>cursed them, struck some of them and pulled out their hair, and made them swear by God, <i>saying,</i> &#8220;You shall not give your daughters as wives to their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons or yourselves. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? Yet among many nations there was no king like him, who was beloved of his God; and God made him king over all Israel. Nevertheless pagan women caused even him to sin. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Should we then hear of your doing all this great evil, transgressing against our God by marrying pagan women?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And <i>one</i> of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, <i>was</i> a son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite; therefore I drove him from me.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Thus I cleansed them of everything pagan. I also assigned duties to the priests and the Levites, each to his service, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>and <i>to bringing</i> the wood offering and the firstfruits at appointed times.</span></p><p><span class="text Neh-13-31">Remember me, O my God, for good!</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-12679a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Nehemiah 13:7">Nehemiah 13:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Temple</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12692b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Nehemiah 13:20">Nehemiah 13:20</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>merchandise</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12692c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Nehemiah 13:20">Nehemiah 13:20</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>spent the night</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12693d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Nehemiah 13:21">Nehemiah 13:21</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>before</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12697e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Nehemiah 13:25">Nehemiah 13:25</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>pronounced them cursed</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
