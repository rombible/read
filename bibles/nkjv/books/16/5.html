<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>For there were those who said, &#8220;We, our sons, and our daughters <i>are</i> many; therefore let us get grain, that we may eat and live.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>There were also <i>some</i> who said, &#8220;We have mortgaged our lands and vineyards and houses, that we might buy grain because of the famine.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>There were also those who said, &#8220;We have borrowed money for the king&#8217;s tax <i>on</i> our lands and vineyards. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Yet now our flesh <i>is</i> as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children; and indeed we are forcing our sons and our daughters to be slaves, and <i>some</i> of our daughters have been brought into slavery. <i>It is</i> not in our power <i>to redeem them,</i> for other men have our lands and vineyards.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And I became very angry when I heard their outcry and these words. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>After serious thought, I rebuked the nobles and rulers, and said to them, &#8220;Each of you is <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>exacting usury from his brother.&#8221; So I <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>called a great assembly against them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And I said to them, &#8220;According to our ability we have redeemed our Jewish brethren who were sold to the nations. Now indeed, will you even sell your brethren? Or should they be sold to us?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Neh-5-8">Then they were silenced and found nothing <i>to say.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then I said, &#8220;What you are doing <i>is</i> not good. Should you not walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the nations, our enemies? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>I also, <i>with</i> my brethren and my servants, am lending them money and grain. Please, let us stop this <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>usury! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Restore now to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their olive groves, and their houses, also a hundredth of the money and the grain, the new wine and the oil, that you have charged them.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So they said, &#8220;We will restore <i>it,</i> and will require nothing from them; we will do as you say.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Neh-5-12">Then I called the priests, and required an oath from them that they would do according to this promise. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then I shook out <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>the fold of my garment and said, &#8220;So may God shake out each man from his house, and from his property, who does not perform this promise. Even thus may he be shaken out and emptied.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Neh-5-13">And all the assembly said, &#8220;Amen!&#8221; and praised the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. Then the people did according to this promise.</span></p> <h3>
The Generosity of Nehemiah</span></h3><p><span class="text Neh-5-14"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Moreover, from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year until the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes, twelve years, neither I nor my brothers ate the governor&#8217;s provisions. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But the former governors who <i>were</i> before me laid burdens on the people, and took from them bread and wine, besides forty shekels of silver. Yes, even their servants bore rule over the people, but I did not do so, because of the fear of God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Indeed, I also continued the work on this wall, and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>we did not buy any land. All my servants <i>were</i> gathered there for the work.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And at my table <i>were</i> one hundred and fifty Jews and rulers, besides those who came to us from the nations around us. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Now <i>that</i> which was prepared daily <i>was</i> one ox <i>and</i> six choice sheep. Also fowl were prepared for me, and once every ten days an abundance of all kinds of wine. Yet in spite of this I did not demand the governor&#8217;s provisions, because the bondage was heavy on this people.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Remember me, my God, for good, <i>according to</i> all that I have done for this people.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-12390a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Nehemiah 5:7">Nehemiah 5:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>charging interest</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12390b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Nehemiah 5:7">Nehemiah 5:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>held</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12393c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Nehemiah 5:10">Nehemiah 5:10</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>interest</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12396d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Nehemiah 5:13">Nehemiah 5:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>my lap</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12399e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Nehemiah 5:16">Nehemiah 5:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>So with MT; LXX, Syr., Vg. <i>I</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
