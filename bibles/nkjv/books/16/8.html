<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So Ezra the priest brought the Law before the assembly of men and women and all who <i>could</i> hear with understanding on the first day of the seventh month. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then he read from it in the open square that <i>was</i> in front of the Water Gate <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>from morning until midday, before the men and women and those who could understand; and the ears of all the people <i>were attentive</i> to the Book of the Law.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So Ezra the scribe stood on a platform of wood which they had made for the purpose; and beside him, at his right hand, stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Urijah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah; and at his left hand Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hashbadana, Zechariah, <i>and</i> Meshullam. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people, for he was <i>standing</i> above all the people; and when he opened it, all the people stood up. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And Ezra blessed the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, the great God.</span></p><p><span class="text Neh-8-6">Then all the people answered, &#8220;Amen, Amen!&#8221; while lifting up their hands. And they bowed their heads and worshiped the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> with <i>their</i> faces to the ground.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Also Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, helped the people to understand the Law; and the people <i>stood</i> in their place. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So they read distinctly from the book, in the Law of God; and they gave the sense, and helped <i>them</i> to understand the reading.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And Nehemiah, who <i>was</i> the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>governor, Ezra the priest <i>and</i> scribe, and the Levites who taught the people said to all the people, &#8220;This day <i>is</i> holy to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God; do not mourn nor weep.&#8221; For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the Law.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then he said to them, &#8220;Go your way, eat the fat, drink the sweet, and send portions to those for whom nothing is prepared; for <i>this</i> day <i>is</i> holy to our Lord. Do not sorrow, for the joy of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> is your strength.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So the Levites quieted all the people, saying, &#8220;Be still, for the day <i>is</i> holy; do not be grieved.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And all the people went their way to eat and drink, to send portions and rejoice greatly, because they understood the words that were declared to them.</span></p> <h3>
The Feast of Tabernacles</span></h3><p><span class="text Neh-8-13"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Now on the second day the heads of the fathers&#8217; <i>houses</i> of all the people, with the priests and Levites, were gathered to Ezra the scribe, in order to understand the words of the Law. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And they found written in the Law, which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> during the feast of the seventh month, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and that they should announce and proclaim in all their cities and in Jerusalem, saying, &#8220;Go out to the mountain, and bring olive branches, branches of oil trees, myrtle branches, palm branches, and branches of leafy trees, to make booths, as <i>it is</i> written.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then the people went out and brought <i>them</i> and made themselves booths, each one on the roof of his house, or in their courtyards or the courts of the house of God, and in the open square of the Water Gate and in the open square of the Gate of Ephraim. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So the whole assembly of those who had returned from the captivity made <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>booths and sat under the booths; for since the days of Joshua the son of Nun until that day the children of Israel had not done so. And there was very great gladness. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Also day by day, from the first day until the last day, he read from the Book of the Law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day <i>there was</i> a sacred assembly, according to the <i>prescribed</i> manner.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-12497a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Nehemiah 8:3">Nehemiah 8:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>from the light</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12503b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Nehemiah 8:9">Nehemiah 8:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. <i>Tirshatha</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12508c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Nehemiah 8:14">Nehemiah 8:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Temporary shelters</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12511d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Nehemiah 8:17">Nehemiah 8:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Temporary shelters</span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
