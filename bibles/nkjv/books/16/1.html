<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>that Hanani one of my brethren came with men from Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped, who had survived the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And they said to me, &#8220;The survivors who are left from the captivity in the province <i>are</i> there in great distress and reproach. The wall of Jerusalem <i>is</i> also broken down, and its gates are burned with fire.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So it was, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned <i>for many</i> days; I was fasting and praying before the God of heaven.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And I said: &#8220;I pray, <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of heaven, O great and awesome God, <i>You</i> who keep <i>Your</i> covenant and mercy with those who love <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>You and observe <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>Your commandments, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>please let Your ear be attentive and Your eyes open, that You may hear the prayer of Your servant which I pray before You now, day and night, for the children of Israel Your servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel which we have sinned against You. Both my father&#8217;s house and I have sinned. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>We have acted very corruptly against You, and have not kept the commandments, the statutes, nor the ordinances which You commanded Your servant Moses. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Remember, I pray, the word that You commanded Your servant Moses, saying, &#8216;<i>If</i> you <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the nations; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>but <i>if</i> you return to Me, and keep My commandments and do them, though some of you were cast out to the farthest part of the heavens, <i>yet</i> I will gather them from there, and bring them to the place which I have chosen as a dwelling for My name.&#8217; </span>
