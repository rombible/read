<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>that Sanballat and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>Geshem sent to me, saying, &#8220;Come, let us meet together <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>among the villages in the plain of Ono.&#8221; But they thought to do me harm.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So I sent messengers to them, saying, &#8220;I <i>am</i> doing a great work, so that I cannot come down. Why should the work cease while I leave it and go down to you?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But they sent me this message four times, and I answered them in the same manner.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then Sanballat sent his servant to me as before, the fifth time, with an open letter in his hand. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>In it <i>was</i> written:</span></p><div class="left-1 top-1"><p class="first-line-none"><span class="text Neh-6-6">It is reported among the nations, and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>Geshem says, <i>that</i> you and the Jews plan to rebel; therefore, according to these rumors, you are rebuilding the wall, that you may be their king. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And you have also appointed prophets to proclaim concerning you at Jerusalem, saying, &#8220;<i>There is</i> a king in Judah!&#8221; Now these matters will be reported to the king. So come, therefore, and let us consult together.</span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then I sent to him, saying, &#8220;No such things as you say are being done, but you invent them in your own heart.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For they all <i>were trying to</i> make us afraid, saying, &#8220;Their hands will be weakened in the work, and it will not be done.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Neh-6-9">Now therefore, <i>O God,</i> strengthen my hands.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Afterward I came to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, who <i>was</i> a secret informer; and he said, &#8220;Let us meet together in the house of God, within the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>temple, and let us close the doors of the temple, for they are coming to kill you; indeed, at night they will come to kill you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And I said, &#8220;Should such a man as I flee? And who <i>is there</i> such as I who would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then I perceived that God had not sent him at all, but that he pronounced <i>this</i> prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For this reason he <i>was</i> hired, that I should be afraid and act that way and sin, so <i>that</i> they might have <i>cause</i> for an evil report, that they might reproach me.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>My God, remember Tobiah and Sanballat, according to these their works, and the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who would have made me afraid.</span></p> <h3>
The Wall Completed</span></h3><p><span class="text Neh-6-15"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth <i>day</i> of Elul, in fifty-two days. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And it happened, when all our enemies heard <i>of it,</i> and all the nations around us saw <i>these things,</i> that they were very disheartened in their own eyes; for they perceived that this work was done by our God.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Also in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and <i>the letters of</i> Tobiah came to them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>For many in Judah were pledged to him, because he was the son-in-law of Shechaniah the son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Also they reported his good deeds before me, and reported my <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>words to him. Tobiah sent letters to frighten me.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-12403a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Nehemiah 6:1">Nehemiah 6:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>Gashmu</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12404b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Nehemiah 6:2">Nehemiah 6:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>Gashmu</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12404c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Nehemiah 6:2">Nehemiah 6:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>in Kephirim,</i> exact location unknown</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12408d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Nehemiah 6:6">Nehemiah 6:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. <i>Gashmu</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12412e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Nehemiah 6:10">Nehemiah 6:10</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>house</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12421f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Nehemiah 6:19">Nehemiah 6:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>affairs</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
