Now I had never been sad in his presence before. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Therefore the king said to me, &#8220;Why <i>is</i> your face sad, since you <i>are</i> not sick? This <i>is</i> nothing but sorrow of heart.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Neh-2-2">So I became <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>dreadfully afraid, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and said to the king, &#8220;May the king live forever! Why should my face not be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers&#8217; tombs, <i>lies</i> waste, and its gates are burned with fire?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then the king said to me, &#8220;What do you request?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Neh-2-4">So I prayed to the God of heaven. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And I said to the king, &#8220;If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor in your sight, I ask that you send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers&#8217; tombs, that I may rebuild it.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then the king said to me (the queen also sitting beside him), &#8220;How long will your journey be? And when will you return?&#8221; So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Furthermore I said to the king, &#8220;If it pleases the king, let letters be given to me for the governors <i>of the region</i> beyond <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>the River, that they must permit me to pass through till I come to Judah, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king&#8217;s forest, that he must give me timber to make beams for the gates of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>citadel which <i>pertains</i> to the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>temple, for the city wall, and for the house that I will occupy.&#8221; And the king granted <i>them</i> to me according to the good hand of my God upon me.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then I went to the governors <i>in the region</i> beyond the River, and gave them the king&#8217;s letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>official heard <i>of it,</i> they were deeply disturbed that a man had come to seek the well-being of the children of Israel.</span></p> <h3>
Nehemiah Views the Wall of Jerusalem</span></h3><p><span class="text Neh-2-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So I came to Jerusalem and was there three days. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then I arose in the night, I and a few men with me; I told no one what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem; nor was there any animal with me, except the one on which I rode. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And I went out by night through the Valley Gate to the Serpent Well and the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>Refuse Gate, and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>viewed the walls of Jerusalem which were broken down and its gates which were burned with fire. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then I went on to the Fountain Gate and to the King&#8217;s Pool, but <i>there was</i> no room for the animal under me to pass. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So I went up in the night by the valley,<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span> and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>viewed the wall; then I turned back and entered by the Valley Gate, and so returned. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And the officials did not know where I had gone or what I had done; I had not yet told the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the officials, or the others who did the work.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then I said to them, &#8220;You see the distress that we <i>are</i> in, how Jerusalem <i>lies</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span>waste, and its gates are burned with fire. Come and let us build the wall of Jerusalem, that we may no longer be a reproach.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And I told them of the hand of my God which had been good upon me, and also of the king&#8217;s words that he had spoken to me.</span></p><p><span class="text Neh-2-18">So they said, &#8220;Let us rise up and build.&#8221; Then they set<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[l]</a></span> their hands to <i>this</i> good <i>work.</i></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official, and Geshem the Arab heard <i>of it,</i> they laughed at us and despised us, and said, &#8220;What <i>is</i> this thing that you are doing? Will you rebel against the king?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So I answered them, and said to them, &#8220;The God of heaven Himself will prosper us; therefore we His servants will arise and build, but you have no heritage or right or memorial in Jerusalem.&#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-12309a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Nehemiah 2:1">Nehemiah 2:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Artaxerxes Longimanus</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12310b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Nehemiah 2:2">Nehemiah 2:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>very much</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12315c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Nehemiah 2:7">Nehemiah 2:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'>The Euphrates</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12316d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Nehemiah 2:8">Nehemiah 2:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>palace</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12316e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Nehemiah 2:8">Nehemiah 2:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>house</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12318f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Nehemiah 2:10">Nehemiah 2:10</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>servant</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12321g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Nehemiah 2:13">Nehemiah 2:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Dung</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12321h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Nehemiah 2:13">Nehemiah 2:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>examined</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12323i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Nehemiah 2:15">Nehemiah 2:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>torrent valley, wadi</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12323j"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Nehemiah 2:15">Nehemiah 2:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>examined</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12325k"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Nehemiah 2:17">Nehemiah 2:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>desolate</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12326l"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Nehemiah 2:18">Nehemiah 2:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>strengthened</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
