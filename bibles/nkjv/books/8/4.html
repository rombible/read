So Boaz said, &#8220;Come aside, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>friend, sit down here.&#8221; So he came aside and sat down. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, &#8220;Sit down here.&#8221; So they sat down. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then he said to the close relative, &#8220;Naomi, who has come back from the country of Moab, sold the piece of land which <i>belonged</i> to our brother Elimelech. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And I thought to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>inform you, saying, &#8216;Buy <i>it</i> back in the presence of the inhabitants and the elders of my people. If you will redeem <i>it,</i> redeem <i>it;</i> but if <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>you will not redeem <i>it, then</i> tell me, that I may know; for <i>there is</i> no one but you to redeem <i>it,</i> and I <i>am</i> next after you.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Ruth-4-4">And he said, &#8220;I will redeem <i>it.</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then Boaz said, &#8220;On the day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi, you must also buy <i>it</i> from Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>perpetuate the name of the dead through his inheritance.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And the close relative said, &#8220;I cannot redeem <i>it</i> for myself, lest I ruin my own inheritance. You redeem my right of redemption for yourself, for I cannot redeem <i>it.</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now this <i>was the custom</i> in former times in Israel concerning redeeming and exchanging, to confirm anything: one man took off his sandal and gave <i>it</i> to the other, and this <i>was</i> a confirmation in Israel.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Therefore the close relative said to Boaz, &#8220;Buy <i>it</i> for yourself.&#8221; So he took off his sandal. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And Boaz said to the elders and all the people, &#8220;You <i>are</i> witnesses this day that I have bought all that was Elimelech&#8217;s, and all that <i>was</i> Chilion&#8217;s and Mahlon&#8217;s, from the hand of Naomi. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Moreover, Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of Mahlon, I have acquired as my wife, to perpetuate the name of the dead through his inheritance, that the name of the dead may not be cut off from among his brethren and from <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>his position at the gate. You <i>are</i> witnesses this day.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And all the people who <i>were</i> at the gate, and the elders, said, &#8220;<i>We are</i> witnesses. The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> make the woman who is coming to your house like Rachel and Leah, the two who built the house of Israel; and may you prosper in Ephrathah and be famous in Bethlehem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>May your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, because of the offspring which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will give you from this young woman.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Descendants of Boaz and Ruth</span></h3><p><span class="text Ruth-4-13"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife; and when he went in to her, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> gave her conception, and she bore a son. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then the women said to Naomi, &#8220;Blessed <i>be</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, who has not left you this day without a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>close relative; and may his name be famous in Israel! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And may he be to you a restorer of life and a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>nourisher of your old age; for your daughter-in-law, who loves you, who is better to you than seven sons, has borne him.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then Naomi took the child and laid him on her bosom, and became a nurse to him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Also the neighbor women gave him a name, saying, &#8220;There is a son born to Naomi.&#8221; And they called his name Obed. He <i>is</i> the father of Jesse, the father of David.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Now this <i>is</i> the genealogy of Perez: Perez begot Hezron; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Hezron begot Ram, and Ram begot Amminadab; </span>
