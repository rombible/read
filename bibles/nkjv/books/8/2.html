His name <i>was</i> Boaz. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, &#8220;Please let me go to the field, and glean heads of grain after <i>him</i> in whose sight I may find favor.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Ruth-2-2">And she said to her, &#8220;Go, my daughter.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then she left, and went and gleaned in the field after the reapers. And she happened to come to the part of the field <i>belonging</i> to Boaz, who <i>was</i> of the family of Elimelech.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Now behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers, &#8220;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>be</i> with you!&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Ruth-2-4">And they answered him, &#8220;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> bless you!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then Boaz said to his servant who was in charge of the reapers, &#8220;Whose young woman <i>is</i> this?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So the servant who was in charge of the reapers answered and said, &#8220;It <i>is</i> the young Moabite woman who came back with Naomi from the country of Moab. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And she said, &#8216;Please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves.&#8217; So she came and has continued from morning until now, though she rested a little in the house.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then Boaz said to Ruth, &#8220;You will listen, my daughter, will you not? Do not go to glean in another field, nor go from here, but stay close by my young women. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span><i>Let</i> your eyes <i>be</i> on the field which they reap, and go after them. Have I not commanded the young men not to touch you? And when you are thirsty, go to the vessels and drink from what the young men have drawn.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So she fell on her face, bowed down to the ground, and said to him, &#8220;Why have I found favor in your eyes, that you should take notice of me, since I <i>am</i> a foreigner?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And Boaz answered and said to her, &#8220;It has been fully reported to me, all that you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband, and <i>how</i> you have left your father and your mother and the land of your birth, and have come to a people whom you did not know before. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> repay your work, and a full reward be given you by the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel, under whose wings you have come for refuge.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then she said, &#8220;Let me find favor in your sight, my lord; for you have comforted me, and have spoken <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>kindly to your maidservant, though I am not like one of your maidservants.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Now Boaz said to her at mealtime, &#8220;Come here, and eat of the bread, and dip your piece of bread in the vinegar.&#8221; So she sat beside the reapers, and he passed parched <i>grain</i> to her; and she ate and was satisfied, and kept some back. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And when she rose up to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, &#8220;Let her glean even among the sheaves, and do not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>reproach her. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Also let <i>grain</i> from the bundles fall purposely for her; leave <i>it</i> that she may glean, and do not rebuke her.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So she gleaned in the field until evening, and beat out what she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then she took <i>it</i> up and went into the city, and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned. So she brought out and gave to her what she had kept back after she had been satisfied.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And her mother-in-law said to her, &#8220;Where have you gleaned today? And where did you work? Blessed be the one who took notice of you.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Ruth-2-19">So she told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, and said, &#8220;The man&#8217;s name with whom I worked today <i>is</i> Boaz.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, &#8220;Blessed <i>be</i> he of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, who has not forsaken His kindness to the living and the dead!&#8221; And Naomi said to her, &#8220;This man <i>is</i> a relation of ours, one of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>our close relatives.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Ruth the Moabitess said, &#8220;He also said to me, &#8216;You shall stay close by my young men until they have finished all my harvest.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, &#8220;<i>It is</i> good, my daughter, that you go out with his young women, and that people do not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>meet you in any other field.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>So she stayed close by the young women of Boaz, to glean until the end of barley harvest and wheat harvest; and she dwelt with her mother-in-law.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-7163a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ruth 2:13">Ruth 2:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>to the heart of</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7165b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ruth 2:15">Ruth 2:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Gather after the reapers</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7165c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ruth 2:15">Ruth 2:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>rebuke</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7170d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ruth 2:20">Ruth 2:20</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>our redeemers,</i> Heb. <i>goalenu</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7172e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ruth 2:22">Ruth 2:22</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>encounter</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
