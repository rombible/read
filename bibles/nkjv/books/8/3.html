<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Now Boaz, whose young women you were with, <i>is he</i> not our relative? In fact, he is winnowing barley tonight at the threshing floor. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Therefore wash yourself and anoint yourself, put on your <i>best</i> garment and go down to the threshing floor; <i>but</i> do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then it shall be, when he lies down, that you shall notice the place where he lies; and you shall go in, uncover his feet, and lie down; and he will tell you what you should do.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And she said to her, &#8220;All that you say to me I will do.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So she went down to the threshing floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law instructed her. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And after Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was cheerful, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain; and she came softly, uncovered his feet, and lay down.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Now it happened at midnight that the man was startled, and turned himself; and there, a woman was lying at his feet. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;Who <i>are</i> you?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Ruth-3-9">So she answered, &#8220;I <i>am</i> Ruth, your maidservant. Take<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span> your maidservant under your wing, for you are a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>close relative.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then he said, &#8220;Blessed <i>are</i> you of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, my daughter! For you have shown more kindness at the end than at the beginning, in that you did not go after young men, whether poor or rich. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And now, my daughter, do not fear. I will do for you all that you request, for all the people of my town know that you <i>are</i> a virtuous woman. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now it is true that I <i>am</i> a close relative; however, there is a relative closer than I. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Stay this night, and in the morning it shall be <i>that</i> if he will perform the duty of a close relative for you&#8212;good; let him do it. But if he does not want to perform the duty for you, then I will perform the duty for you, <i>as</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> lives! Lie down until morning.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So she lay at his feet until morning, and she arose before one could recognize another. Then he said, &#8220;Do not let it be known that the woman came to the threshing floor.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Also he said, &#8220;Bring the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>shawl that <i>is</i> on you and hold it.&#8221; And when she held it, he measured six <i>ephahs</i> of barley, and laid <i>it</i> on her. Then <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>she went into the city.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/3-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>When she came to her mother-in-law, she said, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>&#8220;<i>Is</i> that you, my daughter?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Ruth-3-16">Then she told her all that the man had done for her. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And she said, &#8220;These six <i>ephahs</i> of barley he gave me; for he said to me, &#8216;Do not go empty-handed to your mother-in-law.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/3-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then she said, &#8220;Sit still, my daughter, until you know how the matter will turn out; for the man will not rest until he has concluded the matter this day.&#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-7174a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ruth 3:1">Ruth 3:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>rest</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7182b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ruth 3:9">Ruth 3:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>Spread the corner of your garment over your maidservant</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7182c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ruth 3:9">Ruth 3:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>redeemer,</i> Heb. <i>goel</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7188d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ruth 3:15">Ruth 3:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>cloak</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7188e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ruth 3:15">Ruth 3:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Many Heb. mss., Syr., Vg. <i>she;</i> MT, LXX, Tg. <i>he</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7189f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ruth 3:16">Ruth 3:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>How are you,</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
