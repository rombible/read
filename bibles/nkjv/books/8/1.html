And a certain man of Bethlehem, Judah, went to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>dwell in the country of Moab, he and his wife and his two sons. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>The name of the man <i>was</i> Elimelech, the name of his wife <i>was</i> Naomi, and the names of his two sons <i>were</i> Mahlon and Chilion&#8212;Ephrathites of Bethlehem, Judah. And they went to the country of Moab and remained there. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then Elimelech, Naomi&#8217;s husband, died; and she was left, and her two sons. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Now they took wives of the women of Moab: the name of the one <i>was</i> Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth. And they <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>dwelt there about ten years. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then both Mahlon and Chilion also died; so the woman survived her two sons and her husband.</span></p> <h3>
Naomi Returns with Ruth</span></h3><p><span class="text Ruth-1-6"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then she arose with her daughters-in-law that she might return from the country of Moab, for she had heard in the country of Moab that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had visited<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span> His people by giving them bread. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Therefore she went out from the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, &#8220;Go, return each to her mother&#8217;s house. The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> deal kindly with you, as you have dealt with the dead and with me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> grant that you may find rest, each in the house of her husband.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Ruth-1-9">So she kissed them, and they lifted up their voices and wept. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And they said to her, &#8220;Surely we will return with you to your people.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But Naomi said, &#8220;Turn back, my daughters; why will you go with me? <i>Are</i> there still sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Turn back, my daughters, go&#8212;for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say I have hope, <i>if</i> I should have a husband tonight and should also bear sons, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>would you wait for them till they were grown? Would you restrain yourselves from having husbands? No, my daughters; for it grieves me very much for your sakes that the hand of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has gone out against me!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then they lifted up their voices and wept again; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And she said, &#8220;Look, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods; return after your sister-in-law.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But Ruth said:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Ruth-1-16">&#8220;Entreat<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span> me not to leave you,</span><br /><span class="text Ruth-1-16"><i>Or to</i> turn back from following after you;</span><br /><span class="text Ruth-1-16">For wherever you go, I will go;</span><br /><span class="text Ruth-1-16">And wherever you lodge, I will lodge;</span><br /><span class="text Ruth-1-16">Your people <i>shall be</i> my people,</span><br /><span class="text Ruth-1-16">And your God, my God.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Where you die, I will die,</span><br /><span class="text Ruth-1-17">And there will I be buried.</span><br /><span class="text Ruth-1-17">The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> do so to me, and more also,</span><br /><span class="text Ruth-1-17">If <i>anything but</i> death parts you and me.&#8221;</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>When she saw that she <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>was determined to go with her, she stopped speaking to her.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Now the two of them went until they came to Bethlehem. And it happened, when they had come to Bethlehem, that all the city was excited because of them; and the women said, &#8220;<i>Is</i> this Naomi?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>But she said to them, &#8220;Do not call me <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>Naomi; call me <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>Mara, for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>I went out full, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has brought me home again empty. Why do you call me Naomi, since the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has testified against me, and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>the Almighty has afflicted me?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess her daughter-in-law with her, who returned from the country of Moab. Now they came to Bethlehem at the beginning of barley harvest.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-7129a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ruth 1:1">Ruth 1:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>judged</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7129b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ruth 1:1">Ruth 1:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>As a resident alien</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7132c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ruth 1:4">Ruth 1:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>lived</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7134d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ruth 1:6">Ruth 1:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>attended to</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7144e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ruth 1:16">Ruth 1:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Urge me not</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7146f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ruth 1:18">Ruth 1:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>made herself strong to go</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7148g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ruth 1:20">Ruth 1:20</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Pleasant</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7148h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ruth 1:20">Ruth 1:20</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Bitter</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7149i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ruth 1:21">Ruth 1:21</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. <i>Shaddai</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
