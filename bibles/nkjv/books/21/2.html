<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>I said of laughter&#8212;&#8220;Madness!&#8221;; and of mirth, &#8220;What does it accomplish?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>I searched in my heart <i>how</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>to gratify my flesh with wine, while guiding my heart with wisdom, and how to lay hold on folly, till I might see what <i>was</i> good for the sons of men to do under heaven all the days of their lives.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>I made my works great, I built myself houses, and planted myself vineyards. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>I made myself gardens and orchards, and I planted all <i>kinds</i> of fruit trees in them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>I made myself water pools from which to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>water the growing trees of the grove. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>I acquired male and female servants, and had <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>servants born in my house. Yes, I had greater possessions of herds and flocks than all who were in Jerusalem before me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>I also gathered for myself silver and gold and the special treasures of kings and of the provinces. I acquired male and female singers, the delights of the sons of men, <i>and</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>musical instruments of all kinds.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So I became great and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>excelled more than all who were before me in Jerusalem. Also my wisdom remained with me.</span></p> <div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them.</span><br /><span class="text Eccl-2-10">I did not withhold my heart from any pleasure,</span><br /><span class="text Eccl-2-10">For my heart rejoiced in all my labor;</span><br /><span class="text Eccl-2-10">And this was my <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>reward from all my labor.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then I looked on all the works that my hands had done</span><br /><span class="text Eccl-2-11">And on the labor in which I had toiled;</span><br /><span class="text Eccl-2-11">And indeed all <i>was</i> vanity and grasping for the wind.</span><br /><span class="text Eccl-2-11"><i>There was</i> no profit under the sun.</span></p></div> <h3>
The End of the Wise and the Fool</span></h3><div class="poetry"><p class="line"><span class="text Eccl-2-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then I turned myself to consider wisdom and madness and folly;</span><br /><span class="text Eccl-2-12">For what <i>can</i> the man <i>do</i> who succeeds the king?&#8212;</span><br /><span class="text Eccl-2-12"><i>Only</i> what he has already done.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then I saw that wisdom excels folly</span><br /><span class="text Eccl-2-13">As light excels darkness.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>The wise man&#8217;s eyes <i>are</i> in his head,</span><br /><span class="text Eccl-2-14">But the fool walks in darkness.</span><br /><span class="text Eccl-2-14">Yet I myself perceived</span><br /><span class="text Eccl-2-14">That the same event happens to them all.</span></p></div> <div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So I said in my heart,</span><br /><span class="text Eccl-2-15">&#8220;As it happens to the fool,</span><br /><span class="text Eccl-2-15">It also happens to me,</span><br /><span class="text Eccl-2-15">And why was I then more wise?&#8221;</span><br /><span class="text Eccl-2-15">Then I said in my heart,</span><br /><span class="text Eccl-2-15">&#8220;This also <i>is</i> vanity.&#8221;</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>For <i>there is</i> no more remembrance of the wise than of the fool forever,</span><br /><span class="text Eccl-2-16">Since all that now <i>is</i> will be forgotten in the days to come.</span><br /><span class="text Eccl-2-16">And how does a wise <i>man</i> die?</span><br /><span class="text Eccl-2-16">As the fool!</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Therefore I hated life because the work that was done under the sun <i>was</i> distressing to me, for all <i>is</i> vanity and grasping for the wind.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then I hated all my labor in which I had toiled under the sun, because I must leave it to the man who will come after me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And who knows whether he will be wise or a fool? Yet he will rule over all my labor in which I toiled and in which I have shown myself wise under the sun. This also <i>is</i> vanity. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Therefore I turned my heart and despaired of all the labor in which I had toiled under the sun. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>For there is a man whose labor <i>is</i> with wisdom, knowledge, and skill; yet he must leave his <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>heritage to a man who has not labored for it. This also <i>is</i> vanity and a great evil. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>For what has man for all his labor, and for the striving of his heart with which he has toiled under the sun? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>For all his days <i>are</i> sorrowful, and his work burdensome; even in the night his heart takes no rest. This also is vanity.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Nothing <i>is</i> better for a man <i>than</i> that he should eat and drink, and <i>that</i> his soul should enjoy good in his labor. This also, I saw, was from the hand of God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>For who can eat, or who can have enjoyment, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>more than I? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>For <i>God</i> gives wisdom and knowledge and joy to a man who <i>is</i> good in His sight; but to the sinner He gives the work of gathering and collecting, that he may give to <i>him who is</i> good before God.
