Obey Authorities for God&#8217;s Sake</span></h3><p><span class="text Eccl-8-2"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>I <i>say,</i> &#8220;Keep the king&#8217;s commandment for the sake of your oath to God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Do not be hasty to go from his presence. Do not take your stand for an evil thing, for he does whatever pleases him.&#8221;</span></p> <div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Where the word of a king <i>is, there is</i> power;</span><br /><span class="text Eccl-8-4">And who may say to him, &#8220;What are you doing?&#8221;</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>He who keeps his command will experience nothing harmful;</span><br /><span class="text Eccl-8-5">And a wise man&#8217;s heart <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>discerns both time and judgment,</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Because for every matter there is a time and judgment,</span><br /><span class="text Eccl-8-6">Though the misery of man <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>increases greatly.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For he does not know what will happen;</span><br /><span class="text Eccl-8-7">So who can tell him when it will occur?</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>No one has power over the spirit to retain the spirit,</span><br /><span class="text Eccl-8-8">And no one has power in the day of death.</span><br /><span class="text Eccl-8-8"><i>There is</i> no release from that war,</span><br /><span class="text Eccl-8-8">And wickedness will not deliver those who are given to it.</span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>All this I have seen, and applied my heart to every work that is done under the sun: <i>There is</i> a time in which one man rules over another to his own hurt.</span></p> <h3>
Death Comes to All</span></h3><p><span class="text Eccl-8-10"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of holiness, and they were forgotten<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span> in the city where they had so done. This also <i>is</i> vanity. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Because the sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Though a sinner does evil a hundred <i>times,</i> and his <i>days</i> are prolonged, yet I surely know that it will be well with those who fear God, who fear before Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>But it will not be well with the wicked; nor will he prolong <i>his</i> days, <i>which are</i> as a shadow, because he does not fear before God.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>There is a vanity which occurs on earth, that there are just <i>men</i> to whom it happens according to the work of the wicked; again, there are wicked <i>men</i> to whom it happens according to the work of the righteous. I said that this also <i>is</i> vanity.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So I commended enjoyment, because a man has nothing better under the sun than to eat, drink, and be merry; for this will remain with him in his labor <i>all</i> the days of his life which God gives him under the sun.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>When I applied my heart to know wisdom and to see the business that is done on earth, even though one sees no sleep day or night, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>then I saw all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun. For though a man labors to discover <i>it,</i> yet he will not find <i>it;</i> moreover, though a wise <i>man</i> attempts to know <i>it,</i> he will not be able to find <i>it.</i></span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-17460a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ecclesiastes 8:1">Ecclesiastes 8:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>strength</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-17464b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ecclesiastes 8:5">Ecclesiastes 8:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>knows</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-17465c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ecclesiastes 8:6">Ecclesiastes 8:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>is great upon him</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-17469d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ecclesiastes 8:10">Ecclesiastes 8:10</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Some Heb. mss., LXX, Vg. <i>praised</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
