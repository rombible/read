<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>For if there should come into your assembly a man with gold rings, in <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>fine apparel, and there should also come in a poor man in <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>filthy clothes, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and you <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>pay attention to the one wearing the fine clothes and say to him, &#8220;You sit here in a good place,&#8221; and say to the poor man, &#8220;You stand there,&#8221; or, &#8220;Sit here at my footstool,&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>have you not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>shown partiality among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Listen, my beloved brethren: Has God not chosen the poor of this world <i>to be</i> rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which He promised to those who love Him? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But you have dishonored the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you and drag you into the courts? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Do they not blaspheme that noble name by which you are called?</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>If you really fulfill <i>the</i> royal law according to the Scripture, <span class="oblique">&#8220;You shall love your neighbor as yourself,&#8221;</span> you do well; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>but if you <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>show partiality, you commit sin, and are convicted by the law as transgressors. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one <i>point,</i> he is guilty of all. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For He who said, <span class="oblique">&#8220;Do not commit adultery,&#8221;</span> also said, <span class="oblique">&#8220;Do not murder.&#8221;</span> Now if you do not commit adultery, but you do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So speak and so do as those who will be judged by the law of liberty. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For judgment is without mercy to the one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.</span></p> <h3>
Faith Without Works Is Dead</span></h3><p><span class="text Jas-2-14"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>What <i>does it</i> profit, my brethren, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can faith save him? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>and one of you says to them, &#8220;Depart in peace, be warmed and filled,&#8221; but you do not give them the things which are needed for the body, what <i>does it</i> profit? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Thus also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>But someone will say, &#8220;You have faith, and I have works.&#8221; Show me your faith without <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>your works, and I will show you my faith by <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>my works. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>You believe that there is one God. You do well. Even the demons believe&#8212;and tremble! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>But do you want to know, O foolish man, that faith without works is <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>dead? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered Isaac his son on the altar? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Do you see that faith was working together with his works, and by works faith was made <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>perfect? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, <span class="oblique">&#8220;Abraham believed God, and it was</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span><span class="oblique">accounted to him for righteousness.&#8221;</span> And he was called the friend of God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>You see then that a man is justified by works, and not by faith only.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Likewise, was not Rahab the harlot also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent <i>them</i> out another way?</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-30296a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to James 2:2">James 2:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>bright</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30296b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to James 2:2">James 2:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>vile</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30297c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to James 2:3">James 2:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>look upon</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30298d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to James 2:4">James 2:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>differentiated</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30303e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to James 2:9">James 2:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>receive the face</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30312f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to James 2:18">James 2:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>your</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30312g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to James 2:18">James 2:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>my</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30314h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to James 2:20">James 2:20</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>useless</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30316i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to James 2:22">James 2:22</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>complete</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30317j"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to James 2:23">James 2:23</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>credited</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
