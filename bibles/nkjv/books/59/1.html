Profiting from Trials</span></h3><p><span class="text Jas-1-2"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>knowing that the testing of your faith produces <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>patience. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But let patience have <i>its</i> perfect work, that you may be <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>perfect and complete, lacking nothing. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven and tossed by the wind. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For let not that man suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><i>he is</i> a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.</span></p> <h3>
The Perspective of Rich and Poor</span></h3><p><span class="text Jas-1-9"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Let the lowly brother glory in his exaltation, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>but the rich in his humiliation, because as a flower of the field he will pass away. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For no sooner has the sun risen with a burning heat than it withers the grass; its flower falls, and its beautiful appearance perishes. So the rich man also will fade away in his pursuits.</span></p> <h3>
Loving God Under Trials</span></h3><p><span class="text Jas-1-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Blessed <i>is</i> the man who endures temptation; for when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Let no one say when he is tempted, &#8220;I am tempted by God&#8221;; for God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He Himself tempt anyone. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires and enticed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then, when desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, brings forth death.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Do not be deceived, my beloved brethren. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow of turning. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/1-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Of His own will He brought us forth by the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures.</span></p> <h3>
Qualities Needed in Trials</span></h3><p><span class="text Jas-1-19"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/1-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>So then, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/1-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>for the wrath of man does not produce the righteousness of God.</span></p> <h3>
Doers&#8212;Not Hearers Only</span></h3><p><span class="text Jas-1-21"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/1-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Therefore lay aside all filthiness and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>overflow of wickedness, and receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/1-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/1-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man observing his natural face in a mirror; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/1-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>for he observes himself, goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of man he was. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/1-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>But he who looks into the perfect law of liberty and continues <i>in it,</i> and is not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work, this one will be blessed in what he does.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/1-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>If anyone <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>among you thinks he is religious, and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his own heart, this one&#8217;s religion <i>is</i> useless. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/1-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their trouble, <i>and</i> to keep oneself unspotted from the world.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-30270a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to James 1:3">James 1:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>endurance</i> or <i>perseverance</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30271b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to James 1:4">James 1:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>mature</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30286c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to James 1:19">James 1:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>Know this</i> or <i>This you know</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30288d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to James 1:21">James 1:21</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>abundance</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30293e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to James 1:26">James 1:26</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>among you</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
