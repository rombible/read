<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and keep His commandments. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments. And His commandments are not burdensome. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For whatever is born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world&#8212;<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>our faith. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Who is he who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?</span></p> <h3>
The Certainty of God&#8217;s Witness</span></h3><p><span class="text 1John-5-6"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>This is He who came by water and blood&#8212;Jesus Christ; not only by water, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit who bears witness, because the Spirit is truth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For there are three that bear witness <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And there are three that bear witness on earth: the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and these three agree as one.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater; for this is the witness of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>God which He has testified of His Son. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>He who believes in the Son of God has the witness in himself; he who does not believe God has made Him a liar, because he has not believed the testimony that God has given of His Son. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And this is the testimony: that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>He who has the Son has <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/5-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>and that you may <i>continue to</i> believe in the name of the Son of God.</span></p> <h3>
Confidence and Compassion in Prayer</span></h3><p><span class="text 1John-5-14"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/5-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Now this is the confidence that we have in Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/5-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And if we know that He hears us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we have asked of Him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/5-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>If anyone sees his brother sinning a sin <i>which does</i> not <i>lead</i> to death, he will ask, and He will give him life for those who commit sin not <i>leading</i> to death. There is sin <i>leading</i> to death. I do not say that he should pray about that. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/5-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>All unrighteousness is sin, and there is sin not <i>leading</i> to death.</span></p> <h3>
Knowing the True&#8212;Rejecting the False</span></h3><p><span class="text 1John-5-18"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/5-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>We know that whoever is born of God does not sin; but he who has been born of God keeps<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>himself, and the wicked one does not touch him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/5-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies <i>under the sway of</i> the wicked one.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/5-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us an understanding, that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life.</span></p> <p>
