<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>By this you know the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and every spirit that does not confess <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>that Jesus <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>Christ has come in the flesh is not of God. And this is the <i>spirit</i> of the Antichrist, which you have heard was coming, and is now already in the world.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>You are of God, little children, and have overcome them, because He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>They are of the world. Therefore they speak <i>as</i> of the world, and the world hears them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>We are of God. He who knows God hears us; he who is not of God does not hear us. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.</span></p> <h3>
Knowing God Through Love</span></h3><p><span class="text 1John-4-7"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God; and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>He who does not love does not know God, for God is love. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>In this the love of God was manifested toward us, that God has sent His only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son <i>to be</i> the propitiation for our sins. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.</span></p> <h3>
Seeing God Through Love</span></h3><p><span class="text 1John-4-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>No one has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God abides in us, and His love has been perfected in us. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>By this we know that we abide in Him, and He in us, because He has given us of His Spirit. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/4-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son <i>as</i> Savior of the world. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/4-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/4-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And we have known and believed the love that God has for us. God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God, and God in him.</span></p> <h3>
The Consummation of Love</span></h3><p><span class="text 1John-4-17"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/4-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Love has been perfected among us in this: that we may have boldness in the day of judgment; because as He is, so are we in this world. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/4-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves torment. But he who fears has not been made perfect in love. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/4-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>We love <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Him because He first loved us.</span></p> <h3>
Obedience by Faith</span></h3><p><span class="text 1John-4-20"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/4-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>If someone says, &#8220;I love God,&#8221; and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>how can he love God whom he has not seen? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/4-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And this commandment we have from Him: that he who loves God <i>must</i> love his brother also.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-30607a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 John 4:3">1 John 4:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>that</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30607b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 John 4:3">1 John 4:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>Christ has come in the flesh</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30623c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 John 4:19">1 John 4:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>Him</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30624d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 John 4:20">1 John 4:20</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>he cannot</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
