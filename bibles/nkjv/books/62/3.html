Therefore the world does not know <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>us, because it did not know Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Beloved, now we are children of God; and it has not yet been revealed what we shall be, but we know that when He is revealed, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And everyone who has this hope in Him purifies himself, just as He is pure.</span></p> <h3>
Sin and the Child of God</span></h3><p><span class="text 1John-3-4"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Whoever commits sin also commits lawlessness, and sin is lawlessness. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And you know that He was manifested to take away our sins, and in Him there is no sin. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Whoever abides in Him does not sin. Whoever sins has neither seen Him nor known Him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Little children, let no one deceive you. He who practices righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>He who sins is of the devil, for the devil has sinned from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Whoever has been born of God does not sin, for His seed remains in him; and he cannot sin, because he has been born of God.</span></p> <h3>
The Imperative of Love</span></h3><p><span class="text 1John-3-10"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>In this the children of God and the children of the devil are manifest: Whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor <i>is</i> he who does not love his brother. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For this is the message that you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>not as Cain <i>who</i> was of the wicked one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his works were evil and his brother&#8217;s righteous.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Do not marvel, my brethren, if the world hates you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren. He who does not love <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span><i>his</i> brother abides in death. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Whoever hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.</span></p> <h3>
The Outworking of Love</span></h3><p><span class="text 1John-3-16"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>By this we know love, because He laid down His life for us. And we also ought to lay down <i>our</i> lives for the brethren. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But whoever has this world&#8217;s goods, and sees his brother in need, and shuts up his heart from him, how does the love of God abide in him?</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>My little children, let us not love in word or in tongue, but in deed and in truth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And by this we <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>know that we are of the truth, and shall <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>assure our hearts before Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>For if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence toward God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And whatever we ask we receive from Him, because we keep His commandments and do those things that are pleasing in His sight. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And this is His commandment: that we should believe on the name of His Son Jesus Christ and love one another, as He gave <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>us commandment.</span></p> <h3>
The Spirit of Truth and the Spirit of Error</span></h3><p><span class="text 1John-3-24"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Now he who keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in him. And by this we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He has given us.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-30581a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 John 3:1">1 John 3:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU adds <i>And we are.</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30581b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 John 3:1">1 John 3:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>M <i>you</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30594c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 John 3:14">1 John 3:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>his brother</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30599d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 John 3:19">1 John 3:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>shall know</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30599e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 John 3:19">1 John 3:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>persuade, set at rest</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30603f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 John 3:23">1 John 3:23</span> <span class='footnote-text'>M omits <i>us</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
