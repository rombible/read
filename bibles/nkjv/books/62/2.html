And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the whole world.</span></p> <h3>
The Test of Knowing Him</span></h3><p><span class="text 1John-2-3"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Now by this we know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>He who says, &#8220;I know Him,&#8221; and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But whoever keeps His word, truly the love of God <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>is perfected in him. By this we know that we are in Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>He who says he abides in Him ought himself also to walk just as He walked.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>Brethren, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you heard <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>from the beginning. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Again, a new commandment I write to you, which thing is true in Him and in you, because the darkness is passing away, and the true light is already shining.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>He who says he is in the light, and hates his brother, is in darkness until now. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>He who loves his brother abides in the light, and there is no cause for stumbling in him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But he who hates his brother is in darkness and walks in darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.</span></p> <h3>
Their Spiritual State</span></h3><div class="poetry"><p class="line"><span class="text 1John-2-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>I write to you, little children,</span><br /><span class="text 1John-2-12">Because your sins are forgiven you for His name&#8217;s sake.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>I write to you, fathers,</span><br /><span class="text 1John-2-13">Because you have known Him <i>who is</i> from the beginning.</span><br /><span class="text 1John-2-13">I write to you, young men,</span><br /><span class="text 1John-2-13">Because you have overcome the wicked one.</span><br /><span class="text 1John-2-13">I write to you, little children,</span><br /><span class="text 1John-2-13">Because you have known the Father.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>I have written to you, fathers,</span><br /><span class="text 1John-2-14">Because you have known Him <i>who is</i> from the beginning.</span><br /><span class="text 1John-2-14">I have written to you, young men,</span><br /><span class="text 1John-2-14">Because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you,</span><br /><span class="text 1John-2-14">And you have overcome the wicked one.</span></p></div> <h3>
Do Not Love the World</span></h3><p><span class="text 1John-2-15"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>For all that <i>is</i> in the world&#8212;the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life&#8212;is not of the Father but is of the world. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And the world is passing away, and the lust of it; but he who does the will of God abides forever.</span></p> <h3>
Deceptions of the Last Hour</span></h3><p><span class="text 1John-2-18"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Little children, it is the last hour; and as you have heard that the<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span> Antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come, by which we know that it is the last hour. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us; but <i>they went out</i> that they might be made manifest, that none of them were of us.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span> know all things. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and that no lie is of the truth.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Who is a liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist who denies the Father and the Son. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Whoever denies the Son does not have the Father either; he who acknowledges the Son has the Father also.</span></p> <h3>
Let Truth Abide in You</span></h3><p><span class="text 1John-2-24"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Therefore let that abide in you which you heard from the beginning. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, you also will abide in the Son and in the Father. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And this is the promise that He has promised us&#8212;eternal life.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>These things I have written to you concerning those who <i>try to</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>deceive you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>But the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you do not need that anyone teach you; but as the same anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is not a lie, and just as it has taught you, you <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>will abide in Him.</span></p> <h3>
The Children of God</span></h3><p><span class="text 1John-2-28"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And now, little children, abide in Him, that <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>when He appears, we may have confidence and not be ashamed before Him at His coming. </span>
