<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>(<i>this was</i> only so that the generations of the children of Israel might be taught to know war, at least those who had not formerly known it), </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span><i>namely,</i> five lords of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites who dwelt in Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal Hermon to the entrance of Hamath. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And they were <i>left, that He might</i> test Israel by them, to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>know whether they would obey the commandments of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, which He had commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Thus the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons; and they served their gods.</span></p> <h3>
Othniel</span></h3><p><span class="text Judg-3-7"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. They forgot the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> their God, and served the Baals and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Asherahs. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Therefore the anger of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was hot against Israel, and He sold them into the hand of Cushan-Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia; and the children of Israel served Cushan-Rishathaim eight years. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>When the children of Israel cried out to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> raised up a deliverer for the children of Israel, who delivered them: Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb&#8217;s younger brother. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>The Spirit of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came upon him, and he judged Israel. He went out to war, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> delivered Cushan-Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed over Cushan-Rishathaim. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So the land had rest for forty years. Then Othniel the son of Kenaz died.</span></p> <h3>
Ehud</span></h3><p><span class="text Judg-3-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> strengthened Eglon king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then he gathered to himself the people of Ammon and Amalek, went and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>defeated Israel, and took possession of the City of Palms. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So the children of Israel served Eglon king of Moab eighteen years.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But when the children of Israel cried out to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> raised up a deliverer for them: Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a left-handed man. By him the children of Israel sent tribute to Eglon king of Moab. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/3-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Now Ehud made himself a dagger (it was double-edged and a cubit in length) and fastened it under his clothes on his right thigh. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So he brought the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. (Now Eglon <i>was</i> a very fat man.) </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/3-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And when he had finished presenting the tribute, he sent away the people who had carried the tribute. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/3-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>But he himself turned back from the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>stone images that <i>were</i> at Gilgal, and said, &#8220;I have a secret message for you, O king.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-3-19">He said, &#8220;Keep silence!&#8221; And all who attended him went out from him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/3-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So Ehud came to him (now he was sitting upstairs in his cool private chamber). Then Ehud said, &#8220;I have a message from God for you.&#8221; So he arose from <i>his</i> seat. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/3-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then Ehud reached with his left hand, took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/3-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Even the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>hilt went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade, for he did not draw the dagger out of his belly; and his entrails came out. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/3-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Then Ehud went out through the porch and shut the doors of the upper room behind him and locked them.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/3-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>When he had gone out, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span><i>Eglon&#8217;s</i> servants came to look, and <i>to their</i> surprise, the doors of the upper room were locked. So they said, &#8220;He is probably attending<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span> to his needs in the cool chamber.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/3-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>So they waited till they were embarrassed, and still he had not opened the doors of the upper room. Therefore they took the key and opened <i>them.</i> And there was their master, fallen dead on the floor.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/3-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>But Ehud had escaped while they delayed, and passed beyond the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>stone images and escaped to Seirah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/3-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And it happened, when he arrived, that he blew the trumpet in the mountains of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mountains; and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>he led them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/3-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then he said to them, &#8220;Follow <i>me,</i> for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand.&#8221; So they went down after him, seized the fords of the Jordan leading to Moab, and did not allow anyone to cross over. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/3-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And at that time they killed about ten thousand men of Moab, all stout men of valor; not a man escaped. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/3-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest for eighty years.</span></p> <h3>
