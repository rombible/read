<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Now there was a certain man from Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name <i>was</i> Manoah; and his wife <i>was</i> barren and had no children. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And the Angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> appeared to the woman and said to her, &#8220;Indeed now, you are barren and have borne no children, but you shall conceive and bear a son. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Now therefore, please be careful not to drink wine or <i>similar</i> drink, and not to eat anything unclean. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For behold, you shall conceive and bear a son. And no razor shall come upon his head, for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb; and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So the woman came and told her husband, saying, &#8220;A Man of God came to me, and His countenance<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span> <i>was</i> like the countenance of the Angel of God, very awesome; but I did not ask Him where He <i>was</i> from, and He did not tell me His name. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And He said to me, &#8216;Behold, you shall conceive and bear a son. Now drink no wine or <i>similar</i> drink, nor eat anything unclean, for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of his death.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then Manoah prayed to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and said, &#8220;O my Lord, please let the Man of God whom You sent come to us again and teach us what we shall do for the child who will be born.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And God listened to the voice of Manoah, and the Angel of God came to the woman again as she was sitting in the field; but Manoah her husband <i>was</i> not with her. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then the woman ran in haste and told her husband, and said to him, &#8220;Look, the Man who came to me the <i>other</i> day has just now appeared to me!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So Manoah arose and followed his wife. When he came to the Man, he said to Him, &#8220;Are You the Man who spoke to this woman?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-13-11">And He said, &#8220;I <i>am.</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Manoah said, &#8220;Now let Your words come <i>to pass!</i> What will be the boy&#8217;s rule of life, and his work?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So the Angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Manoah, &#8220;Of all that I said to the woman let her be careful. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>She may not eat anything that comes from the vine, nor may she drink wine or <i>similar</i> drink, nor eat anything unclean. All that I commanded her let her observe.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then Manoah said to the Angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, &#8220;Please let us detain You, and we will prepare a young goat for You.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And the Angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Manoah, &#8220;Though you detain Me, I will not eat your food. But if you offer a burnt offering, you must offer it to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221; (For Manoah did not know He <i>was</i> the Angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.)</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then Manoah said to the Angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, &#8220;What <i>is</i> Your name, that when Your words come <i>to pass</i> we may honor You?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And the Angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to him, &#8220;Why do you ask My name, seeing it <i>is</i> wonderful?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>So Manoah took the young goat with the grain offering, and offered it upon the rock to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. And He did a wondrous thing while Manoah and his wife looked on&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>it happened as the flame went up toward heaven from the altar&#8212;the Angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> ascended in the flame of the altar! When Manoah and his wife saw <i>this,</i> they fell on their faces to the ground. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>When the Angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> appeared no more to Manoah and his wife, then Manoah knew that He <i>was</i> the Angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And Manoah said to his wife, &#8220;We shall surely die, because we have seen God!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>But his wife said to him, &#8220;If the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had desired to kill us, He would not have accepted a burnt offering and a grain offering from our hands, nor would He have shown us all these <i>things,</i> nor would He have told us <i>such things</i> as these at this time.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>So the woman bore a son and called his name Samson; and the child grew, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> blessed him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And the Spirit of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> began to move upon him at <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>Mahaneh Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-6891a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 13:6">Judges 13:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>appearance</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6910b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 13:25">Judges 13:25</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Camp of Dan,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Judg.18.12" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=Judg.18.12&amp;version=NKJV">Judg. 18:12</span></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
