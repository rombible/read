And in those days the tribe of the Danites was seeking an inheritance for itself to dwell in; for until that day <i>their</i> inheritance among the tribes of Israel had not fallen to them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So the children of Dan sent five men of their family from their territory, men of valor from Zorah and Eshtaol, to spy out the land and search it. They said to them, &#8220;Go, search the land.&#8221; So they went to the mountains of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and lodged there. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>While they <i>were</i> at the house of Micah, they recognized the voice of the young Levite. They turned aside and said to him, &#8220;Who brought you here? What are you doing in this <i>place?</i> What do you have here?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>He said to them, &#8220;Thus and so Micah did for me. He has hired me, and I have become his priest.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So they said to him, &#8220;Please inquire of God, that we may know whether the journey on which we go will be prosperous.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And the priest said to them, &#8220;Go in peace. <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>The presence of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>be</i> with you on your way.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So the five men departed and went to Laish. They saw the people who <i>were</i> there, how they dwelt safely, in the manner of the Sidonians, quiet and secure. <i>There were</i> no rulers in the land who might put <i>them</i> to shame for anything. They <i>were</i> far from the Sidonians, and they had no ties <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>with anyone.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then <i>the spies</i> came back to their brethren at Zorah and Eshtaol, and their brethren said to them, &#8220;What <i>is</i> your <i>report?</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So they said, &#8220;Arise, let us go up against them. For we have seen the land, and indeed it <i>is</i> very good. <i>Would</i> you <i>do</i> nothing? Do not hesitate to go, <i>and</i> enter to possess the land. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>When you go, you will come to a secure people and a large land. For God has given it into your hands, a place where <i>there is</i> no lack of anything that <i>is</i> on the earth.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And six hundred men of the family of the Danites went from there, from Zorah and Eshtaol, armed with weapons of war. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then they went up and encamped in Kirjath Jearim in Judah. (Therefore they call that place Mahaneh Dan<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> to this day. There <i>it is,</i> west of Kirjath Jearim.) </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And they passed from there to the mountains of Ephraim, and came to the house of Micah.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then the five men who had gone to spy out the country of Laish answered and said to their brethren, &#8220;Do you know that there are in these houses an ephod, household idols, a carved image, and a molded image? Now therefore, consider what you should do.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So they turned aside there, and came to the house of the young Levite man&#8212;to the house of Micah&#8212;and greeted him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>The six hundred men armed with their weapons of war, who <i>were</i> of the children of Dan, stood by the entrance of the gate. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then the five men who had gone to spy out the land went up. Entering there, they took the carved image, the ephod, the household idols, and the molded image. The priest stood at the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men <i>who were</i> armed with weapons of war.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>When these went into Micah&#8217;s house and took the carved image, the ephod, the household idols, and the molded image, the priest said to them, &#8220;What are you doing?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And they said to him, &#8220;Be quiet, put your hand over your mouth, and come with us; be a father and a priest to us. <i>Is it</i> better for you to be a priest to the household of one man, or that you be a priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So the priest&#8217;s heart was glad; and he took the ephod, the household idols, and the carved image, and took his place among the people.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then they turned and departed, and put the little ones, the livestock, and the goods in front of them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>When they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men who <i>were</i> in the houses near Micah&#8217;s house gathered together and overtook the children of Dan. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And they called out to the children of Dan. So they turned around and said to Micah, &#8220;What ails you, that you have gathered such a company?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>So he said, &#8220;You have taken away my <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>gods which I made, and the priest, and you have gone away. Now what more do I have? How can you say to me, &#8216;What ails you?&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And the children of Dan said to him, &#8220;Do not let your voice be heard among us, lest <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>angry men fall upon you, and you lose your life, with the lives of your household!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Then the children of Dan went their way. And when Micah saw that they <i>were</i> too strong for him, he turned and went back to his house.</span></p> <h3>
Danites Settle in Laish</span></h3><p><span class="text Judg-18-27"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>So they took <i>the things</i> Micah had made, and the priest who had belonged to him, and went to Laish, to a people quiet and secure; and they struck them with the edge of the sword and burned the city with fire. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span><i>There was</i> no deliverer, because it <i>was</i> far from Sidon, and they had no ties with anyone. It was in the valley that belongs to Beth Rehob. So they rebuilt the city and dwelt there. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel. However, the name of the city formerly <i>was</i> Laish.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Then the children of Dan set up for themselves the carved image; and Jonathan the son of Gershom, the son of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>Manasseh, and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/18-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>So they set up for themselves Micah&#8217;s carved image which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-7000a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 18:6">Judges 18:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>The <span class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> is before the way in which you go</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7001b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 18:7">Judges 18:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'>So with MT, Tg., Vg.; LXX <i>with Syria</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7006c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 18:12">Judges 18:12</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Camp of Dan</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7018d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 18:24">Judges 18:24</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>idols</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7019e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 18:25">Judges 18:25</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>bitter of soul</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7024f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 18:30">Judges 18:30</span> <span class='footnote-text'>LXX, Vg. <i>Moses</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
