<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Please speak in the hearing of all the men of Shechem: &#8216;Which is better for you, that all seventy of the sons of Jerubbaal reign over you, or that one reign over you?&#8217; Remember that I <i>am</i> your own flesh and bone.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And his mother&#8217;s brothers spoke all these words concerning him in the hearing of all the men of Shechem; and their heart was inclined to follow Abimelech, for they said, &#8220;He is our brother.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So they gave him seventy <i>shekels</i> of silver from the temple of Baal-Berith, with which Abimelech hired worthless and reckless men; and they followed him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then he went to his father&#8217;s house at Ophrah and killed his brothers, the seventy sons of Jerubbaal, on one stone. But Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left, because he hid himself. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And all the men of Shechem gathered together, all of Beth Millo, and they went and made Abimelech king beside the terebinth tree at the pillar that <i>was</i> in Shechem.</span></p> <h3>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>&#8220;Now therefore, if you have acted in truth and sincerity in making Abimelech king, and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done to him as<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span> he deserves&#8212; </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>if then you have acted in truth and sincerity with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, <i>then</i> rejoice in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you. </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And Jotham ran away and fled; and he went to Beer and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.</span></p> <h3>
Downfall of Abimelech</span></h3><p><span class="text Judg-9-22"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>After Abimelech had reigned over Israel three years, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>God sent a spirit of ill will between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>that the crime <i>done</i> to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might be settled and their blood be laid on Abimelech their brother, who killed them, and on the men of Shechem, who aided him in the killing of his brothers. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And the men of Shechem set <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>men in ambush against him on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed all who passed by them along that way; and it was told Abimelech.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Now Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brothers and went over to Shechem; and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>So they went out into the fields, and gathered <i>grapes</i> from their vineyards and trod <i>them,</i> and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>made merry. And they went into the house of their god, and ate and drank, and cursed Abimelech. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then Gaal the son of Ebed said, &#8220;Who <i>is</i> Abimelech, and who <i>is</i> Shechem, that we should serve him? <i>Is he</i> not the son of Jerubbaal, and <i>is not</i> Zebul his officer? Serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem; but why should we serve him? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>If only this people were under my <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>authority! Then I would remove Abimelech.&#8221; So <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>he said to Abimelech, &#8220;Increase your army and come out!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>When Zebul, the ruler of the city, heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was aroused. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>And he sent messengers to Abimelech secretly, saying, &#8220;Take note! Gaal the son of Ebed and his brothers have come to Shechem; and here they are, fortifying the city against you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Now therefore, get up by night, you and the people who <i>are</i> with you, and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>lie in wait in the field. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And it shall be, as soon as the sun is up in the morning, <i>that</i> you shall rise early and rush upon the city; and <i>when</i> he and the people who are with him come out against you, you may then do to them <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>as you find opportunity.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>So Abimelech and all the people who <i>were</i> with him rose by night, and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>lay in wait against Shechem in four companies. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>When Gaal the son of Ebed went out and stood in the entrance to the city gate, Abimelech and the people who <i>were</i> with him rose from lying in wait. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, &#8220;Look, people are coming down from the tops of the mountains!&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-9-36">But Zebul said to him, &#8220;You see the shadows of the mountains as <i>if they were</i> men.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>So Gaal spoke again and said, &#8220;See, people are coming down from the center of the land, and another company is coming from the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>Diviners&#8217; Terebinth Tree.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>Then Zebul said to him, &#8220;Where indeed <i>is</i> your mouth now, with which you said, &#8216;Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him?&#8217; <i>Are</i> not these the people whom you despised? Go out, if you will, and fight with them now.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>So Gaal went out, leading the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>And Abimelech chased him, and he fled from him; and many fell wounded, to the <i>very</i> entrance of the gate. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>Then Abimelech dwelt at Arumah, and Zebul <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>drove out Gaal and his brothers, so that they would not dwell in Shechem.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>And it came about on the next day that the people went out into the field, and they told Abimelech. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>So he took his people, divided them into three companies, and lay in wait in the field. And he looked, and there were the people, coming out of the city; and he rose against them and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span>attacked them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>Then Abimelech and the company that <i>was</i> with him rushed forward and stood at the entrance of the gate of the city; and the <i>other</i> two companies rushed upon all who <i>were</i> in the fields and killed them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>So Abimelech fought against the city all that day; he took the city and killed the people who <i>were</i> in it; and he demolished the city and sowed it with salt.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span>Now when all the men of the tower of Shechem had heard <i>that,</i> they entered the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[l]</a></span>stronghold of the temple of the god Berith. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-47.htm"><b>47</b></a></span>And it was told Abimelech that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-48.htm"><b>48</b></a></span>Then Abimelech went up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the people who <i>were</i> with him. And Abimelech took an ax in his hand and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it and laid <i>it</i> on his shoulder; then he said to the people who were with him, &#8220;What you have seen me do, make haste <i>and</i> do as I <i>have done.</i>&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-49.htm"><b>49</b></a></span>So each of the people likewise cut down his own bough and followed Abimelech, put <i>them</i> against the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[m]</a></span>stronghold, and set the stronghold on fire above them, so that all the people of the tower of Shechem died, about a thousand men and women.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-50.htm"><b>50</b></a></span>Then Abimelech went to Thebez, and he <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[n]</a></span>encamped against Thebez and took it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-51.htm"><b>51</b></a></span>But there was a strong tower in the city, and all the men and women&#8212;all the people of the city&#8212;fled there and shut themselves in; then they went up to the top of the tower. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-52.htm"><b>52</b></a></span>So Abimelech came as far as the tower and fought against it; and he drew near the door of the tower to burn it with fire. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-53.htm"><b>53</b></a></span>But a certain woman dropped an upper millstone on Abimelech&#8217;s head and crushed his skull. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-54.htm"><b>54</b></a></span>Then he called quickly to the young man, his armorbearer, and said to him, &#8220;Draw your sword and kill me, lest men say of me, &#8216;A woman killed him.&#8217; &#8221; So his young man thrust him through, and he died. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-55.htm"><b>55</b></a></span>And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed, every man to his <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[o]</a></span>place.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-56.htm"><b>56</b></a></span>Thus God repaid the wickedness of Abimelech, which he had done to his father by killing his seventy brothers. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-57.htm"><b>57</b></a></span>And all the evil of the men of Shechem God returned on their own heads, and on them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-6771a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 9:16">Judges 9:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>according to the doing of his hands</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6780b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 9:25">Judges 9:25</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>liers-in-wait for</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6782c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 9:27">Judges 9:27</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>rejoiced</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6784d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 9:29">Judges 9:29</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>hand</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6784e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 9:29">Judges 9:29</span> <span class='footnote-text'>So with MT, Tg.; DSS <i>they;</i> LXX <i>I</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6787f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 9:32">Judges 9:32</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Set up an ambush</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6788g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 9:33">Judges 9:33</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>as your hand can find</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6789h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 9:34">Judges 9:34</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Set up an ambush</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6792i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 9:37">Judges 9:37</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. <i>Meonenim</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6796j"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 9:41">Judges 9:41</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>exiled</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6798k"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 9:43">Judges 9:43</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>struck</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6801l"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 9:46">Judges 9:46</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>fortified room</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6804m"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 9:49">Judges 9:49</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>fortified room</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6805n"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 9:50">Judges 9:50</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>besieged</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6810o"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 9:55">Judges 9:55</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>home</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
