<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor. The commander of his army <i>was</i> Sisera, who dwelt in Harosheth Hagoyim. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And the children of Israel cried out to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; for Jabin had nine hundred chariots of iron, and for twenty years he had harshly oppressed the children of Israel.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, was judging Israel at that time. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And she would sit under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the mountains of Ephraim. And the children of Israel came up to her for judgment. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then she sent and called for Barak the son of Abinoam from Kedesh in Naphtali, and said to him, &#8220;Has not the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel commanded, &#8216;Go and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>deploy <i>troops</i> at Mount Tabor; take with you ten thousand men of the sons of Naphtali and of the sons of Zebulun; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and against you I will deploy Sisera, the commander of Jabin&#8217;s army, with his chariots and his multitude at the River Kishon; and I will <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>deliver him into your hand&#8217;?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And Barak said to her, &#8220;If you will go with me, then I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So she said, &#8220;I will surely go with you; nevertheless there will be no glory for you in the journey you are taking, for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman.&#8221; Then Deborah arose and went with Barak to Kedesh. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; he went up with ten thousand men under<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> his command, and Deborah went up with him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now Heber the Kenite, of the children of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, had separated himself from the Kenites and pitched his tent near the terebinth tree at Zaanaim, which <i>is</i> beside Kedesh.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And they reported to Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So Sisera gathered together all his chariots, nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people who <i>were</i> with him, from Harosheth Hagoyim to the River Kishon.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/4-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then Deborah said to Barak, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>&#8220;Up! For this <i>is</i> the day in which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has delivered Sisera into your hand. Has not the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> gone out before you?&#8221; So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with ten thousand men following him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/4-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> routed Sisera and all <i>his</i> chariots and all <i>his</i> army with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sisera alighted from <i>his</i> chariot and fled away on foot. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/4-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But Barak pursued the chariots and the army as far as Harosheth Hagoyim, and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; not a man was left.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/4-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>However, Sisera had fled away on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite; for <i>there was</i> peace between Jabin king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/4-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, &#8220;Turn aside, my lord, turn aside to me; do not fear.&#8221; And when he had turned aside with her into the tent, she covered him with a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>blanket.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/4-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then he said to her, &#8220;Please give me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty.&#8221; So she opened a jug of milk, gave him a drink, and covered him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/4-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And he said to her, &#8220;Stand at the door of the tent, and if any man comes and inquires of you, and says, &#8216;Is there any man here?&#8217; you shall say, &#8216;No.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/4-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then Jael, Heber&#8217;s wife, took a tent peg and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly to him and drove the peg into his temple, and it went down into the ground; for he was fast asleep and weary. So he died. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/4-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And then, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said to him, &#8220;Come, I will show you the man whom you seek.&#8221; And when he went into her <i>tent,</i> there lay Sisera, dead with the peg in his temple.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/4-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>So on that day God subdued Jabin king of Canaan in the presence of the children of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/4-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And the hand of the children of Israel grew stronger and stronger against Jabin king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-6606a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 4:6">Judges 4:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>march</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6607b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 4:7">Judges 4:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>draw</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6610c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 4:10">Judges 4:10</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>at his feet</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6614d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 4:14">Judges 4:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Arise!</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6618e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 4:18">Judges 4:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>rug</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
