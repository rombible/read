<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And you shall make no <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>covenant with the inhabitants of this land; you shall tear down their altars.&#8217; But you have not obeyed My voice. Why have you done this? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Therefore I also said, &#8216;I will not drive them out before you; but they shall be <i>thorns</i><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span> in your side, and their gods shall <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>be a snare to you.&#8217; &#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So it was, when the Angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> spoke these words to all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voices and wept.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then they called the name of that place <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>Bochim; and they sacrificed there to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And when Joshua had dismissed the people, the children of Israel went each to his own inheritance to possess the land.</span></p> <h3>
Death of Joshua</span></h3><p><span class="text Judg-2-7"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So the people served the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> which He had done for Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Now Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, died <i>when he was</i> one hundred and ten years old. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And they buried him within the border of his inheritance at Timnath Heres, in the mountains of Ephraim, on the north side of Mount Gaash. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>When all that generation had <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>been gathered to their fathers, another generation arose after them who did not know the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> nor the work which He had done for Israel.</span></p> <h3>
Israel&#8217;s Unfaithfulness</span></h3><p><span class="text Judg-2-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and served the Baals; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>and they forsook the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt; and they followed other gods from <i>among</i> the gods of the people who <i>were</i> all around them, and they bowed down to them; and they provoked the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> to anger. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>They forsook the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and served <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>Baal and the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>Ashtoreths. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And the anger of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was hot against Israel. So He delivered them into the hands of plunderers who despoiled them; and He sold them into the hands of their enemies all around, so that they could no longer stand before their enemies. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Wherever they went out, the hand of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was against them for calamity, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had said, and as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had sworn to them. And they were greatly distressed.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Nevertheless, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> raised up judges who delivered them out of the hand of those who plundered them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Yet they would not listen to their judges, but they played the harlot with other gods, and bowed down to them. They turned quickly from the way in which their fathers walked, in obeying the commandments of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; they did not do so. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And when the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> raised up judges for them, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was with the judge and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was moved to pity by their groaning because of those who oppressed them and harassed them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they reverted and behaved more corruptly than their fathers, by following other gods, to serve them and bow down to them. They did not cease from their own doings nor from their stubborn way.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then the anger of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was hot against Israel; and He said, &#8220;Because this nation has transgressed My covenant which I commanded their fathers, and has not heeded My voice, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>I also will no longer drive out before them any of the nations which Joshua left when he died, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>so that through them I may test Israel, whether they will keep the ways of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, to walk in them as their fathers kept <i>them,</i> or not.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Therefore the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> left those nations, without driving them out immediately; nor did He deliver them into the hand of Joshua.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-6548a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 2:2">Judges 2:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>treaty</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6549b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 2:3">Judges 2:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>LXX, Tg., Vg. <i>enemies to you</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6549c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 2:3">Judges 2:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>entrap you</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6551d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 2:5">Judges 2:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Weeping</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6556e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 2:10">Judges 2:10</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Died and joined their ancestors</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6559f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 2:13">Judges 2:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'>A Canaanite god</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6559g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 2:13">Judges 2:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Canaanite goddesses</span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
