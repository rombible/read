So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> delivered them into the hand of Midian for seven years, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel. Because of the Midianites, the children of Israel made for themselves the dens, the caves, and the strongholds which <i>are</i> in the mountains. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So it was, whenever Israel had sown, Midianites would come up; also Amalekites and the people of the East would come up against them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then they would encamp against them and destroy the produce of the earth as far as Gaza, and leave no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep nor ox nor donkey. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For they would come up with their livestock and their tents, coming in as numerous as locusts; both they and their camels were <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>without number; and they would enter the land to destroy it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites, and the children of Israel cried out to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried out to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> because of the Midianites, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> sent a prophet to the children of Israel, who said to them, &#8220;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel: &#8216;I brought you up from Egypt and brought you out of the house of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>bondage; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of all who oppressed you, and drove them out before you and gave you their land. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Also I said to you, &#8220;I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God; do not fear the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell.&#8221; But you have not obeyed My voice.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Gideon</span></h3><p><span class="text Judg-6-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now the Angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came and sat under the terebinth tree which <i>was</i> in Ophrah, which <i>belonged</i> to Joash the Abiezrite, while his son Gideon threshed wheat in the winepress, in order to hide <i>it</i> from the Midianites. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And the Angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> appeared to him, and said to him, &#8220;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>is</i> with you, you mighty man of valor!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Gideon said to Him, &#8220;O <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>my lord, if the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> is with us, why then has all this happened to us? And where <i>are</i> all His miracles which our fathers told us about, saying, &#8216;Did not the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> bring us up from Egypt?&#8217; But now the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> turned to him and said, &#8220;Go in this might of yours, and you shall save Israel from the hand of the Midianites. Have I not sent you?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So he said to Him, &#8220;O <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>my Lord, how can I save Israel? Indeed my clan <i>is</i> the weakest in Manasseh, and I <i>am</i> the least in my father&#8217;s house.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to him, &#8220;Surely I will be with you, and you shall <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>defeat the Midianites as one man.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then he said to Him, &#8220;If now I have found favor in Your sight, then show me a sign that it is You who talk with me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Do not depart from here, I pray, until I come to You and bring out my offering and set <i>it</i> before You.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-6-18">And He said, &#8220;I will wait until you come back.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>So Gideon went in and prepared a young goat, and unleavened bread from an ephah of flour. The meat he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot; and he brought <i>them</i> out to Him under the terebinth tree and presented <i>them.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>The Angel of God said to him, &#8220;Take the meat and the unleavened bread and lay <i>them</i> on this rock, and pour out the broth.&#8221; And he did so.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then the Angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> put out the end of the staff that <i>was</i> in His hand, and touched the meat and the unleavened bread; and fire rose out of the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened bread. And the Angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> departed out of his sight.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Now Gideon perceived that He <i>was</i> the Angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. So Gideon said, &#8220;Alas, O Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>! For I have seen the Angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> face to face.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to him, &#8220;Peace <i>be</i> with you; do not fear, you shall not die.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>So Gideon built an altar there to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and called it <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>The-<span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>-<i>Is</i>-Peace. To this day it <i>is</i> still in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Now it came to pass the same night that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to him, &#8220;Take your father&#8217;s young bull, the second bull of seven years old, and tear down the altar of Baal that your father has, and cut down the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>wooden image that <i>is</i> beside it; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>and build an altar to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God on top of this <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>rock in the proper arrangement, and take the second bull and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the image which you shall cut down.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>So Gideon took ten men from among his servants and did as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had said to him. But because he feared his father&#8217;s household and the men of the city too much to do <i>it</i> by day, he did <i>it</i> by night.</span></p> <h3>
Gideon Destroys the Altar of Baal</span></h3><p><span class="text Judg-6-28"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, there was the altar of Baal, torn down; and the wooden image that <i>was</i> beside it was cut down, and the second bull was being offered on the altar <i>which had been</i> built. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>So they said to one another, &#8220;Who has done this thing?&#8221; And when they had inquired and asked, they said, &#8220;Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Then the men of the city said to Joash, &#8220;Bring out your son, that he may die, because he has torn down the altar of Baal, and because he has cut down the wooden image that <i>was</i> beside it.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>But Joash said to all who stood against him, &#8220;Would you <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>plead for Baal? Would you save him? Let the one who would plead for him be put to death by morning! If he <i>is</i> a god, let him plead for himself, because his altar has been torn down!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal,<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span> saying, &#8220;Let Baal plead against him, because he has torn down his altar.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Then all the Midianites and Amalekites, the people of the East, gathered together; and they crossed over and encamped in the Valley of Jezreel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>But the Spirit of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came upon Gideon; then he blew the trumpet, and the Abiezrites gathered behind him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh, who also gathered behind him. He also sent messengers to Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.</span></p> <h3>
The Sign of the Fleece</span></h3><p><span class="text Judg-6-36"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>So Gideon said to God, &#8220;If You will save Israel by my hand as You have said&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>look, I shall put a fleece of wool on the threshing floor; if there is dew on the fleece only, and <i>it is</i> dry on all the ground, then I shall know that You will save Israel by my hand, as You have said.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>And it was so. When he rose early the next morning and squeezed the fleece together, he wrung the dew out of the fleece, a bowlful of water. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>Then Gideon said to God, &#8220;Do not be angry with me, but let me speak just once more: Let me test, I pray, just once more with the fleece; let it now be dry only on the fleece, but on all the ground let there be dew.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>And God did so that night.
