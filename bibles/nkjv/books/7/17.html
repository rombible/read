<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/17-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he said to his mother, &#8220;The eleven hundred <i>shekels</i> of silver that were taken from you, and on which you put a curse, even saying it in my ears&#8212;here <i>is</i> the silver with me; I took it.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-17-2">And his mother said, &#8220;<i>May you be</i> blessed by the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, my son!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/17-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So when he had returned the eleven hundred <i>shekels</i> of silver to his mother, his mother said, &#8220;I had wholly dedicated the silver from my hand to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> for my son, to make a carved image and a molded image; now therefore, I will return it to you.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/17-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Thus he returned the silver to his mother. Then his mother took two hundred <i>shekels</i> of silver and gave them to the silversmith, and he made it into a carved image and a molded image; and they were in the house of Micah.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/17-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>The man Micah had a shrine, and made an ephod and household<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span> idols; and he consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/17-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>In those days <i>there was</i> no king in Israel; everyone did <i>what was</i> right in his own eyes.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/17-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now there was a young man from Bethlehem in Judah, of the family of Judah; he <i>was</i> a Levite, and was staying there. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/17-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>The man departed from the city of Bethlehem in Judah to stay wherever he could find <i>a place.</i> Then he came to the mountains of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, as he journeyed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/17-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And Micah said to him, &#8220;Where do you come from?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-17-9">So he said to him, &#8220;I <i>am</i> a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, and I am on my way to find <i>a place</i> to stay.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/17-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Micah said to him, &#8220;Dwell with me, and be a father and a priest to me, and I will give you ten <i>shekels</i> of silver per year, a suit of clothes, and your sustenance.&#8221; So the Levite went in. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/17-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man became like one of his sons to him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/17-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So Micah consecrated<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span> the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and lived in the house of Micah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/17-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then Micah said, &#8220;Now I know that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will be good to me, since I have a Levite as priest!&#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-6986a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 17:5">Judges 17:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. <i>teraphim</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6993b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 17:12">Judges 17:12</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>filled the hand of</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
