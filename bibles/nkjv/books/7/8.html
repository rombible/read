<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So he said to them, &#8220;What have I done now in comparison with you? <i>Is</i> not the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>gleaning <i>of the grapes</i> of Ephraim better than <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>the vintage of Abiezer? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>God has delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb. And what was I able to do in comparison with you?&#8221; Then their anger toward him subsided when he said that.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>When Gideon came to the Jordan, he and the three hundred men who <i>were</i> with him crossed over, exhausted but still in pursuit. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then he said to the men of Succoth, &#8220;Please give loaves of bread to the people who follow me, for they are exhausted, and I am pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And the leaders of Succoth said, &#8220;<i>Are</i><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to your army?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So Gideon said, &#8220;For this cause, when the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then he went up from there to Penuel and spoke to them in the same way. And the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So he also spoke to the men of Penuel, saying, &#8220;When I come back in peace, I will tear down this tower!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Now Zebah and Zalmunna <i>were</i> at Karkor, and their armies with them, about fifteen thousand, all who were left of all the army of the people of the East; for one hundred and twenty thousand men who drew the sword had fallen. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then Gideon went up by the road of those who dwell in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah; and he <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>attacked the army while the camp felt secure. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>When Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued them; and he took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and routed the whole army.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle, from the Ascent of Heres. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And he caught a young man of the men of Succoth and interrogated him; and he wrote down for him the leaders of Succoth and its elders, seventy-seven men. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then he came to the men of Succoth and said, &#8220;Here are Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you ridiculed me, saying, &#8216;<i>Are</i> the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to your weary men?&#8217; &#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>taught the men of Succoth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then he tore down the tower of Penuel and killed the men of the city.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, &#8220;What kind of men <i>were they</i> whom you killed at Tabor?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-8-18">So they answered, &#8220;As you <i>are,</i> so <i>were</i> they; each one resembled the son of a king.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then he said, &#8220;They <i>were</i> my brothers, the sons of my mother. <i>As</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> lives, if you had let them live, I would not kill you.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And he said to Jether his firstborn, &#8220;Rise, kill them!&#8221; But the youth would not draw his sword; for he was afraid, because he <i>was</i> still a youth.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>So Zebah and Zalmunna said, &#8220;Rise yourself, and kill us; for as a man <i>is, so is</i> his strength.&#8221; So Gideon arose and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescent ornaments that <i>were</i> on their camels&#8217; necks.</span></p> <h3>
Gideon&#8217;s Ephod</span></h3><p><span class="text Judg-8-22"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, &#8220;Rule over us, both you and your son, and your grandson also; for you have delivered us from the hand of Midian.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>But Gideon said to them, &#8220;I will not rule over you, nor shall my son rule over you; the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> shall rule over you.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then Gideon said to them, &#8220;I would like to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>make a request of you, that each of you would give me the earrings from his plunder.&#8221; For they had golden earrings, because they <i>were</i> Ishmaelites.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>So they answered, &#8220;We will gladly give <i>them.</i>&#8221; And they spread out a garment, and each man threw into it the earrings from his plunder. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Now the weight of the gold earrings that he requested was one thousand seven hundred <i>shekels</i> of gold, besides the crescent ornaments, pendants, and purple robes which <i>were</i> on the kings of Midian, and besides the chains that <i>were</i> around their camels&#8217; necks. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Then Gideon made it into an ephod and set it up in his city, Ophrah. And all Israel played the harlot with it there. It became a snare to Gideon and to his house.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Thus Midian was subdued before the children of Israel, so that they lifted their heads no more. And the country was quiet for forty years in the days of Gideon.</span></p> <h3>
Death of Gideon</span></h3><p><span class="text Judg-8-29"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Then Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Gideon had seventy sons who were his own offspring, for he had many wives. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>And his concubine who <i>was</i> in Shechem also bore him a son, whose name he called Abimelech. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Now Gideon the son of Joash died at a good old age, and was buried in the tomb of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>So it was, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel again played the harlot with the Baals, and made Baal-Berith their god. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Thus the children of Israel did not remember the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> their God, who had delivered them from the hands of all their enemies on every side; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>nor did they show kindness to the house of Jerubbaal (Gideon) in accordance with the good he had done for Israel.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-6722a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 8:2">Judges 8:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Few grapes left after the harvest</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6722b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 8:2">Judges 8:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'>The whole harvest</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6726c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 8:6">Judges 8:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Is the palm</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6731d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 8:11">Judges 8:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>struck</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6736e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 8:16">Judges 8:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>disciplined</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6744f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 8:24">Judges 8:24</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>request a request</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
