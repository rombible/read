And he said, &#8220;Let me go in to my wife, into <i>her</i> room.&#8221; But her father would not permit him to go in.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/15-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Her father said, &#8220;I really thought that you thoroughly hated her; therefore I gave her to your companion. <i>Is</i> not her younger sister better than she? Please, take her instead.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/15-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And Samson said to them, &#8220;This time I shall be blameless regarding the Philistines if I harm them!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/15-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then Samson went and caught three hundred foxes; and he took torches, turned <i>the foxes</i> tail to tail, and put a torch between each pair of tails. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/15-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>When he had set the torches on fire, he let <i>the foxes</i> go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and burned up both the shocks and the standing grain, as well as the vineyards <i>and</i> olive groves.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/15-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then the Philistines said, &#8220;Who has done this?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-15-6">And they answered, &#8220;Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he has taken his wife and given her to his companion.&#8221; So the Philistines came up and burned her and her father with fire.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/15-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Samson said to them, &#8220;Since you would do a thing like this, I will surely take revenge on you, and after that I will cease.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/15-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So he attacked them hip and thigh with a great slaughter; then he went down and dwelt in the cleft of the rock of Etam.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/15-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Now the Philistines went up, encamped in Judah, and deployed themselves against Lehi. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/15-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And the men of Judah said, &#8220;Why have you come up against us?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-15-10">So they answered, &#8220;We have come up to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>arrest Samson, to do to him as he has done to us.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/15-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson, &#8220;Do you not know that the Philistines rule over us? What <i>is</i> this you have done to us?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-15-11">And he said to them, &#8220;As they did to me, so I have done to them.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/15-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But they said to him, &#8220;We have come down to arrest you, that we may deliver you into the hand of the Philistines.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-15-12">Then Samson said to them, &#8220;Swear to me that you will not kill me yourselves.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/15-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So they spoke to him, saying, &#8220;No, but we will tie you securely and deliver you into their hand; but we will surely not kill you.&#8221; And they bound him with two new ropes and brought him up from the rock.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/15-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>When he came to Lehi, the Philistines came shouting against him. Then the Spirit of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came mightily upon him; and the ropes that <i>were</i> on his arms became like flax that is burned with fire, and his bonds <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>broke loose from his hands. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/15-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>He found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, reached out his hand and took it, and killed a thousand men with it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/15-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then Samson said:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Judg-15-16">&#8220;With the jawbone of a donkey,</span><br /><span class="text Judg-15-16">Heaps upon heaps,</span><br /><span class="text Judg-15-16">With the jawbone of a donkey</span><br /><span class="text Judg-15-16">I have slain a thousand men!&#8221;</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/15-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And so it was, when he had finished speaking, that he threw the jawbone from his hand, and called that place <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Ramath Lehi.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/15-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then he became very thirsty; so he cried out to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and said, &#8220;You have given this great deliverance by the hand of Your servant; and now shall I die of thirst and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/15-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>So God split the hollow place that <i>is</i> in <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>Lehi, and water came out, and he drank; and his spirit returned, and he revived. Therefore he called its name <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>En Hakkore, which is in Lehi to this day. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/15-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And he judged Israel twenty years in the days of the Philistines.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-6940a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 15:10">Judges 15:10</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>bind</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6944b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 15:14">Judges 15:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>were melted</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6947c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 15:17">Judges 15:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Jawbone Height</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6949d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 15:19">Judges 15:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Jawbone,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Judg.15.14" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=Judg.15.14&amp;version=NKJV">Judg. 15:14</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6949e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 15:19">Judges 15:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Spring of the Caller</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
