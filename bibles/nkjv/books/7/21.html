<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/21-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then the people came to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>the house of God, and remained there before God till evening. They lifted up their voices and wept bitterly, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/21-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and said, &#8220;O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel, why has this come to pass in Israel, that today there should be one tribe <i>missing</i> in Israel?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/21-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So it was, on the next morning, that the people rose early and built an altar there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/21-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>The children of Israel said, &#8220;Who <i>is there</i> among all the tribes of Israel who did not come up with the assembly to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>?&#8221; For they had made a great oath concerning anyone who had not come up to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> at Mizpah, saying, &#8220;He shall surely be put to death.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/21-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And the children of Israel grieved for Benjamin their brother, and said, &#8220;One tribe is cut off from Israel today. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/21-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>What shall we do for wives for those who remain, seeing we have sworn by the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> that we will not give them our daughters as wives?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/21-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And they said, &#8220;What one <i>is there</i> from the tribes of Israel who did not come up to Mizpah to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>?&#8221; And, in fact, no one had come to the camp from Jabesh Gilead to the assembly. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/21-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For when the people were counted, indeed, not one of the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead <i>was</i> there. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/21-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So the congregation sent out there twelve thousand of their most valiant men, and commanded them, saying, &#8220;Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead with the edge of the sword, including the women and children. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/21-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And this <i>is</i> the thing that you shall do: You shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman who has known a man intimately.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/21-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred young virgins who had not known a man intimately; and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/21-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then the whole congregation sent <i>word</i> to the children of Benjamin who <i>were</i> at the rock of Rimmon, and announced peace to them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/21-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So Benjamin came back at that time, and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh Gilead; and yet they had not found enough for them.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/21-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And the people grieved for Benjamin, because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had made a void in the tribes of Israel.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/21-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then the elders of the congregation said, &#8220;What shall we do for wives for those who remain, since the women of Benjamin have been destroyed?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/21-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And they said, &#8220;<i>There must be</i> an inheritance for the survivors of Benjamin, that a tribe may not be destroyed from Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/21-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>However, we cannot give them wives from our daughters, for the children of Israel have sworn an oath, saying, &#8216;Cursed <i>be</i> the one who gives a wife to Benjamin.&#8217; &#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/21-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then they said, &#8220;In fact, <i>there is</i> a yearly feast of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> in Shiloh, which <i>is</i> north of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/21-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Therefore they instructed the children of Benjamin, saying, &#8220;Go, lie in wait in the vineyards, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/21-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>and watch; and just when the daughters of Shiloh come out to perform their dances, then come out from the vineyards, and every man catch a wife for himself from the daughters of Shiloh; then go to the land of Benjamin. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/21-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then it shall be, when their fathers or their brothers come to us to complain, that we will say to them, &#8216;Be kind to them for our sakes, because we did not take a wife for any of them in the war; for <i>it is</i> not <i>as though</i> you have given the <i>women</i> to them at this time, making yourselves guilty of your oath.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/21-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And the children of Benjamin did so; they took enough wives for their number from those who danced, whom they caught. Then they went and returned to their inheritance, and they rebuilt the cities and dwelt in them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/21-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>So the children of Israel departed from there at that time, every man to his tribe and family; they went out from there, every man to his inheritance.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/21-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>In those days <i>there was</i> no king in Israel; everyone did <i>what was</i> right in his own eyes.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-7105a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 21:2">Judges 21:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>Bethel</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
