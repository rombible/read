<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/16-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span><i>When</i> the Gazites <i>were told,</i> &#8220;Samson has come here!&#8221; they surrounded <i>the place</i> and lay in wait for him all night at the gate of the city. They were quiet all night, saying, &#8220;In the morning, when it is daylight, we will kill him.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/16-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And Samson lay <i>low</i> till midnight; then he arose at midnight, took hold of the doors of the gate of the city and the two gateposts, pulled them up, bar and all, put <i>them</i> on his shoulders, and carried them to the top of the hill that faces Hebron.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/16-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Afterward it happened that he loved a woman in the Valley of Sorek, whose name <i>was</i> Delilah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/16-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And the lords of the Philistines came up to her and said to her, &#8220;Entice him, and find out where his great strength <i>lies,</i> and by what <i>means</i> we may overpower him, that we may bind him to afflict him; and every one of us will give you eleven hundred <i>pieces</i> of silver.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/16-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So Delilah said to Samson, &#8220;Please tell me where your great strength <i>lies,</i> and with what you may be bound to afflict you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/16-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And Samson said to her, &#8220;If they bind me with seven fresh bowstrings, not yet dried, then I shall become weak, and be like any <i>other</i> man.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/16-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven fresh bowstrings, not yet dried, and she bound him with them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/16-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Now <i>men were</i> lying in wait, staying with her in the room. And she said to him, &#8220;The Philistines <i>are</i> upon you, Samson!&#8221; But he broke the bowstrings as a strand of yarn breaks when it touches fire. So the secret of his strength was not known.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/16-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then Delilah said to Samson, &#8220;Look, you have mocked me and told me lies. Now, please tell me what you may be bound with.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/16-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So he said to her, &#8220;If they bind me securely with new ropes <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>that have never been used, then I shall become weak, and be like any <i>other</i> man.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/16-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Therefore Delilah took new ropes and bound him with them, and said to him, &#8220;The Philistines <i>are</i> upon you, Samson!&#8221; And <i>men were</i> lying in wait, staying in the room. But he broke them off his arms like a thread.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/16-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Delilah said to Samson, &#8220;Until now you have mocked me and told me lies. Tell me what you may be bound with.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-16-13">And he said to her, &#8220;If you weave the seven locks of my head into the web of the loom&#8221;&#8212;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/16-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So she wove <i>it</i> tightly with the batten of the loom, and said to him, &#8220;The Philistines <i>are</i> upon you, Samson!&#8221; But he awoke from his sleep, and pulled out the batten and the web from the loom.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/16-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then she said to him, &#8220;How can you say, &#8216;I love you,&#8217; when your heart <i>is</i> not with me? You have mocked me these three times, and have not told me where your great strength <i>lies.</i>&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/16-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And it came to pass, when she pestered him daily with her words and pressed him, <i>so</i> that his soul was <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>vexed to death, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/16-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>that he told her all his heart, and said to her, &#8220;No razor has ever come upon my head, for I <i>have been</i> a Nazirite to God from my mother&#8217;s womb. If I am shaven, then my strength will leave me, and I shall become weak, and be like any <i>other</i> man.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/16-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>When Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, &#8220;Come up once more, for he has told me all his heart.&#8221; So the lords of the Philistines came up to her and brought the money in their hand. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/16-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then she lulled him to sleep on her knees, and called for a man and had him shave off the seven locks of his head. Then <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>she began to torment him, and his strength left him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/16-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And she said, &#8220;The Philistines <i>are</i> upon you, Samson!&#8221; So he awoke from his sleep, and said, &#8220;I will go out as before, at other times, and shake myself free!&#8221; But he did not know that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had departed from him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/16-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then the Philistines took him and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza. They bound him with bronze fetters, and he became a grinder in the prison. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/16-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>However, the hair of his head began to grow again after it had been shaven.</span></p> <h3>
Samson Dies with the Philistines</span></h3><p><span class="text Judg-16-23"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/16-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Now the lords of the Philistines gathered together to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to rejoice. And they said:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Judg-16-23">&#8220;Our god has delivered into our hands</span><br /><span class="text Judg-16-23">Samson our enemy!&#8221;</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/16-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>When the people saw him, they praised their god; for they said:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Judg-16-24">&#8220;Our god has delivered into our hands our enemy,</span><br /><span class="text Judg-16-24">The destroyer of our land,</span><br /><span class="text Judg-16-24">And the one who multiplied our dead.&#8221;</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/16-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>So it happened, when their hearts were merry, that they said, &#8220;Call for Samson, that he may perform for us.&#8221; So they called for Samson from the prison, and he performed for them. And they stationed him between the pillars. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/16-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Then Samson said to the lad who held him by the hand, &#8220;Let me feel the pillars which support the temple, so that I can lean on them.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/16-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Now the temple was full of men and women. All the lords of the Philistines <i>were</i> there&#8212;about three thousand men and women on the roof watching while Samson performed.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/16-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then Samson called to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, saying, &#8220;O Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>, remember me, I pray! Strengthen me, I pray, just this once, O God, that I may with one <i>blow</i> take vengeance on the Philistines for my two eyes!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/16-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars which supported the temple, and he braced himself against them, one on his right and the other on his left. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/16-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Then Samson said, &#8220;Let me die with the Philistines!&#8221; And he pushed with <i>all his</i> might, and the temple fell on the lords and all the people who <i>were</i> in it. So the dead that he killed at his death were more than he had killed in his life.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/16-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>And his brothers and all his father&#8217;s household came down and took him, and brought <i>him</i> up and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of his father Manoah. He had judged Israel twenty years.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-6961a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 16:11">Judges 16:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>with which work has never been done</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6966b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 16:16">Judges 16:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>impatient to the point of</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6969c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 16:19">Judges 16:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'>So with MT, Tg., Vg.; LXX <i>he began to be weak,</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6971d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 16:21">Judges 16:21</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>bored out</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
