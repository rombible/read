<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said, &#8220;Judah shall go up. Indeed I have delivered the land into his hand.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So Judah said to Simeon his brother, &#8220;Come up with me to my allotted territory, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I will likewise go with you to your allotted territory.&#8221; And Simeon went with him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then Judah went up, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand; and they killed ten thousand men at Bezek. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And they found Adoni-Bezek in Bezek, and fought against him; and they defeated the Canaanites and the Perizzites. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then Adoni-Bezek fled, and they pursued him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and big toes. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And Adoni-Bezek said, &#8220;Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off used to gather <i>scraps</i> under my table; as I have done, so God has repaid me.&#8221; Then they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Now the children of Judah fought against Jerusalem and took it; they struck it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who dwelt in the mountains, in the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>South, and in the lowland. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then Judah <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>went against the Canaanites who dwelt in Hebron. (Now the name of Hebron <i>was</i> formerly Kirjath Arba.) And they killed Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>From there they went against the inhabitants of Debir. (The name of Debir <i>was</i> formerly Kirjath Sepher.)</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then Caleb said, &#8220;Whoever attacks Kirjath Sepher and takes it, to him I will give my daughter Achsah as wife.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb&#8217;s younger brother, took it; so he gave him his daughter Achsah as wife. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Now it happened, when she came <i>to him,</i> that <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>she urged him to ask her father for a field. And she dismounted from <i>her</i> donkey, and Caleb said to her, &#8220;What do you wish?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So she said to him, &#8220;Give me a blessing; since you have given me land in the South, give me also springs of water.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-1-15">And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Now the children of the Kenite, Moses&#8217; father-in-law, went up from the City of Palms with the children of Judah into the Wilderness of Judah, which <i>lies</i> in the South <i>near</i> Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And Judah went with his brother Simeon, and they attacked the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. So the name of the city was called Hormah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Also Judah took Gaza with its territory, Ashkelon with its territory, and Ekron with its territory. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was with Judah. And they drove out the mountaineers, but they could not drive out the inhabitants of the lowland, because they had chariots of iron. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had said. Then he <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>expelled from there the three sons of Anak. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>But the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem; so the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>house of Joseph also went up against Bethel, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>was</i> with them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>So the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>house of Joseph sent men to spy out Bethel. (The name of the city <i>was</i> formerly Luz.) </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And when the spies saw a man coming out of the city, they said to him, &#8220;Please show us the entrance to the city, and we will show you mercy.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>So he showed them the entrance to the city, and they struck the city with the edge of the sword; but they let the man and all his family go. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And the man went to the land of the Hittites, built a city, and called its name Luz, which <i>is</i> its name to this day.</span></p> <h3>
Incomplete Conquest of the Land</span></h3><p><span class="text Judg-1-27"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>However, Manasseh did not drive out <i>the inhabitants of</i> Beth Shean and its villages, or Taanach and its villages, or the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its villages, or the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages; for the Canaanites were determined to dwell in that land. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>under tribute, but did not completely drive them out.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Nor did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites who dwelt in Gezer; so the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Nor did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron or the inhabitants of Nahalol; so the Canaanites dwelt among them, and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>were put under tribute.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Nor did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Acco or the inhabitants of Sidon, or of Ahlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphik, or Rehob. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>So the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; for they did not drive them out.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Nor did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh or the inhabitants of Beth Anath; but they dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land. Nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh and Beth Anath were put under tribute to them.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountains, for they would not allow them to come down to the valley; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>and the Amorites were determined to dwell in Mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>Shaalbim; yet when the strength of the house of Joseph became greater, they <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>were put under tribute.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Now the boundary of the Amorites <i>was</i> from the Ascent of Akrabbim, from Sela, and upward.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-6519a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 1:9">Judges 1:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. <i>Negev,</i> and so throughout the book</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6520b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 1:10">Judges 1:10</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>attacked</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6524c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 1:14">Judges 1:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'>LXX, Vg. <i>he urged her</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6530d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 1:20">Judges 1:20</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>drove out from there</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6532e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 1:22">Judges 1:22</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>family</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6533f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 1:23">Judges 1:23</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>family</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6538g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 1:28">Judges 1:28</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>to forced labor</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6540h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 1:30">Judges 1:30</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>became forced laborers</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6545i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 1:35">Judges 1:35</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Shaalabbin,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Josh.19.42" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=Josh.19.42&amp;version=NKJV">Josh. 19:42</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6545j"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 1:35">Judges 1:35</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>became forced laborers</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
