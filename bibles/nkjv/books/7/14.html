<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/14-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So he went up and told his father and mother, saying, &#8220;I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines; now therefore, get her for me as a wife.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/14-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then his father and mother said to him, &#8220;<i>Is there</i> no woman among the daughters of your brethren, or among all my people, that you must go and get a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-14-3">And Samson said to his father, &#8220;Get her for me, for <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>she pleases me well.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/14-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But his father and mother did not know that it was of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8212;that He was seeking an occasion to move against the Philistines. For at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/14-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So Samson went down to Timnah with his father and mother, and came to the vineyards of Timnah.</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-14-5">Now <i>to his</i> surprise, a young lion <i>came</i> roaring against him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/14-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And the Spirit of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came mightily upon him, and he tore the lion apart as one would have torn apart a young goat, though <i>he had</i> nothing in his hand. But he did not tell his father or his mother what he had done.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/14-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then he went down and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/14-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>After some time, when he returned to get her, he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion. And behold, a swarm of bees and honey <i>were</i> in the carcass of the lion. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/14-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>He took some of it in his hands and went along, eating. When he came to his father and mother, he gave <i>some</i> to them, and they also ate. But he did not tell them that he had taken the honey out of the carcass of the lion.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/14-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So his father went down to the woman. And Samson gave a feast there, for young men used to do so. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/14-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And it happened, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/14-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then Samson said to them, &#8220;Let me pose a riddle to you. If you can correctly solve and explain it to me within the seven days of the feast, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/14-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>But if you cannot explain <i>it</i> to me, then you shall give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-14-13">And they said to him, &#8220;Pose your riddle, that we may hear it.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/14-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So he said to them:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Judg-14-14">&#8220;Out of the eater came something to eat,</span><br /><span class="text Judg-14-14">And out of the strong came something sweet.&#8221;</span></p></div><p class="first-line-none top-1"><span class="text Judg-14-14">Now for three days they could not explain the riddle.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/14-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But it came to pass on the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>seventh day that they said to Samson&#8217;s wife, &#8220;Entice your husband, that he may explain the riddle to us, or else we will burn you and your father&#8217;s house with fire. Have you invited us in order to take what is ours? <i>Is that</i> not <i>so?</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/14-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then Samson&#8217;s wife wept on him, and said, &#8220;You only hate me! You do not love me! You have posed a riddle to the sons of my people, but you have not explained <i>it</i> to me.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Judg-14-16">And he said to her, &#8220;Look, I have not explained <i>it</i> to my father or my mother; so should I explain <i>it</i> to you?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/14-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Now she had wept on him the seven days while their feast lasted. And it happened on the seventh day that he told her, because she pressed him so much. Then she explained the riddle to the sons of her people. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/14-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>So the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Judg-14-18">&#8220;What <i>is</i> sweeter than honey?</span><br /><span class="text Judg-14-18">And what <i>is</i> stronger than a lion?&#8221;</span></p></div><p class="first-line-none top-1"><span class="text Judg-14-18">And he said to them:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Judg-14-18">&#8220;If you had not plowed with my heifer,</span><br /><span class="text Judg-14-18">You would not have solved my riddle!&#8221;</span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/14-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then the Spirit of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came upon him mightily, and he went down to Ashkelon and killed thirty of their men, took their apparel, and gave the changes <i>of clothing</i> to those who had explained the riddle. So his anger was aroused, and he went back up to his father&#8217;s house. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/14-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And Samson&#8217;s wife was <i>given</i> to his companion, who had been his best man.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-6913a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 14:3">Judges 14:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>she is right in my eyes</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-6925b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Judges 14:15">Judges 14:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'>So with MT, Tg., Vg.; LXX, Syr. <i>fourth</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
