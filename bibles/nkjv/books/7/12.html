We will burn your house down on you with fire!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/12-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Jephthah said to them, &#8220;My people and I were in a great struggle with the people of Ammon; and when I called you, you did not deliver me out of their hands. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/12-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So when I saw that you would not deliver <i>me,</i> I took my life in my hands and crossed over against the people of Ammon; and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> delivered them into my hand. Why then have you come up to me this day to fight against me?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/12-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Now Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead and fought against Ephraim. And the men of Gilead defeated Ephraim, because they said, &#8220;You Gileadites <i>are</i> fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites <i>and</i> among the Manassites.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/12-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>The Gileadites seized the fords of the Jordan before the Ephraimites <i>arrived.</i> And when <i>any</i> Ephraimite who escaped said, &#8220;Let me cross over,&#8221; the men of Gilead would say to him, &#8220;<i>Are</i> you an Ephraimite?&#8221; If he said, &#8220;No,&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/12-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>then they would say to him, &#8220;Then say, &#8216;Shibboleth&#8217;!&#8221;<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span> And he would say, &#8220;Sibboleth,&#8221; for he could not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>pronounce <i>it</i> right. Then they would take him and kill him at the fords of the Jordan. There fell at that time forty-two thousand Ephraimites.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/12-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died and was buried among the cities of Gilead.</span></p> <h3>
