<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Gilead&#8217;s wife bore sons; and when his wife&#8217;s sons grew up, they drove Jephthah out, and said to him, &#8220;You shall have no inheritance in our father&#8217;s house, for you <i>are</i> the son of another woman.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then Jephthah fled from his brothers and dwelt in the land of Tob; and worthless men banded together with Jephthah and went out <i>raiding</i> with him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>It came to pass after a time that the people of Ammon made war against Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And so it was, when the people of Ammon made war against Israel, that the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah from the land of Tob. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then they said to Jephthah, &#8220;Come and be our commander, that we may fight against the people of Ammon.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, &#8220;Did you not hate me, and expel me from my father&#8217;s house? Why have you come to me now when you are in <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>distress?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, &#8220;That is why we have turned<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span> again to you now, that you may go with us and fight against the people of Ammon, and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, &#8220;If you take me back home to fight against the people of Ammon, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> delivers them to me, shall I be your head?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, &#8220;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will be a witness between us, if we do not do according to your words.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and commander over them; and Jephthah spoke all his words before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> in Mizpah.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the people of Ammon, saying, &#8220;What do you have against me, that you have come to fight against me in my land?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And the king of the people of Ammon answered the messengers of Jephthah, &#8220;Because Israel took away my land when they came up out of Egypt, from the Arnon as far as the Jabbok, and to the Jordan. Now therefore, restore those <i>lands</i> peaceably.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/11-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So Jephthah again sent messengers to the king of the people of Ammon, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/11-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and said to him, &#8220;Thus says Jephthah: &#8216;Israel did not take away the land of Moab, nor the land of the people of Ammon; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/11-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>for when Israel came up from Egypt, they walked through the wilderness as far as the Red Sea and came to Kadesh. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/11-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, &#8220;Please let me pass through your land.&#8221; But the king of Edom would not heed. And in like manner they sent to the king of Moab, but he would not <i>consent.</i> So Israel remained in Kadesh. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/11-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And they went along through the wilderness and bypassed the land of Edom and the land of Moab, came to the east side of the land of Moab, and encamped on the other side of the Arnon. But they did not enter the border of Moab, for the Arnon <i>was</i> the border of Moab. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/11-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, king of Heshbon; and Israel said to him, &#8220;Please let us pass through your land into our place.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/11-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>But Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through his territory. So Sihon gathered all his people together, encamped in Jahaz, and fought against Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/11-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they defeated<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> them. Thus Israel gained possession of all the land of the Amorites, who inhabited that country. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/11-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>They took possession of all the territory of the Amorites, from the Arnon to the Jabbok and from the wilderness to the Jordan.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/11-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>&#8216;And now the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel has <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>dispossessed the Amorites from before His people Israel; should you then possess it? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/11-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Will you not possess whatever Chemosh your god gives you to possess? So whatever the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God takes possession of before us, we will possess. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/11-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And now, <i>are</i> you any better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever strive against Israel? Did he ever fight against them? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/11-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and its villages, in Aroer and its villages, and in all the cities along the banks of the Arnon, for three hundred years, why did you not recover <i>them</i> within that time? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/11-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Therefore I have not sinned against you, but you wronged me by fighting against me. May the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, the Judge, render judgment this day between the children of Israel and the people of Ammon.&#8217; &#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/11-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>However, the king of the people of Ammon did not heed the words which Jephthah sent him.</span></p> <h3>
Jephthah&#8217;s Vow and Victory</span></h3><p><span class="text Judg-11-29"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/11-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Then the Spirit of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came upon Jephthah, and he passed through Gilead and Manasseh, and passed through Mizpah of Gilead; and from Mizpah of Gilead he advanced <i>toward</i> the people of Ammon. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/11-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And Jephthah made a vow to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and said, &#8220;If You will indeed deliver the people of Ammon into my hands, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/11-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>then it will be that whatever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the people of Ammon, shall surely be the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s, and I will offer it up as a burnt offering.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/11-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>So Jephthah advanced toward the people of Ammon to fight against them, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> delivered them into his hands. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/11-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And he <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>defeated them from Aroer as far as Minnith&#8212;twenty cities&#8212;and to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>Abel Keramim, with a very great slaughter. Thus the people of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.</span></p> <h3>
Jephthah&#8217;s Daughter</span></h3><p><span class="text Judg-11-34"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/11-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>When Jephthah came to his house at Mizpah, there was his daughter, coming out to meet him with timbrels and dancing; and she <i>was his</i> only child. Besides her he had neither son nor daughter. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/11-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he tore his clothes, and said, &#8220;Alas, my daughter! You have brought me very low! You are among those who trouble me! For I have <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>given my word to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and I cannot <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>go back on it.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/11-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>So she said to him, &#8220;My father, <i>if</i> you have given your word to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, do to me according to what has gone out of your mouth, because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has avenged you of your enemies, the people of Ammon.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/11-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>Then she said to her father, &#8220;Let this thing be done for me: let me alone for two months, that I may go and wander on the mountains and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>bewail my virginity, my <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>friends and I.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/11-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>So he said, &#8220;Go.&#8221; And he sent her away <i>for</i> two months; and she went with her friends, and bewailed her virginity on the mountains. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/11-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>And it was so at the end of two months that she returned to her father, and he carried out his vow with her which he had vowed.
