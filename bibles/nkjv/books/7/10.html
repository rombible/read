<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>He judged Israel twenty-three years; and he died and was buried in Shamir.</span></p> <h3>
Jair</span></h3><p><span class="text Judg-10-3"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>After him arose Jair, a Gileadite; and he judged Israel twenty-two years. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Now he had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkeys; they also had thirty towns, which are called <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>&#8220;Havoth Jair&#8221; to this day, which <i>are</i> in the land of Gilead. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And Jair died and was buried in Camon.</span></p> <h3>
Israel Oppressed Again</span></h3><p><span class="text Judg-10-6"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and served the Baals and the Ashtoreths, the gods of Syria, the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the people of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines; and they forsook the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and did not serve Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So the anger of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was hot against Israel; and He sold them into the hands of the Philistines and into the hands of the people of Ammon. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/10-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>From that year they <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>harassed and oppressed the children of Israel for eighteen years&#8212;all the children of Israel who <i>were</i> on the other side of the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, in Gilead. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Moreover the people of Ammon crossed over the Jordan to fight against Judah also, against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim, so that Israel was severely distressed.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And the children of Israel cried out to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, saying, &#8220;We have sinned against You, because we have both forsaken our God and served the Baals!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/10-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to the children of Israel, &#8220;<i>Did I</i> not <i>deliver you</i> from the Egyptians and from the Amorites and from the people of Ammon and from the Philistines? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/10-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Also the Sidonians and Amalekites and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Maonites oppressed you; and you cried out to Me, and I delivered you from their hand. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/10-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Yet you have forsaken Me and served other gods. Therefore I will deliver you no more. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/10-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>&#8220;Go and cry out to the gods which you have chosen; let them deliver you in your time of distress.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/10-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And the children of Israel said to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, &#8220;We have sinned!

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/10-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So they put away the foreign gods from among them and served the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/10-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then the people of Ammon gathered together and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled together and encamped in Mizpah. </span>
