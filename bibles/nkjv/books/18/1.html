<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And seven sons and three daughters were born to him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Also, his possessions were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a very large household, so that this man was the greatest of all the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>people of the East.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And his sons would go and feast <i>in their</i> houses, each on his <i>appointed</i> day, and would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So it was, when the days of feasting had run their course, that Job would send and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>sanctify them, and he would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings <i>according to</i> the number of them all. For Job said, &#8220;It may be that my sons have sinned and cursed<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span> God in their hearts.&#8221; Thus Job did regularly.</span></p> <h3>
Satan Attacks Job&#8217;s Character</span></h3><p><span class="text Job-1-6"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>Satan also came among them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>Satan, &#8220;From where do you come?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Job-1-7">So Satan answered the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and said, &#8220;From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking back and forth on it.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Satan, &#8220;Have you <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>considered My servant Job, that <i>there is</i> none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>shuns evil?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So Satan answered the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and said, &#8220;Does Job fear God for nothing? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Have You not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>made a hedge around him, around his household, and around all that he has on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But now, stretch out Your hand and touch all that he has, and he will surely curse<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span> You to Your face!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Satan, &#8220;Behold, all that he has <i>is</i> in your <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span>power; only do not lay a hand on his <i>person.</i>&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Job-1-12">So Satan went out from the presence of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.</span></p> <h3>
Job Loses His Property and Children</span></h3><p><span class="text Job-1-13"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Now there was a day when his sons and daughters <i>were</i> eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother&#8217;s house; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>and a messenger came to Job and said, &#8220;The oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>when the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[l]</a></span>Sabeans <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[m]</a></span>raided <i>them</i> and took them away&#8212;indeed they have killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>While he <i>was</i> still speaking, another also came and said, &#8220;The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants, and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[n]</a></span>consumed them; and I alone have escaped to tell you!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>While he <i>was</i> still speaking, another also came and said, &#8220;The Chaldeans formed three bands, raided the camels and took them away, yes, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>While he <i>was</i> still speaking, another also came and said, &#8220;Your sons and daughters <i>were</i> eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother&#8217;s house, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>and suddenly a great wind came from <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[o]</a></span>across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young people, and they are dead; and I alone have escaped to tell you!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then Job arose, tore his robe, and shaved his head; and he fell to the ground and worshiped. </span>
