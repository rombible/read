<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Satan, &#8220;From where do you come?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Job-2-2">Satan answered the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and said, &#8220;From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking back and forth on it.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Satan, &#8220;Have you considered My servant Job, that <i>there is</i> none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil? And still he holds fast to his integrity, although you incited Me against him, to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>destroy him without cause.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So Satan answered the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and said, &#8220;Skin for skin! Yes, all that a man has he will give for his life. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But stretch out Your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will surely <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>curse You to Your face!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Satan, &#8220;Behold, he <i>is</i> in your hand, but spare his life.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So Satan went out from the presence of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and struck Job with painful boils from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And he took for himself a potsherd with which to scrape himself while he sat in the midst of the ashes.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then his wife said to him, &#8220;Do you still hold fast to your integrity? <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Curse God and die!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>But he said to her, &#8220;You speak as one of the foolish women speaks. Shall we indeed accept good from God, and shall we not accept adversity?&#8221; In all this Job did not sin with his lips.</span></p> <h3>
Job&#8217;s Three Friends</span></h3><p><span class="text Job-2-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now when Job&#8217;s three friends heard of all this adversity that had come upon him, each one came from his own place&#8212;Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. For they had made an appointment together to come and mourn with him, and to comfort him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And when they raised their eyes from afar, and did not recognize him, they lifted their voices and wept; and each one tore his robe and sprinkled dust on his head toward heaven. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that <i>his</i> grief was very great.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-12895a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Job 2:3">Job 2:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>consume</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12897b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Job 2:5">Job 2:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>bless,</i> but in an evil sense; cf. <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Job.1.5" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=Job.1.5&amp;version=NKJV">Job 1:5</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12901c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Job 2:9">Job 2:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Bless,</i> but in an evil sense; cf. <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Job.1.5" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=Job.1.5&amp;version=NKJV">Job 1:5</span></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
