<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/42-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;I know that You can do everything,</span><br /><span class="text Job-42-2">And that no purpose <i>of Yours</i> can be withheld from You.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/42-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span><i>You asked,</i> &#8216;Who <i>is</i> this who hides counsel without knowledge?&#8217;</span><br /><span class="text Job-42-3">Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand,</span><br /><span class="text Job-42-3">Things too wonderful for me, which I did not know.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/42-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Listen, please, and let me speak;</span><br /><span class="text Job-42-4"><i>You said,</i> &#8216;I will question you, and you shall answer Me.&#8217;</span></p></div> <div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/42-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8220;I have heard of You by the hearing of the ear,</span><br /><span class="text Job-42-5">But now my eye sees You.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/42-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Therefore I abhor<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span> <i>myself,</i></span><br /><span class="text Job-42-6">And repent in dust and ashes.&#8221;</span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/42-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And so it was, after the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had spoken these words to Job, that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Eliphaz the Temanite, &#8220;My wrath is aroused against you and your two friends, for you have not spoken of Me <i>what is</i> right, as My servant Job <i>has.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/42-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Now therefore, take for yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, go to My servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and My servant Job shall pray for you. For I will accept <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>him, lest I deal with you <i>according to your</i> folly; because you have not spoken of Me <i>what is</i> right, as My servant Job <i>has.</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/42-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite <i>and</i> Zophar the Naamathite went and did as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> commanded them; for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>accepted Job. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/42-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>restored Job&#8217;s losses when he prayed for his friends. Indeed the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> gave Job twice as much as he had before. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/42-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then all his brothers, all his sisters, and all those who had been his acquaintances before, came to him and ate food with him in his house; and they consoled him and comforted him for all the adversity that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had brought upon him. Each one gave him a piece of silver and each a ring of gold.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/42-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> blessed the latter <i>days</i> of Job more than his beginning; for he had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, one thousand yoke of oxen, and one thousand female donkeys. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/42-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>He also had seven sons and three daughters. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/42-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And he called the name of the first <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>Jemimah, the name of the second <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>Keziah, and the name of the third <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>Keren-Happuch. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/42-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>In all the land were found no women <i>so</i> beautiful as the daughters of Job; and their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/42-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>After this Job lived one hundred and forty years, and saw his children and grandchildren <i>for</i> four generations. </span>
