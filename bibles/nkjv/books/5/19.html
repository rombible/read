<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>you shall separate three cities for yourself in the midst of your land which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God is giving you to possess. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>You shall prepare roads for yourself, and divide into three parts the territory of your land which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God is giving you to inherit, that any manslayer may flee there.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8220;And this <i>is</i> the case of the manslayer who flees there, that he may live: Whoever kills his neighbor <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>unintentionally, not having hated him in time past&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>as when <i>a man</i> goes to the woods with his neighbor to cut timber, and his hand swings a stroke with the ax to cut down the tree, and the head slips from the handle and strikes his neighbor so that he dies&#8212;he shall flee to one of these cities and live; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>lest the avenger of blood, while his anger is hot, pursue the manslayer and overtake him, because the way is long, and kill him, though he <i>was</i> not deserving of death, since he had not hated the victim in time past. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Therefore I command you, saying, &#8216;You shall separate three cities for yourself.&#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8220;Now if the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God enlarges your territory, as He swore to your fathers, and gives you the land which He promised to give to your fathers, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and if you keep all these commandments and do them, which I command you today, to love the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God and to walk always in His ways, then you shall add three more cities for yourself besides these three, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>lest innocent blood be shed in the midst of your land which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God is giving you <i>as</i> an inheritance, and <i>thus</i> guilt of bloodshed be upon you.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8220;But if anyone hates his neighbor, lies in wait for him, rises against him and strikes him mortally, so that he dies, and he flees to one of these cities, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>then the elders of his city shall send and bring him from there, and deliver him over to the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Your eye shall not pity him, but you shall <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>put away <i>the guilt of</i> innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with you.</span></p> <h3>
Property Boundaries</span></h3><p><span class="text Deut-19-14"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>&#8220;You shall not remove your neighbor&#8217;s landmark, which the men of old have set, in your inheritance which you will inherit in the land that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God is giving you to possess.</span></p> <h3>
The Law Concerning Witnesses</span></h3><p><span class="text Deut-19-15"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>&#8220;One witness shall not rise against a man concerning any iniquity or any sin that he commits; by the mouth of two or three witnesses the matter shall be established. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>If a false witness rises against any man to testify against him of wrongdoing, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>then both men in the controversy shall stand before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, before the priests and the judges who serve in those days. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And the judges shall make careful inquiry, and indeed, <i>if</i> the witness <i>is</i> a false witness, who has testified falsely against his brother, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>then you shall do to him as he thought to have done to his brother; so you shall put away the evil from among you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And those who remain shall hear and fear, and hereafter they shall not again commit such evil among you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Your eye shall not pity: life <i>shall be</i> for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-5411a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Deuteronomy 19:4">Deuteronomy 19:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>ignorantly,</i> lit. <i>without knowledge</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-5420b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Deuteronomy 19:13">Deuteronomy 19:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>purge the blood of the innocent</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
