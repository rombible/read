<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Your eyes have seen what the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> did at Baal Peor; for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God has destroyed from among you all the men who followed Baal of Peor. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But you who held fast to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God <i>are</i> alive today, every one of you.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8220;Surely I have taught you statutes and judgments, just as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> my God commanded me, that you should act according <i>to them</i> in the land which you go to possess. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Therefore be careful to observe <i>them;</i> for this <i>is</i> your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples who will hear all these statutes, and say, &#8216;Surely this great nation <i>is</i> a wise and understanding people.&#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8220;For what great nation <i>is there</i> that has God<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span> <i>so</i> near to it, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God <i>is</i> to us, for whatever <i>reason</i> we may call upon Him? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And what great nation <i>is there</i> that has <i>such</i> statutes and righteous judgments as are in all this law which I set before you this day? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Only take heed to yourself, and diligently keep yourself, lest you forget the things your eyes have seen, and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life. And teach them to your children and your grandchildren, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><i>especially concerning</i> the day you stood before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God in Horeb, when the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to me, &#8216;Gather the people to Me, and I will let them hear My words, that they may learn to fear Me all the days they live on the earth, and <i>that</i> they may teach their children.&#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8220;Then you came near and stood at the foot of the mountain, and the mountain burned with fire to the midst of heaven, with darkness, cloud, and thick darkness. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to you out of the midst of the fire.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So He declared to you His covenant which He commanded you to perform, the Ten Commandments; and He wrote them on two tablets of stone. </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will scatter you among the peoples, and you will be left few in number among the nations where the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will drive you. </span>
