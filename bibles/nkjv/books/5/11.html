<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Know today that <i>I do</i> not <i>speak</i> with your children, who have not known and who have not seen the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>chastening of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God, His greatness and His mighty hand and His outstretched arm&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>His signs and His acts which He did in the midst of Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to all his land; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>what He did to the army of Egypt, to their horses and their chariots: how He made the waters of the Red Sea overflow them as they pursued you, and <i>how</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has destroyed them to this day; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>what He did for you in the wilderness until you came to this place; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and what He did to Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, their households, their tents, and all the substance that <i>was</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>in their possession, in the midst of all Israel&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>but your eyes have seen every great <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>act of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> which He did.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8220;Therefore you shall keep every commandment which I command you today, that you may be strong, and go in and possess the land which you cross over to possess, </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>a land for which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God cares; the eyes of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God <i>are</i> always on it, from the beginning of the year to the very end of the year.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8216;And it shall be that if you earnestly <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>obey My commandments which I command you today, to love the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God and serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul, </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>&#8220;Therefore you shall <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>lay up these words of mine in your heart and in your soul, and bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>You shall teach them to your children, speaking of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And you shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates, </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Every place on which the sole of your foot treads shall be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the River Euphrates, even to the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>Western Sea, shall be your territory. </span>
