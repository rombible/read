<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Now Moses called all Israel and said to them: &#8220;You have seen all that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> did before your eyes in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh and to all his servants and to all his land&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>the great trials which your eyes have seen, the signs, and those great wonders. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Yet the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has not given you a heart to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>perceive and eyes to see and ears to hear, to this <i>very</i> day. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And I have led you forty years in the wilderness. Your clothes have not worn out on you, and your sandals have not worn out on your feet. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>You have not eaten bread, nor have you drunk wine or <i>similar</i> drink, that you may know that I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And when you came to this place, Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan came out against us to battle, and we conquered them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>We took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites, to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Therefore keep the words of this covenant, and do them, that you may prosper in all that you do.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8220;All of you stand today before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God: your leaders and your tribes and your elders and your officers, all the men of Israel, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>your little ones and your wives&#8212;also the stranger who <i>is</i> in your camp, from the one who cuts your wood to the one who draws your water&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>that you may enter into covenant with the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God, and into His oath, which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God makes with you today, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>that He may establish you today as a people for Himself, and <i>that</i> He may be God to you, just as He has spoken to you, and just as He has sworn to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>&#8220;I make this covenant and this oath, not with you alone, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>but with <i>him</i> who stands here with us today before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God, as well as with <i>him</i> who <i>is</i> not here with us today </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>(for you know that we dwelt in the land of Egypt and that we came through the nations which you passed by, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>and you saw their <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>abominations and their idols which <i>were</i> among them&#8212;wood and stone and silver and gold); </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>so that there may not be among you man or woman or family or tribe, whose heart turns away today from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God, to go <i>and</i> serve the gods of these nations, and that there may not be among you a root bearing bitterness or wormwood; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>and so it may not happen, when he hears the words of this curse, that he blesses himself in his heart, saying, &#8216;I shall have peace, even though I <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>follow the dictates of my heart&#8217;&#8212;as though the drunkard could be included with the sober.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>&#8220;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> would not spare him; for then the anger of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and His jealousy would burn against that man, and every curse that is written in this book would settle on him, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> would blot out his name from under heaven. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> would separate him from all the tribes of Israel for adversity, according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this Book of the Law, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>so that the coming generation of your children who rise up after you, and the foreigner who comes from a far land, would say, when they see the plagues of that land and the sicknesses which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has laid on it:</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>&#8216;The whole land <i>is</i> brimstone, salt, and burning; it is not sown, nor does it bear, nor does any grass grow there, like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> overthrew in His anger and His wrath.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>All nations would say, &#8216;Why has the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> done so to this land?

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then <i>people</i> would say: &#8216;Because they have forsaken the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of their fathers, which He made with them when He brought them out of the land of Egypt; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>for they went and served other gods and worshiped them, gods that they did not know and that He had not given to them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Then the anger of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was aroused against this land, to bring on it every curse that is written in this book. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> uprooted them from their land in anger, in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as <i>it is</i> this day.&#8217;</span></p> <p>
