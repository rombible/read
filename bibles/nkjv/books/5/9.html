<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>a people great and tall, the descendants of the Anakim, whom you know, and <i>of whom</i> you heard <i>it said,</i> &#8216;Who can stand before the descendants of Anak?&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Therefore understand today that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God <i>is</i> He who goes over before you <i>as</i> a consuming fire. He will destroy them and bring them down before you; so you shall drive them out and destroy them quickly, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has said to you.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8220;Do not think in your heart, after the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God has cast them out before you, saying, &#8216;Because of my righteousness the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has brought me in to possess this land&#8217;; but <i>it is</i> because of the wickedness of these nations <i>that</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> is driving them out from before you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span><i>It is</i> not because of your righteousness or the uprightness of your heart <i>that</i> you go in to possess their land, but because of the wickedness of these nations <i>that</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God drives them out from before you, and that He may <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>fulfill the word which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Therefore understand that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God is not giving you this good land to possess because of your righteousness, for you <i>are</i> a stiff-necked<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span> people.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8220;Remember! Do not forget how you provoked the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God to wrath in the wilderness. From the day that you departed from the land of Egypt until you came to this place, you have been rebellious against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Also in Horeb you provoked the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> to wrath, so that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was angry <i>enough</i> with you to have destroyed you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>When I went up into the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> made with you, then I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> delivered to me two tablets of stone written with the finger of God, and on them <i>were</i> all the words which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had spoken to you on the mountain from the midst of the fire in<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> the day of the assembly. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And it came to pass, at the end of forty days and forty nights, <i>that</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> gave me the two tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>&#8220;Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to me, &#8216;Arise, go down quickly from here, for your people whom you brought out of Egypt have acted corruptly; they have quickly turned aside from the way which I commanded them; they have made themselves a molded image.&#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8220;Furthermore the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to me, saying, &#8216;I have seen this people, and indeed they are a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>stiff-necked people. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Let Me alone, that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven; and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.&#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>&#8220;So I turned and came down from the mountain, and the mountain burned with fire; and the two tablets of the covenant <i>were</i> in my two hands. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And I looked, and behold, you had sinned against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God&#8212;had made for yourselves a molded calf! You had turned aside quickly from the way which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had commanded you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then I took the two tablets and threw them out of my two hands and broke them before your eyes. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And I fell<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span> down before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, as at the first, forty days and forty nights; I neither ate bread nor drank water, because of all your sin which you committed in doing wickedly in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, to provoke Him to anger. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure with which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was angry with you, to destroy you. But the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> listened to me at that time also. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was very angry with Aaron <i>and</i> would have destroyed him; so I prayed for Aaron also at the same time. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then I took your sin, the calf which you had made, and burned it with fire and crushed it <i>and</i> ground <i>it</i> very small, until it was as fine as dust; and I threw its dust into the brook that descended from the mountain.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>&#8220;Also at Taberah and Massah and Kibroth Hattaavah you <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>provoked the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> to wrath. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Likewise, when the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> sent you from Kadesh Barnea, saying, &#8216;Go up and possess the land which I have given you,&#8217; then you rebelled against the commandment of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God, and you did not believe Him nor obey His voice. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>You have been rebellious against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> from the day that I knew you.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>&#8220;Thus I <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>prostrated myself before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; forty days and forty nights I kept prostrating myself, because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had said He would destroy you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Therefore I prayed to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and said: &#8216;O Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>, do not destroy Your people and Your inheritance whom You have redeemed through Your greatness, whom You have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Remember Your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; do not look on the stubbornness of this people, or on their wickedness or their sin, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>lest the land from which You brought us should say, &#8220;Because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was not able to bring them to the land which He promised them, and because He hated them, He has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Yet they <i>are</i> Your people and Your inheritance, whom You brought out by Your mighty power and by Your outstretched arm.&#8217;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-5163a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Deuteronomy 9:5">Deuteronomy 9:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>perform</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-5164b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Deuteronomy 9:6">Deuteronomy 9:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>stubborn</i> or <i>rebellious</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-5168c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Deuteronomy 9:10">Deuteronomy 9:10</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>when you were all gathered together</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-5171d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Deuteronomy 9:13">Deuteronomy 9:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>stubborn</i> or <i>rebellious</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-5176e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Deuteronomy 9:18">Deuteronomy 9:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>prostrated myself</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-5180f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Deuteronomy 9:22">Deuteronomy 9:22</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>caused the <span class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> to be angry</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-5183g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Deuteronomy 9:25">Deuteronomy 9:25</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>fell down</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
