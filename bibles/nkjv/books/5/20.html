<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So it shall be, when you are on the verge of battle, that the priest shall approach and speak to the people. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And he shall say to them, &#8216;Hear, O Israel: Today you are on the verge of battle with your enemies. Do not let your heart faint, do not be afraid, and do not tremble or be terrified because of them; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God <i>is</i> He who goes with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you.&#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8220;Then the officers shall speak to the people, saying: &#8216;What man <i>is there</i> who has built a new house and has not dedicated it? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle and another man dedicate it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Also what man <i>is there</i> who has planted a vineyard and has not eaten of it? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle and another man eat of it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And what man <i>is there</i> who is betrothed to a woman and has not married her? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle and another man marry her.&#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8220;The officers shall speak further to the people, and say, &#8216;What man <i>is there who is</i> fearful and fainthearted?

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And so it shall be, when the officers have finished speaking to the people, that they shall make captains of the armies to lead the people.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8220;When you go near a city to fight against it, then proclaim an offer of peace to it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And it shall be that if they accept your offer of peace, and open to you, then all the people <i>who are</i> found in it shall be placed under tribute to you, and serve you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now if <i>the city</i> will not make peace with you, but war against you, then you shall besiege it. </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But the women, the little ones, the livestock, and all that is in the city, all its spoil, you shall plunder for yourself; and you shall eat the enemies&#8217; plunder which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God gives you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Thus you shall do to all the cities <i>which are</i> very far from you, which <i>are</i> not of the cities of these nations.</span></p> <p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>but you shall utterly destroy them: the Hittite and the Amorite and the Canaanite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite, just as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God has commanded you, </span>
