<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he said to them: &#8220;I <i>am</i> one hundred and twenty years old today. I can no longer go out and come in. Also the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has said to me, &#8216;You shall not cross over this Jordan.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God Himself crosses over before you; He will destroy these nations from before you, and you shall dispossess them. Joshua himself crosses over before you, just as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has said. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will do to them as He did to Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites and their land, when He destroyed them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will give them over to you, that you may do to them according to every commandment which I have commanded you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Be strong and of good courage, do not fear nor be afraid of them; for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God, He <i>is</i> the One who goes with you. He will not leave you nor forsake you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then Moses called Joshua and said to him in the sight of all Israel, &#8220;Be strong and of good courage, for you must go with this people to the land which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has sworn to their fathers to give them, and you shall cause them to inherit it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, He <i>is</i> the One who goes before you.

The Law to Be Read Every Seven Years</span></h3><p><span class="text Deut-31-9"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So Moses wrote this law and delivered it to the priests, the sons of Levi, who bore the ark of the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and to all the elders of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And Moses commanded them, saying: &#8220;At the end of <i>every</i> seven years, at the appointed time in the year of release, at the Feast of Tabernacles, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>when all Israel comes to appear before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God in the place which He chooses, you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Gather the people together, men and women and little ones, and the stranger who <i>is</i> within your gates, that they may hear and that they may learn to fear the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God and carefully observe all the words of this law, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>and <i>that</i> their children, who have not known it, may hear and learn to fear the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God as long as you live in the land which you cross the Jordan to possess.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Prediction of Israel&#8217;s Rebellion</span></h3><p><span class="text Deut-31-14"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;Behold, the days approach when you must die; call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tabernacle of meeting, that I may <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>inaugurate him.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Deut-31-14">So Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves in the tabernacle of meeting. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Now the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> appeared at the tabernacle in a pillar of cloud, and the pillar of cloud stood above the door of the tabernacle.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses: &#8220;Behold, you will <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>rest with your fathers; and this people will rise and play the harlot with the gods of the foreigners of the land, where they go <i>to be</i> among them, and they will forsake Me and break My covenant which I have made with them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then My anger shall be aroused against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide My face from them, and they shall be <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>devoured. And many evils and troubles shall befall them, so that they will say in that day, &#8216;Have not these evils come upon us because our God <i>is</i> not among us?&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And I will surely hide My face in that day because of all the evil which they have done, in that they have turned to other gods.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>&#8220;Now therefore, write down this song for yourselves, and teach it to the children of Israel; put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for Me against the children of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>When I have brought them to the land flowing with milk and honey, of which I swore to their fathers, and they have eaten and filled themselves and grown fat, then they will turn to other gods and serve them; and they will provoke Me and break My covenant. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then it shall be, when many evils and troubles have come upon them, that this song will testify against them as a witness; for it will not be forgotten in the mouths of their descendants, for I know the inclination of their behavior today, even before I have brought them to the land of which I swore <i>to give them.</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Therefore Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it to the children of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Then He inaugurated Joshua the son of Nun, and said, &#8220;Be strong and of good courage; for you shall bring the children of Israel into the land of which I swore to them, and I will be with you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>So it was, when Moses had completed writing the words of this law in a book, when they were finished, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>that Moses commanded the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, saying: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>&#8220;Take this Book of the Law, and put it beside the ark of the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God, that it may be there as a witness against you; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>for I know your rebellion and your stiff neck. <i>If</i> today, while I am yet alive with you, you have been rebellious against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, then how much more after my death? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Gather to me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their hearing and call heaven and earth to witness against them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>For I know that after my death you will become utterly corrupt, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you. And evil will befall you in the latter days, because you will do evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, to provoke Him to anger through the work of your hands.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
