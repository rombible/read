And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> showed him all the land of Gilead as far as Dan, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>all Naphtali and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>Western Sea, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>the South, and the plain of the Valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, as far as Zoar. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to him, &#8220;This <i>is</i> the land of which I swore to give Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, &#8216;I will give it to your descendants.&#8217; I have caused you to see <i>it</i> with your eyes, but you shall not cross over there.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So Moses the servant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And He buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, opposite Beth Peor; but no one knows his grave to this day. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Moses <i>was</i> one hundred and twenty years old when he died. His <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>eyes were not dim nor his natural vigor <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>diminished. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days. So the days of weeping <i>and</i> mourning for Moses ended.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Now Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands on him; so the children of Israel heeded him, and did as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had commanded Moses.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>But since then there has not arisen in Israel a prophet like Moses, whom the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> knew face to face, </span>
