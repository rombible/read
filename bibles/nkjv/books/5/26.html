<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>that you shall take some of the first of all the produce of the ground, which you shall bring from your land that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God is giving you, and put <i>it</i> in a basket and go to the place where the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God chooses to make His name abide. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And you shall go to the one who is priest in those days, and say to him, &#8216;I declare today to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>your God that I have come to the country which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> swore to our fathers to give us.&#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8220;Then the priest shall take the basket out of your hand and set it down before the altar of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And you shall answer and say before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God: &#8216;My father <i>was</i> a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>Syrian, about to perish, and he went down to Egypt and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>dwelt there, few in number; and there he became a nation, great, mighty, and populous. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But the Egyptians mistreated us, afflicted us, and laid hard bondage on us. </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand and with an outstretched arm, with great terror and with signs and wonders. </span>
