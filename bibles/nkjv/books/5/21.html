<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>then your elders and your judges shall go out and measure <i>the distance</i> from the slain man to the surrounding cities. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And it shall be <i>that</i> the elders of the city nearest to the slain man will take a heifer which has not been worked <i>and</i> which has not pulled with a yoke. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>The elders of that city shall bring the heifer down to a valley with flowing water, which is neither plowed nor sown, and they shall break the heifer&#8217;s neck there in the valley. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then the priests, the sons of Levi, shall come near, for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God has chosen them to minister to Him and to bless in the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; by their word every controversy and every <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>assault shall be <i>settled.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And all the elders of that city nearest to the slain <i>man</i> shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then they shall answer and say, &#8216;Our hands have not shed this blood, nor have our eyes seen <i>it.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Provide atonement, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, for Your people Israel, whom You have redeemed, and do not lay innocent blood to the charge of Your people Israel.&#8217; And atonement shall be provided on their behalf for the blood. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So you shall put away the <i>guilt of</i> innocent blood from among you when you do <i>what is</i> right in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.</span></p> <h3>
Female Captives</span></h3><p><span class="text Deut-21-10"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8220;When you go out to war against your enemies, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God delivers them into your hand, and you take them captive, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>and you see among the captives a beautiful woman, and desire her and would take her for your wife, </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>She shall put off the clothes of her captivity, remain in your house, and mourn her father and her mother a full month; after that you may go in to her and be her husband, and she shall be your wife. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And it shall be, if you have no delight in her, then you shall set her free, but you certainly shall not sell her for money; you shall not treat her brutally, because you have humbled her.</span></p> <h3>
Firstborn Inheritance Rights</span></h3><p><span class="text Deut-21-15"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>&#8220;If a man has two wives, one loved and the other unloved, and they have borne him children, <i>both</i> the loved and the unloved, and <i>if</i> the firstborn son is of her who is unloved, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>then it shall be, on the day he bequeaths his possessions to his sons, <i>that</i> he must not bestow firstborn status on the son of the loved wife in preference to the son of the unloved, the <i>true</i> firstborn. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But he shall acknowledge the son of the unloved wife <i>as</i> the firstborn by giving him a double portion of all that he has, for he <i>is</i> the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn <i>is</i> his.</span></p> <h3>
The Rebellious Son</span></h3><p><span class="text Deut-21-18"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>&#8220;If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother, and <i>who,</i> when they have chastened him, will not heed them, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>then his father and his mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his city, to the gate of his city. </span>
