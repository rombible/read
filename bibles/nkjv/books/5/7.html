<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and when the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God delivers them over to you, you shall conquer them <i>and</i> utterly destroy them. You shall make no covenant with them nor show mercy to them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Nor shall you make marriages with them. You shall not give your daughter to their son, nor take their daughter for your son. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For they will turn your sons away from following Me, to serve other gods; so the anger of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will be aroused against you and destroy you suddenly. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But thus you shall deal with them: you shall destroy their altars, and break down their <i>sacred</i> pillars, and cut down their <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>wooden images, and burn their carved images with fire.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>&#8220;For you <i>are</i> a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>holy people to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God; the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God has chosen you to be a people for Himself, a special treasure above all the peoples on the face of the earth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> did not set His love on you nor choose you because you were more in number than any other people, for you were the least of all peoples; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>but because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> loves you, and because He would keep the oath which He swore to your fathers, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you from the house of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;Therefore know that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God, He <i>is</i> God, the faithful God who keeps covenant and mercy for a thousand generations with those who love Him and keep His commandments; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and He repays those who hate Him to their face, to destroy them. He will not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>be slack with him who hates Him; He will repay him to his face. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Therefore you shall keep the commandment, the statutes, and the judgments which I command you today, to observe them.</span></p> <h3>
Blessings of Obedience</span></h3><p><span class="text Deut-7-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>&#8220;Then it shall come to pass, because you listen to these judgments, and keep and do them, that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God will keep with you the covenant and the mercy which He swore to your fathers. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And He will love you and bless you and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>multiply you; He will also bless the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your land, your grain and your new wine and your oil, the increase of your cattle and the offspring of your flock, in the land of which He <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>swore to your fathers to give you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>You shall be blessed above all peoples; there shall not be a male or female barren among you or among your livestock. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will take away from you all sickness, and will afflict you with none of the terrible diseases of Egypt which you have known, but will lay <i>them</i> on all those who hate you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Also you shall <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>destroy all the peoples whom the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God delivers over to you; your eye shall have no pity on them; nor shall you serve their gods, for that <i>will</i> <i>be</i> a snare to you.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>&#8220;If you should say in your heart, &#8216;These nations are greater than I; how can I dispossess them?&#8217;&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>you shall not be afraid of them, <i>but</i> you shall remember well what the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>the great trials which your eyes saw, the signs and the wonders, the mighty hand and the outstretched arm, by which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God brought you out. So shall the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Moreover the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God will send the hornet among them until those who are left, who hide themselves from you, are destroyed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>You shall not be terrified of them; for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God, the great and awesome God, <i>is</i> among you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God will drive out those nations before you little by little; you will be unable to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>destroy them at once, lest the beasts of the field become <i>too</i> numerous for you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>But the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God will deliver them over to you, and will inflict defeat upon them until they are destroyed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And He will deliver their kings into your hand, and you will destroy their name from under heaven; no one shall be able to stand <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>against you until you have destroyed them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>You shall burn the carved images of their gods with fire; you shall not covet<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span> the silver or gold <i>that is</i> on them, nor take <i>it</i> for yourselves, lest you be snared by it; for it <i>is</i> an abomination to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Nor shall you bring an abomination into your house, lest you be doomed to destruction like it.
