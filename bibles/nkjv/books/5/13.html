<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>you shall not listen to the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams, for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God is testing you to know whether you love the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God with all your heart and with all your soul. </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But that prophet or that dreamer of dreams shall be put to death, because he has spoken in order to turn <i>you</i> away from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you from the house of bondage, to entice you from the way in which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God commanded you to walk.
