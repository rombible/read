<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke; and you shall put them in the ark.&#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8220;So I made an ark of acacia wood, hewed two tablets of stone like the first, and went up the mountain, having the two tablets in my hand. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And He wrote on the tablets according to the first writing, the Ten <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>Commandments, which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had spoken to you in the mountain from the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly; and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> gave them to me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then I turned and came down from the mountain, and put the tablets in the ark which I had made; and there they are, just as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> commanded me.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>(Now the children of Israel journeyed from the wells of Bene Jaakan to Moserah, where Aaron died, and where he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered as priest in his <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>stead. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>From there they journeyed to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>rivers of water. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>At that time the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>separated the tribe of Levi to bear the ark of the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, to stand before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> to minister to Him and to bless in His name, to this day. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Therefore Levi has no portion nor inheritance with his brethren; the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>is</i> his inheritance, just as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God promised him.)</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8220;As at the first time, I stayed in the mountain forty days and forty nights; the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> also heard me at that time, <i>and</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> chose not to destroy you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to me, &#8216;Arise, begin <i>your</i> journey before the people, that they may go in and possess the land which I swore to their fathers to give them.&#8217;</span></p> <h3>
The Essence of the Law</span></h3><p><span class="text Deut-10-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>&#8220;And now, Israel, what does the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God require of you, but to fear the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God, to walk in all His ways and to love Him, to serve the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God with all your heart and with all your soul, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span><i>and</i> to keep the commandments of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and His statutes which I command you today for your <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>good? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Indeed heaven and the highest heavens belong to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God, <i>also</i> the earth with all that <i>is</i> in it. </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Therefore circumcise the foreskin of your heart, and be stiff-necked<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span> no longer. </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>He administers justice for the fatherless and the widow, and loves the stranger, giving him food and clothing. </span>
