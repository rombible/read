<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And this <i>is</i> the form of the release: Every creditor who has lent <i>anything</i> to his neighbor shall <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>release <i>it;</i> he shall not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>require <i>it</i> of his neighbor or his brother, because it is called the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s release. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Of a foreigner you may require <i>it;</i> but you shall give up your claim to what is owed by your brother, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>except when there may be no poor among you; for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will greatly bless you in the land which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God is giving you to possess <i>as</i> an inheritance&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>only if you carefully obey the voice of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God, to observe with care all these commandments which I command you today. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>For the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God will bless you just as He promised you; you shall lend to many nations, but you shall not borrow; you shall reign over many nations, but they shall not reign over you.</span></p> <h3>
Generosity to the Poor</span></h3><p><span class="text Deut-15-7"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8220;If there is among you a poor man of your brethren, within any of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>gates in your land which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God is giving you, you shall not harden your heart nor shut your hand from your poor brother, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>but you shall <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>open your hand wide to him and willingly lend him sufficient for his need, whatever he needs. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Beware lest there be a wicked thought in your heart, saying, &#8216;The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand,&#8217; and your eye be evil against your poor brother and you give him nothing, and he cry out to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> against you, and it become sin among you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>You shall surely give to him, and your heart should not be grieved when you give to him, because for this thing the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God will bless you in all your works and in all to which you put your hand. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For the poor will never cease from the land; therefore I command you, saying, &#8216;You shall <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>open your hand wide to your brother, to your poor and your needy, in your land.&#8217;</span></p> <h3>
The Law Concerning Bondservants</span></h3><p><span class="text Deut-15-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>&#8220;If your brother, a Hebrew man, or a Hebrew woman, is sold to you and serves you six years, then in the seventh year you shall let him go free from you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And when you <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>send him away free from you, you shall not let him go away empty-handed; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>you shall supply him liberally from your flock, from your threshing floor, and from your winepress. <i>From what</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God has blessed you with, you shall give to him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God redeemed you; therefore I command you this thing today. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And if it happens that he says to you, &#8216;I will not go away from you,&#8217; because he loves you and your house, since he prospers with you, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>then you shall take an awl and thrust <i>it</i> through his ear to the door, and he shall be your servant forever. Also to your female servant you shall do likewise. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>It shall not seem hard to you when you send him away free from you; for he has been worth a double hired servant in serving you six years. Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God will bless you in all that you do.</span></p> <h3>
The Law Concerning Firstborn Animals</span></h3><p><span class="text Deut-15-19"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>&#8220;All the firstborn males that come from your herd and your flock you shall <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>sanctify to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God; you shall do no work with the firstborn of your herd, nor shear the firstborn of your flock. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>You and your household shall eat <i>it</i> before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God year by year in the place which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> chooses. </span>
