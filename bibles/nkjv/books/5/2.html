<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to me, saying: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8216;You have skirted this mountain long enough; turn northward. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And command the people, saying, &#8220;You <i>are about to</i> pass through the territory of your brethren, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir; and they will be afraid of you. Therefore watch yourselves carefully. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Do not meddle with them, for I will not give you <i>any</i> of their land, no, not so much as one footstep, because I have given Mount Seir to Esau <i>as</i> a possession. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>You shall buy food from them with money, that you may eat; and you shall also buy water from them with money, that you may drink.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8220;For the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God has blessed you in all the work of your hand. He knows your <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>trudging through this great wilderness. These forty years the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God <i>has been</i> with you; you have lacked nothing.&#8221; &#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8220;And when we passed beyond our brethren, the descendants of Esau who dwell in Seir, away from the road of the plain, away from Elath and Ezion Geber, we turned and passed by way of the Wilderness of Moab. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to me, &#8216;Do not harass Moab, nor contend with them in battle, for I will not give you <i>any</i> of their land <i>as</i> a possession, because I have given Ar to the descendants of Lot <i>as</i> a possession.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>(The Emim had dwelt there in times past, a people as great and numerous and tall as the Anakim. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>They were also regarded as <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>giants, like the Anakim, but the Moabites call them Emim. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>The Horites formerly dwelt in Seir, but the descendants of Esau dispossessed them and destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>place, just as Israel did to the land of their possession which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> gave them.)</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8220; &#8216;Now rise and cross over the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>Valley of the Zered.&#8217; So we crossed over the Valley of the Zered. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And the time we took to come from Kadesh Barnea until we crossed over the Valley of the Zered <i>was</i> thirty-eight years, until all the generation of the men of war <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>was consumed from the midst of the camp, just as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had sworn to them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>For indeed the hand of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was against them, to destroy them from the midst of the camp until they <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>were consumed.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>&#8220;So it was, when all the men of war had finally perished from among the people, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to me, saying: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>&#8216;This day you are to cross over at Ar, the boundary of Moab. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And <i>when</i> you come near the people of Ammon, do not harass them or meddle with them, for I will not give you <i>any</i> of the land of the people of Ammon <i>as</i> a possession, because I have given it to the descendants of Lot <i>as</i> a possession.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>(That was also regarded as a land of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>giants; giants formerly dwelt there. But the Ammonites call them Zamzummim, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>a people as great and numerous and tall as the Anakim. But the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> destroyed them before them, and they dispossessed them and dwelt in their place, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>just as He had done for the descendants of Esau, who dwelt in Seir, when He destroyed the Horites from before them. They dispossessed them and dwelt in their place, even to this day. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And the Avim, who dwelt in villages as far as Gaza&#8212;the Caphtorim, who came from Caphtor, destroyed them and dwelt in their place.)</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>&#8220; &#8216;Rise, take your journey, and cross over the River Arnon. Look, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land. Begin <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>to possess <i>it,</i> and engage him in battle. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>This day I will begin to put the dread and fear of you upon the nations <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>under the whole heaven, who shall hear the report of you, and shall tremble and be in anguish because of you.&#8217;</span></p> <h3>
King Sihon Defeated</span></h3><p><span class="text Deut-2-26"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>&#8220;And I sent messengers from the Wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon, with words of peace, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>&#8216;Let me pass through your land; I will keep strictly to the road, and I will turn neither to the right nor to the left. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat, and give me water for money, that I may drink; only let me pass through on foot, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>just as the descendants of Esau who dwell in Seir and the Moabites who dwell in Ar did for me, until I cross the Jordan to the land which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God is giving us.&#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>&#8220;But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass through, for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate, that He might deliver him into your hand, as <i>it is</i> this day.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>&#8220;And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to me, &#8216;See, I have begun to give Sihon and his land over to you.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Then Sihon and all his people came out against us to fight at Jahaz. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God delivered him <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span>over to us; so we defeated him, his sons, and all his people. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>We took all his cities at that time, and we utterly destroyed the men, women, and little ones of every city; we left none remaining. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>We took only the livestock as plunder for ourselves, with the spoil of the cities which we took. </span>
