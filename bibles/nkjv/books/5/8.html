<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And you shall remember that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God led you all the way these forty years in the wilderness, to humble you <i>and</i> test you, to know what <i>was</i> in your heart, whether you would keep His commandments or not. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So He humbled you, allowed you to hunger, and fed you with manna which you did not know nor did your fathers know, that He might make you know that man shall not live by bread alone; but man lives by every <i>word</i> that proceeds from the mouth of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Your garments did not wear out on you, nor did your foot swell these forty years. </span>
