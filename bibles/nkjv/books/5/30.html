<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and you return to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God and obey His voice, according to all that I command you today, you and your children, with all your heart and with all your soul, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God will bring you back from captivity, and have compassion on you, and gather you again from all the nations where the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God has scattered you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>If <i>any</i> of you are driven out to the farthest <i>parts</i> under heaven, from there the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God will gather you, and from there He will bring you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God will bring you to the land which your fathers possessed, and you shall possess it.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your descendants, to love the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God with all your heart and with all your soul, that you may live.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8220;Also the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God will put all these curses on your enemies and on those who hate you, who persecuted you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And you will again obey the voice of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and do all His commandments which I command you today. </span>

The Choice of Life or Death</span></h3><p><span class="text Deut-30-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8220;For this commandment which I command you today <i>is</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>not <i>too</i> mysterious for you, nor <i>is</i> it far off. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>It <i>is</i> not in heaven, that you should say, &#8216;Who will ascend into heaven for us and bring it to us, that we may hear it and do it?&#8217; </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But the word <i>is</i> very near you, in your mouth and in your heart, that you may do it.</span></p> <p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But if your heart turns away so that you do not hear, and are drawn away, and worship other gods and serve them, </span>
