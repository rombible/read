<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to me, &#8216;Do not fear him, for I have delivered him and all his people and his land into your hand; you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.&#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8220;So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God also delivered into our hands Og king of Bashan, with all his people, and we <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>attacked him until he had no survivors remaining. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And we took all his cities at that time; there was not a city which we did not take from them: sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>All these cities <i>were</i> fortified with high walls, gates, and bars, besides a great many rural towns. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And we utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children of every city. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But all the livestock and the spoil of the cities we took as booty for ourselves.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8220;And at that time we took the land from the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who <i>were</i> on this side of the Jordan, from the River Arnon to Mount Hermon </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>(the Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir), </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>all the cities of the plain, all Gilead, and all Bashan, as far as Salcah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8220;For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>giants. Indeed his bedstead <i>was</i> an iron bedstead. (<i>Is</i> it not in Rabbah of the people of Ammon?) Nine cubits <i>is</i> its length and four cubits its width, according to the standard cubit.</span></p> <h3>
The Land East of the Jordan Divided</span></h3><p><span class="text Deut-3-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>&#8220;And this land, <i>which</i> we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which <i>is</i> by the River Arnon, and half the mountains of Gilead and its cities, I gave to the Reubenites and the Gadites. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>The rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to half the tribe of Manasseh. (All the region of Argob, with all Bashan, was called the land of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>giants. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob, as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and called Bashan after his own name, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>Havoth Jair, to this day.)</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>&#8220;Also I gave Gilead to Machir. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And to the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave from Gilead as far as the River Arnon, the middle of the river as <i>the</i> border, as far as the River Jabbok, the border of the people of Ammon; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>the plain also, with the Jordan as <i>the</i> border, from Chinnereth as far as the east side of the Sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea), below the slopes of Pisgah.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>&#8220;Then I commanded you at that time, saying: &#8216;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God has given you this land to possess. All you men of valor shall cross over armed before your brethren, the children of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>But your wives, your little ones, and your livestock (I know that you have much livestock) shall stay in your cities which I have given you, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>until the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has given rest to your brethren as to you, and they also possess the land which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God is giving them beyond the Jordan. Then each of you may return to his possession which I have given you.&#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>&#8220;And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, &#8216;Your eyes have seen all that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God has done to these two kings; so will the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> do to all the kingdoms through which you pass. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>You must not fear them, for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God Himself fights for you.&#8217;</span></p> <h3>
Moses Forbidden to Enter the Land</span></h3><p><span class="text Deut-3-23"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>&#8220;Then I pleaded with the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> at that time, saying: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>&#8216;O Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>, You have begun to show Your servant Your greatness and Your <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>mighty hand, for what god <i>is there</i> in heaven or on earth who can do <i>anything</i> like Your works and Your mighty <i>deeds?</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>I pray, let me cross over and see the good land beyond the Jordan, those pleasant mountains, and Lebanon.&#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>&#8220;But the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was angry with me on your account, and would not listen to me. So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to me: &#8216;Enough of that! Speak no more to Me of this matter. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Go up to the top of Pisgah, and lift your eyes toward the west, the north, the south, and the east; behold <i>it</i> with your eyes, for you shall not cross over this Jordan. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>But command<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span> Joshua, and encourage him and strengthen him; for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which you will see.&#8217;</span></p> <p>
