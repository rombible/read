<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Now it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first <i>day</i> of the month, <i>that</i> Moses spoke to the children of Israel according to all that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had given him as commandments to them, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>after he had killed Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan, who dwelt at Ashtaroth in<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> Edrei.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>On this side of the Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses began to explain this law, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>&#8220;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying: &#8216;You have dwelt long enough at this mountain. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Turn and take your journey, and go to the mountains of the Amorites, to all the neighboring <i>places</i> in the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>plain, in the mountains and in the lowland, in the South and on the seacoast, to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon, as far as the great river, the River Euphrates. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>See, I have set the land before you; go in and possess the land which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>swore to your fathers&#8212;to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&#8212;to give to them and their descendants after them.&#8217;</span></p> <h3>
Tribal Leaders Appointed</span></h3><p><span class="text Deut-1-9"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;And I spoke to you at that time, saying: &#8216;I <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>alone am not able to bear you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God has multiplied you, and here you <i>are</i> today, as the stars of heaven in multitude. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>May the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of your fathers make you a thousand times more numerous than you are, and bless you as He has promised you! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>How can I alone bear your problems and your burdens and your complaints? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Choose wise, understanding, and knowledgeable men from among your tribes, and I will make them <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>heads over you.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And you answered me and said, &#8216;The thing which you have told <i>us</i> to do <i>is</i> good.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So I took the heads of your tribes, wise and knowledgeable men, and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>made them heads over you, leaders of thousands, leaders of hundreds, leaders of fifties, leaders of tens, and officers for your tribes.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>&#8220;Then I commanded your judges at that time, saying, &#8216;Hear <i>the cases</i> between your brethren, and judge righteously between a man and his brother or the stranger who is with him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>You shall not show partiality in judgment; you shall hear the small as well as the great; you shall not be afraid in any man&#8217;s presence, for the judgment <i>is</i> God&#8217;s.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And I commanded you at that time all the things which you should do.</span></p> <h3>
Israel&#8217;s Refusal to Enter the Land</span></h3><p><span class="text Deut-1-19"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>&#8220;So we departed from Horeb, and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which you saw on the way to the mountains of the Amorites, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God had commanded us. Then we came to Kadesh Barnea. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And I said to you, &#8216;You have come to the mountains of the Amorites, which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God is giving us. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Look, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God has set the land before you; go up <i>and</i> possess <i>it,</i> as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of your fathers has spoken to you; do not fear or be discouraged.&#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>&#8220;And every one of you came near to me and said, &#8216;Let us send men before us, and let them search out the land for us, and bring back word to us of the way by which we should go up, and of the cities into which we shall come.&#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>&#8220;The plan pleased me well; so I took twelve of your men, one man from <i>each</i> tribe. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And they departed and went up into the mountains, and came to the Valley of Eshcol, and spied it out. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>They also took <i>some</i> of the fruit of the land in their hands and brought <i>it</i> down to us; and they brought back word to us, saying, &#8216;<i>It is</i> a good land which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God is giving us.&#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>&#8220;Nevertheless you would not go up, but rebelled against the command of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>and you complained in your tents, and said, &#8216;Because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> hates us, He has brought us out of the land of Egypt to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Where can we go up? Our brethren have <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>discouraged our hearts, saying, &#8220;The people <i>are</i> greater and taller than we; the cities <i>are</i> great and fortified up to heaven; moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.&#8221; &#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>&#8220;Then I said to you, &#8216;Do not be terrified, or afraid of them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God, who goes before you, He will fight for you, according to all He did for you in Egypt before your eyes, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>and in the wilderness where you saw how the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God carried you, as a man carries his son, in all the way that you went until you came to this place.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Yet, for all that, you did not believe the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>who went in the way before you to search out a place for you to pitch your tents, to show you the way you should go, in the fire by night and in the cloud by day.</span></p> <h3>
The Penalty for Israel&#8217;s Rebellion</span></h3><p><span class="text Deut-1-34"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>&#8220;And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> heard the sound of your words, and was angry, and took an oath, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>&#8216;Surely not one of these men of this evil generation shall see that good land of which I <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>swore to give to your fathers, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>except Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him and his children I am giving the land on which he walked, because he <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span>wholly followed the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was also angry with me for your sakes, saying, &#8216;Even you shall not go in there. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, he shall go in there. Encourage him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>&#8216;Moreover your little ones and your children, who you say will be victims, who today have no knowledge of good and evil, they shall go in there; to them I will give it, and they shall possess it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>But <i>as for</i> you, turn and take your journey into the wilderness by the Way of the Red Sea.&#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>&#8220;Then you answered and said to me, &#8216;We have sinned against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; we will go up and fight, just as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God commanded us.&#8217; And when everyone of you had girded on his weapons of war, you were ready to go up into the mountain.</span></p> <p>
