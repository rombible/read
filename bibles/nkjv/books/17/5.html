<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So it was, when the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court, <i>that</i> she found favor in his sight, and the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that <i>was</i> in his hand. Then Esther went near and touched the top of the scepter.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And the king said to her, &#8220;What do you wish, Queen Esther? What <i>is</i> your request? It shall be given to you&#8212;up to half the kingdom!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So Esther answered, &#8220;If it pleases the king, let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then the king said, &#8220;Bring Haman quickly, that he may do as Esther has said.&#8221; So the king and Haman went to the banquet that Esther had prepared.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>At the banquet of wine the king said to Esther, &#8220;What <i>is</i> your petition? It shall be granted you. What <i>is</i> your request, up to half the kingdom? It shall be done!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then Esther answered and said, &#8220;My petition and request <i>is this:</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>fulfill my request, then let the king and Haman come to the banquet which I will prepare for them, and tomorrow I will do as the king has said.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Haman&#8217;s Plot Against Mordecai</span></h3><p><span class="text Esth-5-9"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So Haman went out that day joyful and with a glad heart; but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king&#8217;s gate, and that he did not stand or tremble before him, he was filled with indignation against Mordecai. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Nevertheless Haman restrained himself and went home, and he sent and called for his friends and his wife Zeresh. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then Haman told them of his great riches, the multitude of his children, everything in which the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the officials and servants of the king.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Moreover Haman said, &#8220;Besides, Queen Esther invited no one but me to come in with the king to the banquet that she prepared; and tomorrow I am again invited by her, along with the king. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/5-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Yet all this avails me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king&#8217;s gate.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/5-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then his wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him, &#8220;Let a gallows<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> be made, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>fifty cubits high, and in the morning suggest to the king that Mordecai be hanged on it; then go merrily with the king to the banquet.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Esth-5-14">And the thing pleased Haman; so he had the gallows made.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-12781a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 5:1">Esther 5:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>LXX adds many extra details in vv. <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Esth.5.1" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=Esth.5.1&amp;version=NKJV">1</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Esth.5.2" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=Esth.5.2&amp;version=NKJV">2</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12788b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 5:8">Esther 5:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>to do</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12794c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 5:14">Esther 5:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>tree</i> or <i>wood</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12794d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 5:14">Esther 5:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'>About 75 feet</span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
