So one was commanded to bring the book of the records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And it was found written that Mordecai had told of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king&#8217;s eunuchs, the doorkeepers who had sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then the king said, &#8220;What honor or dignity has been bestowed on Mordecai for this?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Esth-6-3">And the king&#8217;s servants who attended him said, &#8220;Nothing has been done for him.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/6-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So the king said, &#8220;Who <i>is</i> in the court?&#8221; Now Haman had <i>just</i> entered the outer court of the king&#8217;s palace to suggest that the king hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/6-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>The king&#8217;s servants said to him, &#8220;Haman is there, standing in the court.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Esth-6-5">And the king said, &#8220;Let him come in.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So Haman came in, and the king asked him, &#8220;What shall be done for the man whom the king delights to honor?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Esth-6-6">Now Haman thought in his heart, &#8220;Whom would the king delight to honor more than me?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And Haman answered the king, &#8220;<i>For</i> the man whom the king delights to honor, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>let a royal robe be brought which the king has worn, and a horse on which the king has ridden, which has a royal <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>crest placed on its head. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then let this robe and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king&#8217;s most noble princes, that he may array the man whom the king delights to honor. Then <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>parade him on horseback through the city square, and proclaim before him: &#8216;Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor!&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/6-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then the king said to Haman, &#8220;Hurry, take the robe and the horse, as you have suggested, and do so for Mordecai the Jew who sits within the king&#8217;s gate! Leave nothing undone of all that you have spoken.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/6-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So Haman took the robe and the horse, arrayed Mordecai and led him on horseback through the city square, and proclaimed before him, &#8220;Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/6-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Afterward Mordecai went back to the king&#8217;s gate. But Haman hurried to his house, mourning and with his head covered. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/6-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>When Haman told his wife Zeresh and all his friends everything that had happened to him, his wise men and his wife Zeresh said to him, &#8220;If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is of Jewish descent, you will not prevail against him but will surely fall before him.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/6-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>While they <i>were</i> still talking with him, the king&#8217;s eunuchs came, and hastened to bring Haman to the banquet which Esther had prepared.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-12795a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 6:1">Esther 6:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>the king&#8217;s sleep fled away</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12796b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 6:2">Esther 6:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Bigthan,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Esth.2.21" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=Esth.2.21&amp;version=NKJV">Esth. 2:21</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12802c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 6:8">Esther 6:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>crown</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12803d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 6:9">Esther 6:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>cause him to ride</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
