<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/7-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And on the second day, at the banquet of wine, the king again said to Esther, &#8220;What <i>is</i> your petition, Queen Esther? It shall be granted you. And what <i>is</i> your request, up to half the kingdom? It shall be done!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/7-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then Queen Esther answered and said, &#8220;If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it pleases the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For we have been sold, my people and I, to be destroyed, to be killed, and to be annihilated. Had we been sold as male and female slaves, I would have held my tongue, although the enemy could never compensate for the king&#8217;s loss.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/7-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So King Ahasuerus answered and said to Queen Esther, &#8220;Who is he, and where is he, who would dare presume in his heart to do such a thing?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/7-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And Esther said, &#8220;The adversary and enemy <i>is</i> this wicked Haman!&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Esth-7-6">So Haman was terrified before the king and queen.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/7-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then the king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine <i>and went</i> into the palace garden; but Haman stood before Queen Esther, pleading for his life, for he saw that evil was determined against him by the king. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/7-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>When the king returned from the palace garden to the place of the banquet of wine, Haman had fallen across the couch where Esther <i>was.</i> Then the king said, &#8220;Will he also assault the queen while I <i>am</i> in the house?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Esth-7-8">As the word left the king&#8217;s mouth, they covered Haman&#8217;s face. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Now Harbonah, one of the eunuchs, said to the king, &#8220;Look! The <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>gallows, fifty cubits high, which Haman made for Mordecai, who spoke good on the king&#8217;s behalf, is standing at the house of Haman.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Esth-7-9">Then the king said, &#8220;Hang him on it!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the king&#8217;s wrath subsided.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-12817a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 7:9">Esther 7:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>tree</i> or <i>wood</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
