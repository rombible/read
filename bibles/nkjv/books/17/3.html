<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And all the king&#8217;s servants who <i>were</i> within the king&#8217;s gate bowed and paid homage to Haman, for so the king had commanded concerning him. But Mordecai would not bow or pay homage. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then the king&#8217;s servants who <i>were</i> within the king&#8217;s gate said to Mordecai, &#8220;Why do you transgress the king&#8217;s command?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Now it happened, when they spoke to him daily and he would not listen to them, that they told <i>it</i> to Haman, to see whether Mordecai&#8217;s words would stand; for <i>Mordecai</i> had told them that he <i>was</i> a Jew. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>When Haman saw that Mordecai did not bow or pay him homage, Haman was filled with wrath. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But he disdained to lay hands on Mordecai alone, for they had told him of the people of Mordecai. Instead, Haman sought to destroy all the Jews who <i>were</i> throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus&#8212;the people of Mordecai.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>In the first month, which is the month of Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur (that <i>is,</i> the lot), before Haman <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>to determine the day and the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>month, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>until <i>it fell on the</i> twelfth <i>month,</i> which <i>is</i> the month of Adar.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus, &#8220;There is a certain people scattered and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of your kingdom; their laws <i>are</i> different from all <i>other</i> people&#8217;s, and they do not keep the king&#8217;s laws. Therefore it <i>is</i> not fitting for the king to let them remain. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>If it pleases the king, let <i>a decree</i> be written that they be destroyed, and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who do the work, to bring <i>it</i> into the king&#8217;s treasuries.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So the king took his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And the king said to Haman, &#8220;The money and the people <i>are</i> given to you, to do with them as seems good to you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then the king&#8217;s scribes were called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and <i>a decree</i> was written according to all that Haman commanded&#8212;to the king&#8217;s satraps, to the governors who <i>were</i> over each province, to the officials of all people, to every province according to its script, and to every people in their language. In the name of King Ahasuerus it was written, and sealed with the king&#8217;s signet ring. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And the letters were sent by couriers into all the king&#8217;s provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate all the Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, on the thirteenth <i>day</i> of the twelfth month, which <i>is</i> the month of Adar, and to plunder their <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>possessions. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>A copy of the document was to be issued as law in every province, being published for all people, that they should be ready for that day. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>The couriers went out, hastened by the king&#8217;s command; and the decree was proclaimed in <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>Shushan the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>citadel. So the king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Shushan was <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>perplexed.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-12755a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 3:7">Esther 3:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>from day to day and month to month</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12755b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 3:7">Esther 3:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'>LXX adds <i>to destroy the people of Mordecai in one day;</i> Vg. adds <i>the nation of the Jews should be destroyed</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12755c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 3:7">Esther 3:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'>So with MT, Vg.; LXX <i>and the lot fell on the fourteenth of the month</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12761d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 3:13">Esther 3:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'>LXX adds the text of the letter here</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12763e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 3:15">Esther 3:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>Susa</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12763f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 3:15">Esther 3:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>palace</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12763g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 3:15">Esther 3:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>in confusion</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
