<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then the king&#8217;s servants who attended him said: &#8220;Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather all the beautiful young virgins to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>Shushan the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>citadel, into the women&#8217;s quarters, under the custody of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Hegai the king&#8217;s eunuch, custodian of the women. And let beauty preparations be given <i>them.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then let the young woman who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Esth-2-4">This thing pleased the king, and he did so.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>In <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>Shushan the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>citadel there was a certain Jew whose name <i>was</i> Mordecai the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span><i>Kish</i><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span> had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives who had been captured with <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And <i>Mordecai</i> had brought up Hadassah, that <i>is,</i> Esther, his uncle&#8217;s daughter, for she had neither father nor mother. The young woman <i>was</i> lovely and beautiful. When her father and mother died, Mordecai took her as his own daughter.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So it was, when the king&#8217;s command and decree were heard, and when many young women were gathered at <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>Shushan the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>citadel, <i>under</i> the custody of Hegai, that Esther also was taken to the king&#8217;s palace, into the care of Hegai the custodian of the women. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Now the young woman pleased him, and she obtained his favor; so he readily gave beauty preparations to her, besides <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>her allowance. Then seven choice maidservants were provided for her from the king&#8217;s palace, and he moved her and her maidservants to the best <i>place</i> in the house of the women.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Esther had not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span>revealed her people or family, for Mordecai had charged her not to reveal <i>it.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And every day Mordecai paced in front of the court of the women&#8217;s quarters, to learn of Esther&#8217;s welfare and what was happening to her.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Each young woman&#8217;s turn came to go in to King Ahasuerus after she had completed twelve months&#8217; preparation, according to the regulations for the women, for thus were the days of their preparation apportioned: six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with perfumes and preparations for beautifying women. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Thus <i>prepared, each</i> young woman went to the king, and she was given whatever she desired to take with her from the women&#8217;s quarters to the king&#8217;s palace. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>In the evening she went, and in the morning she returned to the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king&#8217;s eunuch who kept the concubines. She would not go in to the king again unless the king delighted in her and called for her by name.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Now when the turn came for Esther the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her as his daughter, to go in to the king, she requested nothing but what Hegai the king&#8217;s eunuch, the custodian of the women, advised. And Esther obtained favor in the sight of all who saw her. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus, into his royal palace, in the tenth month, which <i>is</i> the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>The king loved Esther more than all the <i>other</i> women, and she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins; so he set the royal crown upon her head and made her queen instead of Vashti. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/2-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then the king made a great feast, the Feast of Esther, for all his officials and servants; and he proclaimed a holiday in the provinces and gave gifts according to the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[l]</a></span>generosity of a king.</span></p> <h3>
Mordecai Discovers a Plot</span></h3><p><span class="text Esth-2-19"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/2-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>When virgins were gathered together a second time, Mordecai sat within the king&#8217;s gate. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/2-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span><i>Now</i> Esther had not revealed her family and her people, just as Mordecai had charged her, for Esther obeyed the command of Mordecai as when she was brought up by him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/2-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>In those days, while Mordecai sat within the king&#8217;s gate, two of the king&#8217;s eunuchs, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[m]</a></span>Bigthan and Teresh, doorkeepers, became furious and sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/2-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So the matter became known to Mordecai, who told Queen Esther, and Esther informed the king in Mordecai&#8217;s name. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/2-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And when an inquiry was made into the matter, it was confirmed, and both were hanged on a gallows; and it was written in the book of the chronicles in the presence of the king.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-12728a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 2:3">Esther 2:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>Susa</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12728b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 2:3">Esther 2:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>palace</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12728c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 2:3">Esther 2:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. <i>Hege</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12730d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 2:5">Esther 2:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>Susa</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12730e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 2:5">Esther 2:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>palace</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12731f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 2:6">Esther 2:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Who</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12731g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 2:6">Esther 2:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Jehoiachin,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Kgs.24.6" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Kgs.24.6&amp;version=NKJV">2 Kin. 24:6</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12733h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 2:8">Esther 2:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>Susa</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12733i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 2:8">Esther 2:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>palace</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12734j"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 2:9">Esther 2:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>her portions</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12735k"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 2:10">Esther 2:10</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Revealed the identity of</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12743l"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 2:18">Esther 2:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>hand</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12746m"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 2:21">Esther 2:21</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Bigthana,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Esth.6.2" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=Esth.6.2&amp;version=NKJV">Esth. 6:2</span></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
