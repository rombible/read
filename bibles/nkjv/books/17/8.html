And Mordecai came before the king, for Esther had told how he <i>was related</i> to her. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So the king took off his signet ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai; and Esther appointed Mordecai over the house of Haman.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Now Esther spoke again to the king, fell down at his feet, and implored him with tears to counteract the evil of Haman the Agagite, and the scheme which he had devised against the Jews. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And the king held out the golden scepter toward Esther. So Esther arose and stood before the king, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and said, &#8220;If it pleases the king, and if I have found favor in his sight and the thing <i>seems</i> right to the king and I am pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to revoke the letters devised by Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to annihilate the Jews who <i>are</i> in all the king&#8217;s provinces. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>For how can I endure to see the evil that will come to my people? Or how can I endure to see the destruction of my countrymen?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and Mordecai the Jew, &#8220;Indeed, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and they have hanged him on the gallows because he <i>tried to</i> lay his hand on the Jews. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>You yourselves write <i>a decree</i> concerning the Jews, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>as you please, in the king&#8217;s name, and seal <i>it</i> with the king&#8217;s signet ring; for whatever is written in the king&#8217;s name and sealed with the king&#8217;s signet ring no one can revoke.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So the king&#8217;s scribes were called at that time, in the third month, which <i>is</i> the month of Sivan, on the twenty-third <i>day;</i> and it was written, according to all that Mordecai commanded, to the Jews, the satraps, the governors, and the princes of the provinces from India to Ethiopia, one hundred and twenty-seven provinces <i>in all,</i> to every province in its own script, to every people in their own language, and to the Jews in their own script and language. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And he wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus, sealed <i>it</i> with the king&#8217;s signet ring, and sent letters by couriers on horseback, riding on royal horses <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>bred from swift steeds.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>By these letters the king permitted the Jews who <i>were</i> in every city to gather together and protect their lives&#8212;to destroy, kill, and annihilate all the forces of any people or province that would assault them, <i>both</i> little children and women, and to plunder their possessions, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/8-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>on one day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, on the thirteenth <i>day</i> of the twelfth month, which <i>is</i> the month of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Adar. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/8-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>A copy of the document was to be issued as a decree in every province and published for all people, so that the Jews would be ready on that day to avenge themselves on their enemies. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/8-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>The couriers who rode on royal horses went out, hastened and pressed on by the king&#8217;s command. And the decree was issued in <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>Shushan the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>citadel.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/8-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>blue and white, with a great crown of gold and a garment of fine linen and purple; and the city of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>Shushan rejoiced and was glad. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/8-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>The Jews had light and gladness, joy and honor. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/8-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And in every province and city, wherever the king&#8217;s command and decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a holiday. Then many of the people of the land became Jews, because fear of the Jews fell upon them.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-12826a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 8:8">Esther 8:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>as is good in your eyes</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12828b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 8:10">Esther 8:10</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>sons of the swift horses</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12830c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 8:12">Esther 8:12</span> <span class='footnote-text'>LXX adds the text of the letter here</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12832d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 8:14">Esther 8:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>Susa</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12832e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 8:14">Esther 8:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>palace</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12833f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 8:15">Esther 8:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>violet</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12833g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 8:15">Esther 8:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>Susa</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
