On the day that the enemies of the Jews had hoped to overpower them, the opposite occurred, in that the Jews themselves overpowered those who hated them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>The Jews gathered together in their cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus to lay hands on those who sought their harm. And no one could withstand them, because fear of them fell upon all people. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And all the officials of the provinces, the satraps, the governors, and all those doing the king&#8217;s work, helped the Jews, because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For Mordecai <i>was</i> great in the king&#8217;s palace, and his fame spread throughout all the provinces; for this man Mordecai became increasingly prominent. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Thus the Jews defeated all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, with slaughter and destruction, and did what they pleased with those who hated them.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And in Shushan<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span> the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>citadel the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Also Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vajezatha&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews&#8212;they killed; but they did not lay a hand on the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>plunder.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>On that day the number of those who were killed in <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>Shushan the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>citadel <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>was brought to the king. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And the king said to Queen Esther, &#8220;The Jews have killed and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the citadel, and the ten sons of Haman. What have they done in the rest of the king&#8217;s provinces? Now what <i>is</i> your petition? It shall be granted to you. Or what <i>is</i> your further request? It shall be done.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then Esther said, &#8220;If it pleases the king, let it be granted to the Jews who <i>are</i> in Shushan to do again tomorrow according to today&#8217;s decree, and let Haman&#8217;s ten sons be hanged on the gallows.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/9-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So the king commanded this to be done; the decree was issued in Shushan, and they hanged Haman&#8217;s ten sons.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And the Jews who <i>were</i> in <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>Shushan gathered together again on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and killed three hundred men at Shushan; but they did not lay a hand on the plunder.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/9-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>The remainder of the Jews in the king&#8217;s provinces gathered together and protected their lives, had rest from their enemies, and killed seventy-five thousand of their enemies; but they did not lay a hand on the plunder. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/9-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span><i>This was</i> on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar. And on the fourteenth of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span><i>the month</i> they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness.</span></p> <h3>
The Feast of Purim</span></h3><p><span class="text Esth-9-18"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/9-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>But the Jews who <i>were</i> at <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth <i>day,</i> as well as on the fourteenth; and on the fifteenth of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span><i>the month</i> they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/9-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Therefore the Jews of the villages who dwelt in the unwalled towns celebrated the fourteenth day of the month of Adar <i>with</i> gladness and feasting, as a holiday, and for sending presents to one another.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/9-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And Mordecai wrote these things and sent letters to all the Jews, near and far, who <i>were</i> in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/9-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>to establish among them that they should celebrate yearly the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month of Adar, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/9-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>as the days on which the Jews had rest from their enemies, as the month which was turned from sorrow to joy for them, and from mourning to a holiday; that they should make them days of feasting and joy, of sending presents to one another and gifts to the poor. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/9-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>So the Jews accepted the custom which they had begun, as Mordecai had written to them, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/9-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>because Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to annihilate them, and had cast Pur (that <i>is,</i> the lot), to consume them and destroy them; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/9-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>but when <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span><i>Esther</i> came before the king, he commanded by letter that <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[l]</a></span>this wicked plot which <i>Haman</i> had devised against the Jews should return on his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/9-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>So they called these days Purim, after the name <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[m]</a></span>Pur. Therefore, because of all the words of this letter, what they had seen concerning this matter, and what had happened to them, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/9-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>the Jews established and imposed it upon themselves and their descendants and all who would join them, that without fail they should celebrate these two days every year, according to the written <i>instructions</i> and according to the <i>prescribed</i> time, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/9-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span><i>that</i> these days <i>should be</i> remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city, that these days of Purim should not fail <i>to be observed</i> among the Jews, and <i>that</i> the memory of them should not perish among their descendants.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/9-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Then Queen Esther, the daughter of Abihail, with Mordecai the Jew, wrote with full authority to confirm this second letter about Purim. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/9-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And <i>Mordecai</i> sent letters to all the Jews, to the one hundred and twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, <i>with</i> words of peace and truth, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/9-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>to confirm these days of Purim at their <i>appointed</i> time, as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had prescribed for them, and as they had decreed for themselves and their descendants concerning matters of their fasting and lamenting. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/9-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>So the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim, and it was written in the book.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-12841a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 9:6">Esther 9:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>Susa</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12841b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 9:6">Esther 9:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>palace</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12845c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 9:10">Esther 9:10</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>spoil</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12846d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 9:11">Esther 9:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>Susa</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12846e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 9:11">Esther 9:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>palace</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12846f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 9:11">Esther 9:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>came</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12850g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 9:15">Esther 9:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>Susa</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12852h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 9:17">Esther 9:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>it</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12853i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 9:18">Esther 9:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>Susa</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12853j"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 9:18">Esther 9:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>it</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12860k"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 9:25">Esther 9:25</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>she</i> or <i>it</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12860l"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 9:25">Esther 9:25</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>his</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-12861m"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Esther 9:26">Esther 9:26</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Lot</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
