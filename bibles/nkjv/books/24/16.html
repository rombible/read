<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;You shall not take a wife, nor shall you have sons or daughters in this place.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> concerning the sons and daughters who are born in this place, and concerning their mothers who bore them and their fathers who begot them in this land: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8220;They shall die gruesome deaths; they shall not be lamented nor shall they be buried, <i>but</i> they shall be like refuse on the face of the earth. They shall be consumed by the sword and by famine, and their corpses shall be meat for the birds of heaven and for the beasts of the earth.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8220;Do not enter the house of mourning, nor go to lament or bemoan them; for I have taken away My peace from this people,&#8221; says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, &#8220;lovingkindness and mercies. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Both the great and the small shall die in this land. They shall not be buried; neither shall men lament for them, cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Nor shall <i>men</i> break <i>bread</i> in mourning for them, to comfort them for the dead; nor shall <i>men</i> give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or their mother. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Also you shall not go into the house of feasting to sit with them, to eat and drink.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts, the God of Israel: &#8220;Behold, I will cause to cease from this place, before your eyes and in your days, the voice of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8220;And it shall be, when you show this people all these words, and they say to you, &#8216;Why has the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> pronounced all this great disaster against us? Or what <i>is</i> our iniquity? Or what <i>is</i> our sin that we have committed against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God?&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>then you shall say to them, &#8216;Because your fathers have forsaken Me,&#8217; says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; &#8216;they have walked after other gods and have served them and worshiped them, and have forsaken Me and not kept My law. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And you have done worse than your fathers, for behold, each one <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>follows the dictates of his own evil heart, so that no one listens to Me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Therefore I will cast you out of this land into a land that you do not know, neither you nor your fathers; and there you shall serve other gods day and night, where I will not show you favor.&#8217;</span></p> <h3>
God Will Restore Israel</span></h3><p><span class="text Jer-16-14"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>&#8220;Therefore behold, the days are coming,&#8221; says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, &#8220;that it shall no more be said, &#8216;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> lives who brought up the children of Israel from the land of Egypt,&#8217; </span>
