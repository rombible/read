<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>For then the king of Babylon&#8217;s army besieged Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, which <i>was in</i> the king of Judah&#8217;s house. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, &#8220;Why do you prophesy and say, &#8216;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8220;Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape from the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>face to face, and see him eye to eye; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>then he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there he shall be until I visit him,&#8221; says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; &#8220;though you fight with the Chaldeans, you shall not succeed&#8221; &#8217;?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And Jeremiah said, &#8220;The word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came to me, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8216;Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle will come to you, saying, &#8220;Buy my field which <i>is</i> in Anathoth, for the right of redemption <i>is</i> yours to buy <i>it.</i>&#8221; &#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then Hanamel my uncle&#8217;s son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and said to me, &#8216;Please buy my field that <i>is</i> in Anathoth, which <i>is</i> in the country of Benjamin; for the right of inheritance <i>is</i> yours, and the redemption yours; buy <i>it</i> for yourself.&#8217; Then I knew that this was the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So I bought the field from Hanamel, the son of my uncle who <i>was</i> in Anathoth, and weighed <i>out to</i> him the money&#8212;seventeen shekels of silver. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And I signed the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>deed and sealed <i>it,</i> took witnesses, and weighed the money on the scales. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So I took the purchase deed, <i>both</i> that which was sealed <i>according</i> to the law and custom, and that which was open; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>and I gave the purchase deed to Baruch the son of Neriah, son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel my uncle&#8217;s <i>son,</i> and in the presence of the witnesses who signed the purchase deed, before all the Jews who sat in the court of the prison.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8220;Then I charged Baruch before them, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>&#8216;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts, the God of Israel: &#8220;Take these deeds, both this purchase deed which is sealed and this deed which is open, and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may last many days.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>For thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts, the God of Israel: &#8220;Houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land.&#8221; &#8217;</span></p> <h3>
Jeremiah Prays for Understanding</span></h3><p><span class="text Jer-32-16"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>&#8220;Now when I had delivered the purchase deed to Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, saying: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>&#8216;Ah, Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>! Behold, You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and outstretched arm. There is nothing too <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>hard for You. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span><i>You</i> show lovingkindness to thousands, and repay the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them&#8212;the Great, the Mighty God, whose name <i>is</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span><i>You are</i> great in counsel and mighty in <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>work, for Your eyes <i>are</i> open to all the ways of the sons of men, to give everyone according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>You have set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, to this day, and in Israel and among <i>other</i> men; and You have made Yourself a name, as it is this day. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>You have brought Your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and wonders, with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, and with great terror; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>You have given them this land, of which You swore to their fathers to give them&#8212;&#8220;a land flowing with milk and honey.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And they came in and took possession of it, but they have not obeyed Your voice or walked in Your law. They have done nothing of all that You commanded them to do; therefore You have caused all this calamity to come upon them.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>&#8216;Look, the siege mounds! They have come to the city to take it; and the city has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans who fight against it, because of the sword and famine and pestilence. What You have spoken has happened; there You see <i>it!</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And You have said to me, O Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>, &#8220;Buy the field for money, and take witnesses&#8221;!&#8212;yet the city has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <h3>
God&#8217;s Assurance of the People&#8217;s Return</span></h3><p><span class="text Jer-32-26"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Then the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came to Jeremiah, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>&#8220;Behold, I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of all flesh. Is there anything too hard for Me? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Therefore thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8216;Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And the Chaldeans who fight against this city shall come and set fire to this city and burn it, with the houses on whose roofs they have offered incense to Baal and poured out drink offerings to other gods, to provoke Me to anger; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>because the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done only evil before Me from their youth. For the children of Israel have provoked Me only to anger with the work of their hands,&#8217; says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>&#8216;For this city has been to Me <i>a provocation of</i> My anger and My fury from the day that they built it, even to this day; so I will remove it from before My face </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>because of all the evil of the children of Israel and the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke Me to anger&#8212;they, their kings, their princes, their priests, their prophets, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And they have turned to Me the back, and not the face; though I taught them, rising up early and teaching <i>them,</i> yet they have not listened to receive instruction. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>But they set their abominations in <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>the house which is called by My name, to defile it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>And they built the high places of Baal which <i>are</i> in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through <i>the fire</i> to Molech, which I did not command them, nor did it come into My mind that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.&#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>&#8220;Now therefore, thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, concerning this city of which you say, &#8216;It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>Behold, I will gather them out of all countries where I have driven them in My anger, in My fury, and in great wrath; I will bring them back to this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>They shall be My people, and I will be their God; </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from doing them good; but I will put My fear in their hearts so that they will not depart from Me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>Yes, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>assuredly plant them in this land, with all My heart and with all My soul.&#8217;</span></p> <p>
