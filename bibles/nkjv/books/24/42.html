<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and said to Jeremiah the prophet, &#8220;Please, let our petition be acceptable to you, and pray for us to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God, for all this remnant (since we are left <i>but</i> a few of many, as you can see), </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God may show us the way in which we should walk and the thing we should do.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then Jeremiah the prophet said to them, &#8220;I have heard. Indeed, I will pray to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God according to your words, and it shall be, <i>that</i> whatever the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> answers you, I will declare <i>it</i> to you. I will keep nothing back from you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So they said to Jeremiah, &#8220;Let the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> be a true and faithful witness between us, if we do not do according to everything which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God sends us by you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Whether <i>it is</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>pleasing or <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>displeasing, we will obey the voice of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God to whom we send you, that it may be well with us when we obey the voice of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And it happened after ten days that the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came to Jeremiah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then he called Johanan the son of Kareah, all the captains of the forces which <i>were</i> with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and said to them, &#8220;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your petition before Him: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8216;If you will still remain in this land, then I will build you and not pull <i>you</i> down, and I will plant you and not pluck <i>you</i> up. For I relent concerning the disaster that I have brought upon you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom you are afraid; do not be afraid of him,&#8217; says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, &#8216;for I <i>am</i> with you, to save you and deliver you from his hand. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And I will show you mercy, that he may have mercy on you and cause you to return to your own land.&#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8220;But if you say, &#8216;We will not dwell in this land,&#8217; disobeying the voice of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>saying, &#8216;No, but we will go to the land of Egypt where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor be hungry for bread, and there we will dwell&#8217;&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then hear now the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, O remnant of Judah! Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts, the God of Israel: &#8216;If you wholly<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> set your faces to enter Egypt, and go to dwell there, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>then it shall be <i>that</i> the sword which you feared shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt; the famine of which you were afraid shall follow close after you there <i>in</i> Egypt; and there you shall die. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So shall it be with all the men who set their faces to go to Egypt to dwell there. They shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence. And none of them shall remain or escape from the disaster that I will bring upon them.&#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>&#8220;For thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts, the God of Israel: &#8216;As My anger and My fury have been poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so will My fury be poured out on you when you enter Egypt. And you shall be an oath, an astonishment, a curse, and a reproach; and you shall see this place no more.&#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>&#8220;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has said concerning you, O remnant of Judah, &#8216;Do not go to Egypt!&#8217; Know certainly that I have <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>admonished you this day. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>For you <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>were hypocrites in your hearts when you sent me to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God, saying, &#8216;Pray for us to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God, and according to all that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God says, so declare to us and we will do <i>it.</i>&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And I have this day declared <i>it</i> to you, but you have not obeyed the voice of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God, or anything which He has sent you by me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Now therefore, know certainly that you shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence in the place where you desire to go to dwell.&#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-19982a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jeremiah 42:6">Jeremiah 42:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>good</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-19982b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jeremiah 42:6">Jeremiah 42:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>evil</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-19991c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jeremiah 42:15">Jeremiah 42:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>surely</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-19995d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jeremiah 42:19">Jeremiah 42:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>warned</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-19996e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jeremiah 42:20">Jeremiah 42:20</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>used deceit against your souls</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
