<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>that Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men spoke, saying to Jeremiah, &#8220;You speak falsely! The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God has not sent you to say, &#8216;Do not go to Egypt to dwell there.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But Baruch the son of Neriah has <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>set you against us, to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may put us to death or carry us away captive to Babylon.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So Johanan the son of Kareah, all the captains of the forces, and all the people would not obey the voice of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, to remain in the land of Judah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces took all the remnant of Judah who had returned to dwell in the land of Judah, from all nations where they had been driven&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>men, women, children, the king&#8217;s daughters, and every person whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch the son of Neriah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So they went to the land of Egypt, for they did not obey the voice of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. And they went as far as Tahpanhes.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;Take large stones in your hand, and hide them in the sight of the men of Judah, in the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>clay in the brick courtyard which <i>is</i> at the entrance to Pharaoh&#8217;s house in Tahpanhes; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and say to them, &#8216;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts, the God of Israel: &#8220;Behold, I will send and bring Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, My servant, and will set his throne above these stones that I have hidden.
