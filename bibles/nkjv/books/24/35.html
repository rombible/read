<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Go to the house of the Rechabites, speak to them, and bring them into the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, his brothers and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and I brought them into the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah, a man of God, which <i>was</i> by the chamber of the princes, above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>door. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites bowls full of wine, and cups; and I said to them, &#8220;Drink wine.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But they said, &#8220;We will drink no wine, for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, saying, &#8216;You shall drink no wine, you nor your sons, forever. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>You shall not build a house, sow seed, plant a vineyard, nor have <i>any of these;</i> but all your days you shall dwell in tents, that you may live many days in the land where you are sojourners.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Thus we have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all that he charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, or our daughters, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>nor to build ourselves houses to dwell in; nor do we have vineyard, field, or seed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But it came to pass, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, &#8216;Come, let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans and for fear of the army of the Syrians.&#8217; So we dwell at Jerusalem.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then came the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> to Jeremiah, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8220;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts, the God of Israel: &#8216;Go and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, &#8220;Will you not receive instruction to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>obey My words?&#8221; says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>&#8220;The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, which he commanded his sons, not to drink wine, are performed; for to this day they drink none, and obey their father&#8217;s commandment. But although I have spoken to you, rising early and speaking, you did not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>obey Me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>I have also sent to you all My servants the prophets, rising up early and sending <i>them,</i> saying, &#8216;Turn now everyone from his evil way, amend your doings, and do not go after other gods to serve them; then you will dwell in the land which I have given you and your fathers.&#8217; But you have not inclined your ear, nor obeyed Me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Surely the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father, which he commanded them, but this people has not obeyed Me.&#8221; &#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>&#8220;Therefore thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of hosts, the God of Israel: &#8216;Behold, I will bring on Judah and on all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the doom that I have pronounced against them; because I have spoken to them but they have not heard, and I have called to them but they have not answered.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites, &#8220;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts, the God of Israel: &#8216;Because you have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts and done according to all that he commanded you, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>therefore thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts, the God of Israel: &#8220;Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not lack a man to stand before Me forever.&#8221; &#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-19828a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jeremiah 35:4">Jeremiah 35:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>threshold</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-19837b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jeremiah 35:13">Jeremiah 35:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>listen to</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-19838c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jeremiah 35:14">Jeremiah 35:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>listen to</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
