<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8216;Stand in the court of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s house, and speak to all the cities of Judah, which come to worship <i>in</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s house, all the words that I command you to speak to them. Do not diminish a word. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Perhaps everyone will listen and turn from his evil way, that I may relent concerning the calamity which I purpose to bring on them because of the evil of their doings.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And you shall say to them, &#8216;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8220;If you will not listen to Me, to walk in My law which I have set before you, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>to heed the words of My servants the prophets whom I sent to you, both rising up early and sending <i>them</i> (but you have not heeded), </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>then I will make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.&#8221; &#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Now it happened, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had commanded <i>him</i> to speak to all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people seized him, saying, &#8220;You will surely die! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Why have you prophesied in the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, saying, &#8216;This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate, without an inhabitant&#8217;?&#8221; And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>When the princes of Judah heard these things, they came up from the king&#8217;s house to the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and sat down in the entry of the New Gate of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s <i>house.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And the priests and the prophets spoke to the princes and all the people, saying, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>&#8220;This man deserves to die! For he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your ears.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then Jeremiah spoke to all the princes and all the people, saying: &#8220;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city with all the words that you have heard. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Now therefore, amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God; then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will relent concerning the doom that He has pronounced against you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>As for me, here I am, in your hand; do with me as seems good and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>proper to you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But know for certain that if you put me to death, you will surely bring innocent blood on yourselves, on this city, and on its inhabitants; for truly the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has sent me to you to speak all these words in your hearing.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So the princes and all the people said to the priests and the prophets, &#8220;This man does not deserve to die. For he has spoken to us in the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then certain of the elders of the land rose up and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>&#8220;Micah of Moresheth prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, &#8216;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Jer-26-18">&#8220;Zion shall be plowed <i>like</i> a field,</span><br /><span class="text Jer-26-18">Jerusalem shall become heaps of ruins,</span><br /><span class="text Jer-26-18">And the mountain of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>temple</span><br /><span class="text Jer-26-18">Like the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>bare hills of the forest.&#8221; &#8217;</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah ever put him to death?

And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> relented concerning the doom which He had pronounced against them. But we are doing great evil against ourselves.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Now there was also a man who prophesied in the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjath Jearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death; but when Urijah heard <i>it,</i> he was afraid and fled, and went to Egypt. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then Jehoiakim the king sent men to Egypt: Elnathan the son of Achbor, and <i>other</i> men <i>who went</i> with him to Egypt. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And they brought Urijah from Egypt and brought him to Jehoiakim the king, who killed him with the sword and cast his dead body into the graves of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>common people.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, so that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-19584a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jeremiah 26:11">Jeremiah 26:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>A judgment of death to this man</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-19587b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jeremiah 26:14">Jeremiah 26:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>right</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-19591c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jeremiah 26:18">Jeremiah 26:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>house</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-19591d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jeremiah 26:18">Jeremiah 26:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>high places</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-19596e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jeremiah 26:23">Jeremiah 26:23</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>sons of the people</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
