<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>One basket <i>had</i> very good figs, like the figs <i>that are</i> first ripe; and the other basket <i>had</i> very bad figs which could not be eaten, they were so bad. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to me, &#8220;What do you see, Jeremiah?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Jer-24-3">And I said, &#8220;Figs, the good figs, very good; and the bad, very bad, which cannot be eaten, they are so bad.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Again the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came to me, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8220;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel: &#8216;Like these good figs, so will I <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>acknowledge those who are carried away captive from Judah, whom I have sent out of this place for <i>their own</i> good, into the land of the Chaldeans. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>For I will set My eyes on them for good, and I will bring them back to this land; I will build them and not pull <i>them</i> down, and I will plant them and not pluck <i>them</i> up. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then I will give them a heart to know Me, that I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; and they shall be My people, and I will be their God, for they shall return to Me with their whole heart.</span></p> <p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>I will deliver them to trouble into all the kingdoms of the earth, for <i>their</i> harm, <i>to be</i> a reproach and a byword, a taunt and a curse, in all places where I shall drive them. </span>
