<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts, the God of Israel: &#8216;You have seen all the calamity that I have brought on Jerusalem and on all the cities of Judah; and behold, this day they <i>are</i> a desolation, and no one dwells in them, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke Me to anger, in that they went to burn incense <i>and</i> to serve other gods whom they did not know, they nor you nor your fathers. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>However I have sent to you all My servants the prophets, rising early and sending <i>them,</i> saying, &#8220;Oh, do not do this abominable thing that I hate!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But they did not listen or incline their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense to other gods. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So My fury and My anger were poured out and kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>are wasted <i>and</i> desolate, as it is this day.&#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8220;Now therefore, thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: &#8216;Why do you commit <i>this</i> great evil against yourselves, to cut off from you man and woman, child and infant, out of Judah, leaving none to remain, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>in that you provoke Me to wrath with the works of your hands, burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt where you have gone to dwell, that you may cut yourselves off and be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, the wickedness of the kings of Judah, the wickedness of their wives, your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>They have not been humbled,<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> to this day, nor have they feared; they have not walked in My law or in My statutes that I set before you and your fathers.&#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8220;Therefore thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts, the God of Israel: &#8216;Behold, I will set My face against you for catastrophe and for <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>cutting off all Judah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And I will take the remnant of Judah who have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to dwell there, and they shall all be consumed <i>and</i> fall in the land of Egypt. They shall be consumed by the sword <i>and</i> by famine. They shall die, from the least to the greatest, by the sword and by famine; and they shall be an oath, an astonishment, a curse and a reproach! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For I will punish those who dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>so that none of the remnant of Judah who have gone into the land of Egypt to dwell there shall escape or survive, lest they return to the land of Judah, to which they desire<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span> to return and dwell. For none shall return except those who escape.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then all the men who knew that their wives had burned incense to other gods, with all the women who stood by, a great multitude, and all the people who dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>&#8220;<i>As for</i> the word that you have spoken to us in the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, we will not listen to you! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But we will certainly do whatever has gone out of our own mouth, to burn incense to the queen of heaven and pour out drink offerings to her, as we have done, we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. For <i>then</i> we had plenty of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>food, were well-off, and saw no trouble. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>But since we stopped burning incense to the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have lacked everything and have been consumed by the sword and by famine.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span><i>The women also said,</i> &#8220;And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven and poured out drink offerings to her, did we make cakes for her, to worship her, and pour out drink offerings to her without our husbands&#8217; <i>permission?</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then Jeremiah spoke to all the people&#8212;the men, the women, and all the people who had given him <i>that</i> answer&#8212;saying: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>&#8220;The incense that you burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, you and your fathers, your kings and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> remember them, and did it <i>not</i> come into His mind? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> could no longer bear <i>it,</i> because of the evil of your doings <i>and</i> because of the abominations which you committed. Therefore your land is a desolation, an astonishment, a curse, and without an inhabitant, as <i>it is</i> this day. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Because you have burned incense and because you have sinned against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and have not obeyed the voice of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> or walked in His law, in His statutes or in His testimonies, therefore this calamity has happened to you, as <i>at</i> this day.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Moreover Jeremiah said to all the people and to all the women, &#8220;Hear the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, all Judah who <i>are</i> in the land of Egypt! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts, the God of Israel, saying: &#8216;You and your wives have spoken with your mouths and fulfilled with your hands, saying, &#8220;We will surely keep our vows that we have made, to burn incense to the queen of heaven and pour out drink offerings to her.&#8221; You will surely keep your vows and perform your vows!&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Therefore hear the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, all Judah who dwell in the land of Egypt: &#8216;Behold, I have sworn by My great name,&#8217; says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, &#8216;that My name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, &#8220;The Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span> lives.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Behold, I will watch over them for adversity and not for good. And all the men of Judah who <i>are</i> in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by famine, until there is an end to them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Yet a small number who escape the sword shall return from the land of Egypt to the land of Judah; and all the remnant of Judah, who have gone to the land of Egypt to dwell there, shall know whose words will stand, Mine or theirs. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And this <i>shall be</i> a sign to you,&#8217; says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, &#8216;that I will punish you in this place, that you may know that My words will surely stand against you for adversity.&#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>&#8220;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8216;Behold, I will give Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies and into the hand of those who seek his life, as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, his enemy who sought his life.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-20012a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jeremiah 44:1">Jeremiah 44:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Ancient Memphis</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-20017b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jeremiah 44:6">Jeremiah 44:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>became a ruin</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-20021c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jeremiah 44:10">Jeremiah 44:10</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>crushed</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-20022d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jeremiah 44:11">Jeremiah 44:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>destroying</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-20025e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jeremiah 44:14">Jeremiah 44:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>lift up their soul</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-20028f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jeremiah 44:17">Jeremiah 44:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>bread</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
