<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Please inquire of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> for us, for <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon makes war against us. Perhaps the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will deal with us according to all His wonderful works, that <i>the king</i> may go away from us.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then Jeremiah said to them, &#8220;Thus you shall say to Zedekiah, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8216;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel: &#8220;Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that <i>are</i> in your hands, with which you fight against the king of Babylon and the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>Chaldeans who besiege you outside the walls; and I will assemble them in the midst of this city. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>I Myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger and fury and great wrath. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>I will strike the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast; they shall die of a great pestilence. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And afterward,&#8221; says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, &#8220;I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah, his servants and the people, and such as are left in this city from the pestilence and the sword and the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek their life; and he shall strike them with the edge of the sword. He shall not spare them, or have pity or mercy.&#8221; &#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8220;Now you shall say to this people, &#8216;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8220;Behold, I set before you the way of life and the way of death. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>He who remains in this city shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence; but he who goes out and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>defects to the Chaldeans who besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be as a prize to him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For I have set My face against this city for adversity and not for good,&#8221; says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. &#8220;It shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.&#8221; &#8217;</span></p> <h3>
