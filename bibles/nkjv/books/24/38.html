<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8216;He who remains in this city shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence; but he who goes over to the Chaldeans shall live; his life shall be as a prize to him, and he shall live.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8216;This city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon&#8217;s army, which shall take it.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Therefore the princes said to the king, &#8220;Please, let this man be put to death, for thus he <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>weakens the hands of the men of war who remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, by speaking such words to them. For this man does not seek the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>welfare of this people, but their harm.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then Zedekiah the king said, &#8220;Look, he <i>is</i> in your hand. For the king can <i>do</i> nothing against you.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So they took Jeremiah and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>the king&#8217;s son, which <i>was</i> in the court of the prison, and they let Jeremiah down with ropes. And in the dungeon <i>there was</i> no water, but mire. So Jeremiah sank in the mire.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now Ebed-Melech the Ethiopian, one of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>eunuchs, who was in the king&#8217;s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon. When the king was sitting at the Gate of Benjamin, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Ebed-Melech went out of the king&#8217;s house and spoke to the king, saying: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon, and he is likely to die from hunger in the place where he is. For <i>there is</i> no more bread in the city.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then the king commanded Ebed-Melech the Ethiopian, saying, &#8220;Take from here thirty men with you, and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon before he dies.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So Ebed-Melech took the men with him and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took from there old clothes and old rags, and let them down by ropes into the dungeon to Jeremiah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then Ebed-Melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, &#8220;Please put these old clothes and rags under your armpits, under the ropes.&#8221; And Jeremiah did so. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So they pulled Jeremiah up with ropes and lifted him out of the dungeon. And Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.</span></p> <h3>
Zedekiah&#8217;s Fears and Jeremiah&#8217;s Advice</span></h3><p><span class="text Jer-38-14"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then Zedekiah the king sent and had Jeremiah the prophet brought to him at the third entrance of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. And the king said to Jeremiah, &#8220;I will ask you something. Hide nothing from me.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, &#8220;If I declare <i>it</i> to you, will you not surely put me to death? And if I give you advice, you will not listen to me.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So Zedekiah the king swore secretly to Jeremiah, saying, &#8220;<i>As</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> lives, who made our very souls, I will not put you to death, nor will I give you into the hand of these men who seek your life.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, &#8220;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: &#8216;If you surely surrender<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span> to the king of Babylon&#8217;s princes, then your soul shall live; this city shall not be burned with fire, and you and your house shall live. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>But if you do not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>surrender to the king of Babylon&#8217;s princes, then this city shall be given into the hand of the Chaldeans; they shall burn it with fire, and you shall not escape from their hand.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, &#8220;I am afraid of the Jews who have defected to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they abuse me.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>But Jeremiah said, &#8220;They shall not deliver <i>you.</i> Please, obey the voice of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> which I speak to you. So it shall be well with you, and your soul shall live. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>But if you refuse to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>surrender, this <i>is</i> the word that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has shown me: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>&#8216;Now behold, all the women who are left in the king of Judah&#8217;s house <i>shall be</i> surrendered to the king of Babylon&#8217;s princes, and those <i>women</i> shall say:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Jer-38-22">&#8220;Your close friends have <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>set upon you</span><br /><span class="text Jer-38-22">And prevailed against you;</span><br /><span class="text Jer-38-22">Your feet have sunk in the mire,</span><br /><span class="text Jer-38-22"><i>And</i> they have <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>turned away again.&#8221;</span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>&#8216;So they shall surrender all your wives and children to the Chaldeans. You shall not escape from their hand, but shall be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon. And you shall cause this city to be burned with fire.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, &#8220;Let no one know of these words, and you shall not die. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>But if the princes hear that I have talked with you, and they come to you and say to you, &#8216;Declare to us now what you have said to the king, and also what the king said to you; do not hide <i>it</i> from us, and we will not put you to death,&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>then you shall say to them, &#8216;I presented my request before the king, that he would not make me return to Jonathan&#8217;s house to die there.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Then all the princes came to Jeremiah and asked him. And he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they stopped speaking with him, for the conversation had not been heard. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Now Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem was taken. And he was <i>there</i> when Jerusalem was taken.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-19897a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jeremiah 38:1">Jeremiah 38:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Jehucal,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Jer.37.3" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=Jer.37.3&amp;version=NKJV">Jer. 37:3</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-19900b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jeremiah 38:4">Jeremiah 38:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Is discouraging</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-19900c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jeremiah 38:4">Jeremiah 38:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Well-being; lit. <i>peace</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-19902d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jeremiah 38:6">Jeremiah 38:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>son of Hammelech</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-19903e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jeremiah 38:7">Jeremiah 38:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>officers</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-19913f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jeremiah 38:17">Jeremiah 38:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>go out</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-19914g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jeremiah 38:18">Jeremiah 38:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>go out</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-19917h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jeremiah 38:21">Jeremiah 38:21</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>go out</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-19918i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jeremiah 38:22">Jeremiah 38:22</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>misled</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-19918j"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jeremiah 38:22">Jeremiah 38:22</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Deserted you</span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
