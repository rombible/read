<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Stand in the gate of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s house, and proclaim there this word, and say, &#8216;Hear the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, all <i>you of</i> Judah who enter in at these gates to worship the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>!&#8217; &#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts, the God of Israel: &#8220;Amend your ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Do not trust in these lying words, saying, &#8216;The temple of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, the temple of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, the temple of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>are</i> these.&#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8220;For if you thoroughly amend your ways and your doings, if you thoroughly execute <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>judgment between a man and his neighbor, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span><i>if</i> you do not oppress the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and do not shed innocent blood in this place, or walk after other gods to your hurt, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>then I will cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers forever and ever.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8220;Behold, you trust in lying words that cannot profit. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Will you steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely, burn incense to Baal, and walk after other gods whom you do not know, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and <i>then</i> come and stand before Me in this house which is called by My name, and say, &#8216;We are delivered to do all these abominations&#8217;? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Has this house, which is called by My name, become a den of thieves in your eyes? Behold, I, even I, have seen <i>it,</i>&#8221; says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>&#8220;But go now to My place which <i>was</i> in Shiloh, where I set My name at the first, and see what I did to it because of the wickedness of My people Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And now, because you have done all these works,&#8221; says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, &#8220;and I spoke to you, rising up early and speaking, but you did not hear, and I called you, but you did not answer, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>therefore I will do to the house which is called by My name, in which you trust, and to this place which I gave to you and your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And I will cast you out of My sight, as I have cast out all your brethren&#8212;the whole posterity of Ephraim.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>&#8220;Therefore do not pray for this people, nor lift up a cry or prayer for them, nor make intercession to Me; for I will not hear you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Do you not see what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>The children gather wood, the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead dough, to make cakes for the queen of heaven; and <i>they</i> pour out drink offerings to other gods, that they may provoke Me to anger. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Do they provoke Me to anger?&#8221; says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. &#8220;<i>Do they</i> not <i>provoke</i> themselves, to the shame of their own faces?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Therefore thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;Behold, My anger and My fury will be poured out on this place&#8212;on man and on beast, on the trees of the field and on the fruit of the ground. And it will burn and not be quenched.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts, the God of Israel: &#8220;Add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices and eat meat. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>For I did not speak to your fathers, or command them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>But this is what I commanded them, saying, &#8216;Obey My voice, and I will be your God, and you shall be My people. And walk in all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well with you.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, but followed<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span> the counsels <i>and</i> the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>dictates of their evil hearts, and went<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span> backward and not forward. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Since the day that your fathers came out of the land of Egypt until this day, I have even sent to you all My servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending <i>them.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Yet they did not obey Me or incline their ear, but stiffened their neck. They did worse than their fathers.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>&#8220;Therefore you shall speak all these words to them, but they will not obey you. You shall also call to them, but they will not answer you.</span></p> <h3>
Judgment on Obscene Religion</span></h3><p><span class="text Jer-7-28"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>&#8220;So you shall say to them, &#8216;This <i>is</i> a nation that does not obey the voice of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> their God nor receive correction.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Cut off your hair and cast <i>it</i> away, and take up a lamentation on the desolate heights; for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has rejected and forsaken the generation of His wrath.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>For the children of Judah have done evil in My sight,&#8221; says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. &#8220;They have set their abominations in the house which is called by My name, to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>pollute it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>And they have built the high places of Tophet, which <i>is</i> in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire, which I did not command, nor did it come into My heart.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>&#8220;Therefore behold, the days are coming,&#8221; says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, &#8220;when it will no more be called Tophet, or the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter; for they will bury in Tophet until there is no room. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>The corpses of this people will be food for the birds of the heaven and for the beasts of the earth. And no one will frighten <i>them away.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Then I will cause to cease from the cities of Judah and from the streets of Jerusalem the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride.
