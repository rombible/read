<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Thus speaks the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts, the God of Israel, saying: &#8216;I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Within two full years I will bring back to this place all the vessels of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place and carried to Babylon. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And I will bring back to this place <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah who went to Babylon,&#8217; says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, &#8216;for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then the prophet Jeremiah spoke to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests and in the presence of all the people who stood in the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and the prophet Jeremiah said, &#8220;Amen! The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> do so; the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> perform your words which you have prophesied, to bring back the vessels of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s house and all who were carried away captive, from Babylon to this place. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Nevertheless hear now this word that I speak in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>The prophets who have been before me and before you of old prophesied against many countries and great kingdoms&#8212;of war and disaster and pestilence. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>As for the prophet who prophesies of peace, when the word of the prophet comes to pass, the prophet will be known <i>as</i> one whom the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has truly sent.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke off the prophet Jeremiah&#8217;s neck and broke it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, &#8220;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8216;Even so I will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years.&#8217; &#8221; And the prophet Jeremiah went his way.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came to Jeremiah, after Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8220;Go and tell Hananiah, saying, &#8216;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8220;You have broken the yokes of wood, but you have made in their place yokes of iron.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts, the God of Israel: &#8220;I have put a yoke of iron on the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him. I have given him the beasts of the field also.&#8221; &#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then the prophet Jeremiah said to Hananiah the prophet, &#8220;Hear now, Hananiah, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has not sent you, but you make this people trust in a lie. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Therefore thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8216;Behold, I will cast you from the face of the earth. This year you shall die, because you have taught rebellion against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-19623a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jeremiah 28:4">Jeremiah 28:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Jehoiachin,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Kgs.24.12" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Kgs.24.12&amp;version=NKJV">2 Kin. 24:12</span></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
