His mother&#8217;s name <i>was</i> Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>He also did evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, according to all that Jehoiakim had done. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For because of the anger of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>this</i> happened in Jerusalem and Judah, till He finally cast them out from His presence. Then Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Now it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth <i>day</i> of the month, <i>that</i> Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem and encamped against it; and <i>they</i> built a siege wall against it all around. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So the city was besieged until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>By the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, the famine had become so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then the city <i>wall</i> was broken through, and all the men of war fled and went out of the city at night by way of the gate between the two walls, which <i>was</i> by the king&#8217;s garden, even though the Chaldeans <i>were</i> near the city all around. And they went by way of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>plain.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king, and they overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. All his army was scattered from him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So they took the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he pronounced judgment on him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes. And he killed all the princes of Judah in Riblah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>He also put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>bronze fetters, took him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.</span></p> <h3>
The Temple and City Plundered and Burned</span></h3><p><span class="text Jer-52-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now in the fifth month, on the tenth <i>day</i> of the month (which <i>was</i> the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon), Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, <i>who</i> served the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>He burned the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and the king&#8217;s house; all the houses of Jerusalem, that is, all the houses of the great, he burned with fire. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And all the army of the Chaldeans who <i>were</i> with the captain of the guard broke down all the walls of Jerusalem all around. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive <i>some</i> of the poor people, the rest of the people who remained in the city, the defectors who had deserted to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the craftsmen. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left <i>some</i> of the poor of the land as vinedressers and farmers.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>The bronze pillars that <i>were</i> in the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and the carts and the bronze Sea that <i>were</i> in the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, the Chaldeans broke in pieces, and carried all their bronze to Babylon. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>They also took away the pots, the shovels, the trimmers, the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>bowls, the spoons, and all the bronze utensils with which the <i>priests</i> ministered. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>The basins, the firepans, the bowls, the pots, the lampstands, the spoons, and the cups, whatever <i>was</i> solid gold and whatever <i>was</i> solid silver, the captain of the guard took away. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>The two pillars, one Sea, the twelve bronze bulls which <i>were</i> under <i>it, and</i> the carts, which King Solomon had made for the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8212;the bronze of all these articles was beyond measure. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Now <i>concerning</i> the pillars: the height of one pillar <i>was</i> eighteen <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>cubits, a measuring line of twelve cubits could measure its circumference, and its thickness <i>was</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>four fingers; <i>it was</i> hollow. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>A capital of bronze <i>was</i> on it; and the height of one capital <i>was</i> five cubits, with a network and pomegranates all around the capital, all of bronze. The second pillar, with pomegranates was the same. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; all the pomegranates, all around on the network, <i>were</i> one hundred.</span></p> <h3>
The People Taken Captive to Babylonia</span></h3><p><span class="text Jer-52-24"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>The captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the second priest, and the three doorkeepers. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>He also took out of the city an <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>officer who had charge of the men of war, seven men of the king&#8217;s close associates who were found in the city, the principal scribe of the army who mustered the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of the land who were found in the midst of the city. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took these and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Then the king of Babylon struck them and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive from its own land.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>These <i>are</i> the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year, three thousand and twenty-three Jews; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred and thirty-two persons; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred and forty-five persons.

Jehoiachin Released from Prison</span></h3><p><span class="text Jer-52-31"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Now it came to pass in the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth <i>day</i> of the month, <i>that</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>Evil-Merodach king of Babylon, in the <i>first</i> year of his reign, lifted<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span> up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah and brought him out of prison. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And he spoke kindly to him and gave him a more prominent seat than those of the kings who <i>were</i> with him in Babylon. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>So <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>Jehoiachin changed from his prison garments, and he ate bread regularly before the <i>king</i> all the days of his life. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>And as for his provisions, there was a regular ration given him by the king of Babylon, a portion for each day until the day of his death, all the days of his life.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-20284a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jeremiah 52:7">Jeremiah 52:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>Arabah;</i> the Jordan Valley</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-20288b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jeremiah 52:11">Jeremiah 52:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>shackles</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-20295c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jeremiah 52:18">Jeremiah 52:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>basins</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-20298d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jeremiah 52:21">Jeremiah 52:21</span> <span class='footnote-text'>18 inches each</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-20298e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jeremiah 52:21">Jeremiah 52:21</span> <span class='footnote-text'>3 inches</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-20302f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jeremiah 52:25">Jeremiah 52:25</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>eunuch</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-20308g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jeremiah 52:31">Jeremiah 52:31</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>Awil-Marduk;</i> lit. <i>The Man of Marduk</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-20308h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jeremiah 52:31">Jeremiah 52:31</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Showed favor to</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-20310i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jeremiah 52:33">Jeremiah 52:33</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>he</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
