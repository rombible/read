<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>In the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, on the ninth <i>day</i> of the month, the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>city was penetrated.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then all the princes of the king of Babylon came in and sat in the Middle Gate: Nergal-Sharezer, Samgar-Nebo, Sarsechim, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>Rabsaris, Nergal-Sarezer, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Rabmag, with the rest of the princes of the king of Babylon.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So it was, when Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, that they fled and went out of the city by night, by way of the king&#8217;s garden, by the gate between the two walls. And he went out by way of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>plain. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But the Chaldean army pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. And when they had captured him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he pronounced judgment on him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes in Riblah; the king of Babylon also killed all the nobles of Judah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Moreover he put out Zedekiah&#8217;s eyes, and bound him with bronze <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>fetters to carry him off to Babylon. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And the Chaldeans burned the king&#8217;s house and the houses of the people with fire, and broke down the walls of Jerusalem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive to Babylon the remnant of the people who remained in the city and those who defected to him, with the rest of the people who remained. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left in the land of Judah the poor people, who had nothing, and gave them vineyards and fields <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>at the same time.</span></p> <h3>
Jeremiah Goes Free</span></h3><p><span class="text Jer-39-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>&#8220;Take him and look after him, and do him no harm; but do to him just as he says to you.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent Nebushasban, Rabsaris, Nergal-Sharezer, Rabmag, and all the king of Babylon&#8217;s chief officers; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>then they sent <i>someone</i> to take Jeremiah from the court of the prison, and committed him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, that he should take him home. So he dwelt among the people.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Meanwhile the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had come to Jeremiah while he was shut up in the court of the prison, saying, </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>For I will surely deliver you, and you shall not fall by the sword; but your life shall be as a prize to you, because you have put your trust in Me,&#8221; says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-19926a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jeremiah 39:2">Jeremiah 39:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>city wall was breached</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-19927b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jeremiah 39:3">Jeremiah 39:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>A title, probably <i>Chief Officer;</i> also v. <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Jer.39.13" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=Jer.39.13&amp;version=NKJV">13</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-19927c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jeremiah 39:3">Jeremiah 39:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>A title, probably <i>Troop Commander;</i> also v. <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Jer.39.13" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=Jer.39.13&amp;version=NKJV">13</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-19928d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jeremiah 39:4">Jeremiah 39:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>Arabah;</i> the Jordan Valley</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-19931e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jeremiah 39:7">Jeremiah 39:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>chains</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-19934f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jeremiah 39:10">Jeremiah 39:10</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>on that day</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
