<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8220;From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, even to this day, this <i>is</i> the twenty-third year in which the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has come to me; and I have spoken to you, rising early and speaking, but you have not listened. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has sent to you all His servants the prophets, rising early and sending <i>them,</i> but you have not listened nor inclined your ear to hear. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>They said, &#8216;Repent now everyone of his evil way and his evil doings, and dwell in the land that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has given to you and your fathers forever and ever. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Do not go after other gods to serve them and worship them, and do not provoke Me to anger with the works of your hands; and I will not harm you.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Yet you have not listened to Me,&#8221; says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, &#8220;that you might provoke Me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurt.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8220;Therefore thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts: &#8216;Because you have not heard My words, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>behold, I will send and take all the families of the north,&#8217; says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, &#8216;and Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, My servant, and will bring them against this land, against its inhabitants, and against these nations all around, and will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, a hissing, and perpetual desolations. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Moreover I will <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones and the light of the lamp. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And this whole land shall be a desolation <i>and</i> an astonishment, and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>&#8216;Then it will come to pass, when <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>seventy years are completed, <i>that</i> I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation, the land of the Chaldeans, for their iniquity,&#8217; says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; &#8216;and I will make it a perpetual desolation. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So I will bring on that land all My words which I have pronounced against it, all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah has prophesied concerning all the nations. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>(For many nations and great kings shall be served by them also; and I will repay them according to their deeds and according to the works of their own hands.)&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Judgment on the Nations</span></h3><p><span class="text Jer-25-15"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>For thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel to me: &#8220;Take this wine cup of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>fury from My hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send you, to drink it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And they will drink and stagger and go mad because of the sword that I will send among them.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then I took the cup from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s hand, and made all the nations drink, to whom the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had sent me: </span>
