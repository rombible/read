<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> to me: &#8216;Make for yourselves bonds and yokes, and put them on your neck, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and send them to the king of Edom, the king of Moab, the king of the Ammonites, the king of Tyre, and the king of Sidon, by the hand of the messengers who come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And command them to say to their masters, &#8220;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts, the God of Israel&#8212;thus you shall say to your masters: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8216;I have made the earth, the man and the beast that <i>are</i> on the ground, by My great power and by My outstretched arm, and have given it to whom it seemed proper to Me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, My servant; and the beasts of the field I have also given him to serve him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So all nations shall serve him and his son and his son&#8217;s son, until the time of his land comes; and then many nations and great kings shall make him serve them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And it shall be, <i>that</i> the nation and kingdom which will not serve Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and which will not put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation I will punish,&#8217; says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, &#8216;with the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Therefore do not listen to your prophets, your diviners, your <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>dreamers, your soothsayers, or your sorcerers, who speak to you, saying, &#8220;You shall not serve the king of Babylon.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For they prophesy a lie to you, to remove you far from your land; and I will drive you out, and you will perish. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But the nations that bring their necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, I will let them remain in their own land,&#8217; says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, &#8216;and they shall till it and dwell in it.&#8217; &#8221; &#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>I also spoke to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, &#8220;Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Why will you die, you and your people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Therefore do not listen to the words of the prophets who speak to you, saying, &#8216;You shall not serve the king of Babylon,&#8217; for they prophesy a lie to you; </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Also I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, &#8220;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8216;Do not listen to the words of your prophets who prophesy to you, saying, &#8220;Behold, the vessels of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s house will now shortly be brought back from Babylon&#8221;; for they prophesy a lie to you. </span>
