<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Hear the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and say to them, &#8216;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel: &#8220;Cursed <i>is</i> the man who does not obey the words of this covenant </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>which I commanded your fathers in the day I brought them out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, &#8216;Obey My voice, and do according to all that I command you; so shall you be My people, and I will be your God,&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>that I may establish the oath which I have sworn to your fathers, to give them &#8216;a land flowing with milk and honey,&#8217; as <i>it is</i> this day.&#8221; &#8217; &#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Jer-11-5">And I answered and said, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>&#8220;So be it, <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to me, &#8220;Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying: &#8216;Hear the words of this covenant and do them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For I earnestly exhorted your fathers in the day I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, until this day, rising early and exhorting, saying, &#8220;Obey My voice.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, but everyone <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>followed the dictates of his evil heart; therefore I will bring upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded <i>them</i> to do, but <i>which</i> they have not done.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to me, &#8220;A conspiracy has been found among the men of Judah and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>They have turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers who refused to hear My words, and they have gone after other gods to serve them; the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken My covenant which I made with their fathers.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Therefore thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8220;Behold, I will surely bring calamity on them which they will not be able to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>escape; and though they cry out to Me, I will not listen to them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and cry out to the gods to whom they offer incense, but they will not save them at all in the time of their trouble. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For <i>according to</i> the number of your cities were your gods, O Judah; and <i>according to</i> the number of the streets of Jerusalem you have set up altars to <i>that</i> shameful thing, altars to burn incense to Baal.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>&#8220;So do not pray for this people, or lift up a cry or prayer for them; for I will not hear <i>them</i> in the time that they cry out to Me because of their trouble.</span></p> <div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line">
