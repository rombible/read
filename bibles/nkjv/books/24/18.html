<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then I went down to the potter&#8217;s house, and there he was, making something at the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>wheel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And the vessel that he <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>made of clay was <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>marred in the hand of the potter; so he made it again into another vessel, as it seemed good to the potter to make.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came to me, saying: </span>
