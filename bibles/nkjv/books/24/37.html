<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>But neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land gave heed to the words of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> which He spoke by the prophet Jeremiah.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, &#8220;Pray now to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God for us.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Now Jeremiah was coming and going among the people, for they had not <i>yet</i> put him in prison. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then Pharaoh&#8217;s army came up from Egypt; and when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard news of them, they departed from Jerusalem.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8220;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, &#8216;Thus you shall say to the king of Judah, who sent you to Me to inquire of Me: &#8220;Behold, Pharaoh&#8217;s army which has come up to help you will return to Egypt, to their own land. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And the Chaldeans shall come back and fight against this city, and take it and burn it with fire.&#8221; &#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8216;Do not deceive yourselves, saying, &#8220;The Chaldeans will surely depart from us,&#8221; for they will not depart. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For though you had defeated the whole army of the Chaldeans who fight against you, and there remained <i>only</i> wounded men among them, they would rise up, every man in his tent, and burn the city with fire.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Jeremiah Imprisoned</span></h3><p><span class="text Jer-37-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And it happened, when the army of the Chaldeans left <i>the siege</i> of Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh&#8217;s army, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>that Jeremiah went out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin to claim his property there among the people. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And when he was in the Gate of Benjamin, a captain of the guard <i>was</i> there whose name <i>was</i> Irijah the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he seized Jeremiah the prophet, saying, &#8220;You are defecting to the Chaldeans!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then Jeremiah said, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>&#8220;False! I am not defecting to the Chaldeans.&#8221; But he did not listen to him.</span></p><p><span class="text Jer-37-14">So Irijah seized Jeremiah and brought him to the princes. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Therefore the princes were angry with Jeremiah, and they struck him and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe. For they had made that the prison.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>When Jeremiah entered the dungeon and the cells, and Jeremiah had remained there many days, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>then Zedekiah the king sent and took him <i>out.</i> The king asked him secretly in his house, and said, &#8220;Is there <i>any</i> word from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Jer-37-17">And Jeremiah said, &#8220;There is.&#8221; Then he said, &#8220;You shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Moreover Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, &#8220;What offense have I committed against you, against your servants, or against this people, that you have put me in prison? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Where now <i>are</i> your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, &#8216;The king of Babylon will not come against you or against this land&#8217;? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Therefore please hear now, O my lord the king. Please, let my petition be accepted before you, and do not make me return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah to the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread from the bakers&#8217; street, until all the bread in the city was gone. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-19889a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jeremiah 37:14">Jeremiah 37:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>a lie</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
