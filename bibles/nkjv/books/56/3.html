<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/titus/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>to speak evil of no one, to be peaceable, gentle, showing all humility to all men. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/titus/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For we ourselves were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful and hating one another. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/titus/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But when the kindness and the love of God our Savior toward man appeared, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/titus/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/titus/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>whom He poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/titus/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>that having been justified by His grace we should become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/titus/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>This is a faithful saying, and these things I want you to affirm constantly, that those who have believed in God should be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men.</span></p> <h3>
Avoid Dissension</span></h3><p><span class="text Titus-3-9"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/titus/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But avoid foolish disputes, genealogies, contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and useless. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/titus/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Reject a divisive man after the first and second <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>admonition, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/titus/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>knowing that such a person is warped and sinning, being self-condemned.</span></p> <h3>
Final Messages</span></h3><p><span class="text Titus-3-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/titus/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/titus/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Send Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey with haste, that they may lack nothing. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/titus/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And let our <i>people</i> also learn to maintain good works, to <i>meet</i> urgent needs, that they may not be unfruitful.</span></p> <h3>
Farewell</span></h3><p><span class="text Titus-3-15"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/titus/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>All who <i>are</i> with me greet you.
