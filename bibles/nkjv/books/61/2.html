<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And many will follow their destructive ways, because of whom the way of truth will be blasphemed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>By covetousness they will exploit you with deceptive words; for a long time their judgment has not been idle, and their destruction <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>does not slumber.</span></p> <h3>
Doom of False Teachers</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Pet-2-4"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For if God did not spare the angels who sinned, but cast <i>them</i> down to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>hell and delivered <i>them</i> into chains of darkness, to be reserved for judgment; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and did not spare the ancient world, but saved Noah, <i>one of</i> eight <i>people</i>, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood on the world of the ungodly; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, condemned <i>them</i> to destruction, making <i>them</i> an example to those who afterward would live ungodly; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and delivered righteous Lot, <i>who was</i> oppressed by the filthy conduct of the wicked </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>(for that righteous man, dwelling among them, tormented <i>his</i> righteous soul from day to day by seeing and hearing <i>their</i> lawless deeds)&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span><i>then</i> the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to reserve the unjust under punishment for the day of judgment, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and especially those who walk according to the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and despise authority. <i>They are</i> presumptuous, self-willed. They are not afraid to speak evil of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>dignitaries, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>whereas angels, who are greater in power and might, do not bring a reviling accusation against them before the Lord.</span></p> <h3>
Depravity of False Teachers</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Pet-2-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But these, like natural brute beasts made to be caught and destroyed, speak evil of the things they do not understand, and will utterly perish in their own corruption, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span><i>and</i> will receive the wages of unrighteousness, <i>as</i> those who count it pleasure to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>carouse in the daytime. <i>They are</i> spots and blemishes, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>carousing in their own deceptions while they feast with you, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>having eyes full of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>adultery and that cannot cease from sin, enticing unstable souls. They have a heart trained in covetous practices, <i>and are</i> accursed children. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>They have forsaken the right way and gone astray, following the way of Balaam the <i>son</i> of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>but he was rebuked for his iniquity: a dumb donkey speaking with a man&#8217;s voice restrained the madness of the prophet.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>These are wells without water, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>clouds carried by a tempest, for whom is reserved the blackness of darkness <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>forever.</span></p> <h3>
Deceptions of False Teachers</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Pet-2-18"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>For when they speak great swelling <i>words</i> of emptiness, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through lewdness, the ones who <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>have actually escaped from those who live in error. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>While they promise them liberty, they themselves are slaves of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>corruption; for by whom a person is overcome, by him also he is brought into <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span>bondage. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>For if, after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overcome, the latter end is worse for them than the beginning. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than having known <i>it,</i> to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But it has happened to them according to the true proverb: <span class="oblique">&#8220;A dog returns to his own vomit,&#8221;</span> and, &#8220;a sow, having washed, to her wallowing in the mire.&#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-30504a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Peter 2:3">2 Peter 2:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>M <i>will not</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30505b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Peter 2:4">2 Peter 2:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Tartarus</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30511c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Peter 2:10">2 Peter 2:10</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>glorious ones,</i> lit. <i>glories</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30514d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Peter 2:13">2 Peter 2:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>revel</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30514e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Peter 2:13">2 Peter 2:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>reveling</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30515f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Peter 2:14">2 Peter 2:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>an adulteress</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30518g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Peter 2:17">2 Peter 2:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>and mists</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30518h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Peter 2:17">2 Peter 2:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>forever</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30519i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Peter 2:18">2 Peter 2:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>are barely escaping</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30520j"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Peter 2:19">2 Peter 2:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>depravity</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30520k"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Peter 2:19">2 Peter 2:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>slavery</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
