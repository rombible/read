<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>that you may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>us, the apostles of the Lord and Savior, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>knowing this first: that scoffers will come in the last days, walking according to their own lusts, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and saying, &#8220;Where is the promise of His coming? For since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as <i>they were</i> from the beginning of creation.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For this they willfully forget: that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of water and in the water, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>by which the world <i>that</i> then existed perished, being flooded with water. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But the heavens and the earth <i>which</i> are now preserved by the same word, are reserved for fire until the day of judgment and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>perdition of ungodly men.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But, beloved, do not forget this one thing, that with the Lord one day <i>is</i> as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>The Lord is not slack concerning <i>His</i> promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>us, not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance.</span></p> <h3>
The Day of the Lord</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Pet-3-10"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will melt with fervent heat; both the earth and the works that are in it will be <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>burned up. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Therefore, since all these things will be dissolved, what manner <i>of persons</i> ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be dissolved, being on fire, and the elements will melt with fervent heat? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells.</span></p> <h3>
Be Steadfast</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Pet-3-14"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Therefore, beloved, looking forward to these things, be diligent to be found by Him in peace, without spot and blameless; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and consider <i>that</i> the longsuffering of our Lord <i>is</i> salvation&#8212;as also our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given to him, has written to you, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>as also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things, in which are some things hard to understand, which untaught and unstable <i>people</i> twist to their own destruction, as <i>they do</i> also the rest of the Scriptures.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>You therefore, beloved, since you know <i>this</i> beforehand, beware lest you also fall from your own steadfastness, being led away with the error of the wicked; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</span></p><p><span class="text 2Pet-3-18">To Him <i>be</i> the glory both now and forever. Amen.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-30525a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Peter 3:2">2 Peter 3:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M <i>the apostles of your Lord and Savior</i> or <i>your apostles of the Lord and Savior</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30530b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Peter 3:7">2 Peter 3:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>destruction</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30532c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Peter 3:9">2 Peter 3:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>you</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30533d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Peter 3:10">2 Peter 3:10</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>laid bare,</i> lit. <i>found</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
