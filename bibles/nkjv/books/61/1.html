<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For he who lacks these things is shortsighted, even to blindness, and has forgotten that he was cleansed from his old sins.</span></p> <p>

The Trustworthy Prophetic Word</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Pet-1-16"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>For we did not follow cunningly devised fables when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of His majesty. </span>
