<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/36-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And they said: &#8220;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> commanded my lord <i>Moses</i> to give the land as an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel, and my lord was commanded by the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> to give the inheritance of our brother Zelophehad to his daughters. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/36-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Now if they are married to any of the sons of the <i>other</i> tribes of the children of Israel, then their inheritance will be taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and it will be added to the inheritance of the tribe into which they marry; so it will be taken from the lot of our inheritance. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/36-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And when the Jubilee of the children of Israel comes, then their inheritance will be added to the inheritance of the tribe into which they marry; so their inheritance will be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/36-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, saying: &#8220;What the tribe of the sons of Joseph speaks is right. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/36-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>This <i>is</i> what the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> commands concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, &#8216;Let them <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>marry whom they think best, but they may marry only within the family of their father&#8217;s tribe.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/36-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So the inheritance of the children of Israel shall not change hands from tribe to tribe, for every one of the children of Israel shall keep the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/36-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And every daughter who possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel shall be the wife of one of the family of her father&#8217;s tribe, so that the children of Israel each may possess the inheritance of his fathers. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/36-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Thus no inheritance shall change hands from <i>one</i> tribe to another, but every tribe of the children of Israel shall keep its own inheritance.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
