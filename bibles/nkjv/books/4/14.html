<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And all the children of Israel complained against Moses and Aaron, and the whole congregation said to them, &#8220;If only we had died in the land of Egypt! Or if only we had died in this wilderness! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Why has the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> brought us to this land to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>fall by the sword, that our wives and children should become victims? Would it not be better for us to return to Egypt?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So they said to one another, &#8220;Let us select a leader and return to Egypt.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then Moses and Aaron <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, <i>who were</i> among those who had spied out the land, tore their clothes; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and they spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying: &#8220;The land we passed through to spy out <i>is</i> an exceedingly good land. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>If the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> delights in us, then He will bring us into this land and give it to us, &#8216;a land which flows with milk and honey.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Only do not rebel against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, nor fear the people of the land, for they<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> <i>are</i> our bread; their protection has departed from them, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>is</i> with us. Do not fear them.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And all the congregation said to stone them with stones. Now the glory of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> appeared in the tabernacle of meeting before all the children of Israel.</span></p> <h3>
Moses Intercedes for the People</span></h3><p><span class="text Num-14-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses: &#8220;How long will these people reject<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span> Me? And how long will they not believe Me, with all the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>signs which I have performed among them? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>I will strike them with the pestilence and disinherit them, and I will make of you a nation greater and mightier than they.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And Moses said to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8220;Then the Egyptians will hear <i>it,</i> for by Your might You brought these people up from among them, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>and they will tell <i>it</i> to the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that You, <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, <i>are</i> among these people; that You, <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, are seen face to face and Your cloud stands above them, and You go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Now <i>if</i> You kill these people as one man, then the nations which have heard of Your fame will speak, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>&#8216;Because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was not able to bring this people to the land which He swore to give them, therefore He killed them in the wilderness.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And now, I pray, let the power of my Lord be great, just as You have spoken, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>&#8216;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> is longsuffering and abundant in mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression; but He by no means clears <i>the guilty,</i> visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth <i>generation.</i>&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Pardon the iniquity of this people, I pray, according to the greatness of Your mercy, just as You have forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said: &#8220;I have pardoned, according to your word; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>but truly, as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>because all these men who have seen My glory and the signs which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have put Me to the test now these ten times, and have not heeded My voice, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>they certainly shall not see the land of which I <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>swore to their fathers, nor shall any of those who rejected Me see it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>But My servant Caleb, because he has a different spirit in him and has followed Me fully, I will bring into the land where he went, and his descendants shall inherit it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwell in the valley; tomorrow turn and move out into the wilderness by the Way of the Red Sea.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Death Sentence on the Rebels</span></h3><p><span class="text Num-14-26"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>&#8220;How long <i>shall I bear with</i> this evil congregation who complain against Me? I have heard the complaints which the children of Israel make against Me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Say to them, &#8216;As I live,&#8217; says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, &#8216;just as you have spoken in My hearing, so I will do to you: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>The carcasses of you who have complained against Me shall fall in this wilderness, all of you who were numbered, according to your entire number, from twenty years old and above. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Except for Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun, you shall by no means enter the land which I <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>swore I would make you dwell in. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>But your little ones, whom you said would be victims, I will bring in, and they shall <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>know the land which you have despised. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>But <i>as for</i> you, your<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span> carcasses shall fall in this wilderness. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And your sons shall be <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>shepherds in the wilderness forty years, and bear the brunt of your infidelity, until your carcasses are consumed in the wilderness. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>According to the number of the days in which you spied out the land, forty days, for each day you shall bear your <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span>guilt one year, <i>namely</i> forty years, and you shall know My <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[l]</a></span>rejection. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>I the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> have spoken this. I will surely do so to all this evil congregation who are gathered together against Me. In this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Now the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned and made all the congregation complain against him by bringing a bad report of the land, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>those very men who brought the evil report about the land, died by the plague before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>But Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh remained alive, of the men who went to spy out the land.</span></p> <h3>
A Futile Invasion Attempt</span></h3><p><span class="text Num-14-39"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>Then Moses told these words to all the children of Israel, and the people mourned greatly. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>And they rose early in the morning and went up to the top of the mountain, saying, &#8220;Here we are, and we will go up to the place which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has promised, for we have sinned!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>And Moses said, &#8220;Now why do you <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[m]</a></span>transgress the command of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>? For this will not succeed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>Do not go up, lest you be defeated by your enemies, for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>is</i> not among you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>For the Amalekites and the Canaanites <i>are</i> there before you, and you shall fall by the sword; because you have turned away from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will not be with you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
