<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Take vengeance on the Midianites for the children of Israel. Afterward you shall be gathered to your people.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So Moses spoke to the people, saying, &#8220;Arm some of yourselves for war, and let them go against the Midianites to take vengeance for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> on Midian. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>A thousand from each tribe of all the tribes of Israel you shall send to the war.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So there were recruited from the divisions of Israel one thousand from <i>each</i> tribe, twelve thousand armed for war. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then Moses sent them to the war, one thousand from <i>each</i> tribe; he sent them to the war with Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, with the holy articles and the signal trumpets in his hand. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And they warred against the Midianites, just as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> commanded Moses, and they killed all the males. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>They killed the kings of Midian with <i>the rest of</i> those who were killed&#8212;Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian. Balaam the son of Beor they also killed with the sword.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And the children of Israel took the women of Midian captive, with their little ones, and took as spoil all their cattle, all their flocks, and all their goods. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>They also burned with fire all the cities where they dwelt, and all their forts. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And they took all the spoil and all the booty&#8212;of man and beast.</span></p> <h3>
Return from the War</span></h3><p><span class="text Num-31-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then they brought the captives, the booty, and the spoil to Moses, to Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of the children of Israel, to the camp in the plains of Moab by the Jordan, <i>across from</i> Jericho. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And Moses, Eleazar the priest, and all the leaders of the congregation, went to meet them outside the camp. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But Moses was angry with the officers of the army, <i>with</i> the captains over thousands and captains over hundreds, who had come from the battle.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And Moses said to them: &#8220;Have you kept all the women alive? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Look, these <i>women</i> caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to trespass against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> in the incident of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Now therefore, kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known a man intimately. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>But keep alive for yourselves all the young girls who have not known a man intimately. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And as for you, remain outside the camp seven days; whoever has killed any person, and whoever has touched any slain, purify yourselves and your captives on the third day and on the seventh day. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Purify every garment, everything made of leather, everything woven of goats&#8217; <i>hair,</i> and everything made of wood.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who had gone to the battle, &#8220;This <i>is</i> the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>ordinance of the law which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> commanded Moses: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Only the gold, the silver, the bronze, the iron, the tin, and the lead, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>everything that can endure fire, you shall put through the fire, and it shall be clean; and it shall be purified with the water of purification. But all that cannot endure fire you shall put through water. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And you shall wash your clothes on the seventh day and be clean, and afterward you may come into the camp.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Division of the Plunder</span></h3><p><span class="text Num-31-25"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Now the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying: </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>and divide the plunder into two parts, between those who took part in the war, who went out to battle, and all the congregation. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And levy a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>tribute for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> on the men of war who went out to battle: one of every five hundred of the persons, the cattle, the donkeys, and the sheep; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>take <i>it</i> from their half, and give <i>it</i> to Eleazar the priest as a heave offering to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And from the children of Israel&#8217;s half you shall take one of every fifty, drawn from the persons, the cattle, the donkeys, and the sheep, from all the livestock, and give them to the Levites who <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>keep charge of the tabernacle of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221; </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>The booty remaining from the plunder, which the men of war had taken, was six hundred and seventy-five thousand sheep, </span>
