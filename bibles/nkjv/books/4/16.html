<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and they rose up before Moses with some of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty leaders of the congregation, representatives of the congregation, men of renown. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>They gathered together against Moses and Aaron, and said to them, &#8220;<i>You</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span><i>take</i> too much upon yourselves, for all the congregation <i>is</i> holy, every one of them, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>is</i> among them. Why then do you exalt yourselves above the assembly of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So when Moses heard <i>it,</i> he fell on his face; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and he spoke to Korah and all his company, saying, &#8220;Tomorrow morning the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will show who <i>is</i> His and <i>who is</i> holy,<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span> and will cause <i>him</i> to come near to Him. That one whom He chooses He will cause to come near to Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Do this: Take censers, Korah and all your company; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>put fire in them and put incense in them before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> tomorrow, and it shall be <i>that</i> the man whom the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> chooses <i>is</i> the holy one. <i>You take</i> too much upon yourselves, you sons of Levi!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then Moses said to Korah, &#8220;Hear now, you sons of Levi: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span><i>Is it</i> a small thing to you that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to Himself, to do the work of the tabernacle of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and to stand before the congregation to serve them; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and that He has brought you near <i>to Himself,</i> you and all your brethren, the sons of Levi, with you? And are you seeking the priesthood also? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Therefore you and all your company <i>are</i> gathered together against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. And what <i>is</i> Aaron that you complain against him?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, but they said, &#8220;We will not come up! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span><i>Is it</i> a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, that you should keep acting like a prince over us? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Moreover you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you put out the eyes of these men? We will not come up!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then Moses was very angry, and said to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, &#8220;Do not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>respect their offering. I have not taken one donkey from them, nor have I hurt one of them.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And Moses said to Korah, &#8220;Tomorrow, you and all your company be present before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8212;you and they, as well as Aaron. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Let each take his censer and put incense in it, and each of you bring his censer before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, two hundred and fifty censers; both you and Aaron, each <i>with</i> his censer.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>So every man took his censer, put fire in it, laid incense on it, and stood at the door of the tabernacle of meeting with Moses and Aaron. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And Korah gathered all the congregation against them at the door of the tabernacle of meeting. Then the glory of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> appeared to all the congregation.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>&#8220;Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then they fell<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span> on their faces, and said, &#8220;O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and You be angry with all the congregation?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>&#8220;Speak to the congregation, saying, &#8216;Get away from the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then Moses rose and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And he spoke to the congregation, saying, &#8220;Depart now from the tents of these wicked men! Touch nothing of theirs, lest you be consumed in all their sins.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>So they got away from around the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram; and Dathan and Abiram came out and stood at the door of their tents, with their wives, their sons, and their little children.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And Moses said: &#8220;By this you shall know that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has sent me to do all these works, for <i>I have</i> not <i>done them</i> of my own will. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>If these men die naturally like all men, or if they are visited by the common fate of all men, <i>then</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has not sent me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>But if the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> creates a new thing, and the earth opens its mouth and swallows them up with all that belongs to them, and they go down alive into the pit, then you will understand that these men have rejected the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Now it came to pass, as he finished speaking all these words, that the ground split apart under them, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, with their households and all the men with Korah, with all <i>their</i> goods. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>So they and all those with them went down alive into the pit; the earth closed over them, and they perished from among the assembly. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Then all Israel who <i>were</i> around them fled at their cry, for they said, &#8220;Lest the earth swallow us up <i>also!</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>And a fire came out from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and consumed the two hundred and fifty men who were offering incense.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>&#8220;Tell Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, to pick up the censers out of the blaze, for they are holy, and scatter the fire some distance away. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>The censers of these men who sinned <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>against their own souls, let them be made into hammered plates as a covering for the altar. Because they presented them before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, therefore they are holy; and they shall be a sign to the children of Israel.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>So Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers, which those who were burned up had presented, and they were hammered out as a covering on the altar, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span><i>to be</i> a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>memorial to the children of Israel that no outsider, who <i>is</i> not a descendant of Aaron, should come near to offer incense before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, that he might not become like Korah and his companions, just as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had said to him through Moses.</span></p> <h3>
Complaints of the People</span></h3><p><span class="text Num-16-41"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>On the next day all the congregation of the children of Israel complained against Moses and Aaron, saying, &#8220;You have killed the people of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>Now it happened, when the congregation had gathered against Moses and Aaron, that they turned toward the tabernacle of meeting; and suddenly the cloud covered it, and the glory of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> appeared. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>Then Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of meeting.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>&#8220;Get away from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Num-16-45">And they fell on their faces.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span>So Moses said to Aaron, &#8220;Take a censer and put fire in it from the altar, put incense <i>on it,</i> and take it quickly to the congregation and make <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>atonement for them; for wrath has gone out from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. The plague has begun.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-47.htm"><b>47</b></a></span>Then Aaron took <i>it</i> as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the assembly; and already the plague had begun among the people. So he put in the incense and made atonement for the people. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-48.htm"><b>48</b></a></span>And he stood between the dead and the living; so the plague was stopped. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-49.htm"><b>49</b></a></span>Now those who died in the plague were fourteen thousand seven hundred, besides those who died in the Korah incident. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-50.htm"><b>50</b></a></span>So Aaron returned to Moses at the door of the tabernacle of meeting, for the plague had stopped.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-4198a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Numbers 16:3">Numbers 16:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>assume too much for</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-4200b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Numbers 16:5">Numbers 16:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>set aside</i> for His use only</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-4210c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Numbers 16:15">Numbers 16:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>graciously regard</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-4217d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Numbers 16:22">Numbers 16:22</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>prostrated themselves</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-4233e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Numbers 16:38">Numbers 16:38</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>at the cost of their own lives</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-4235f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Numbers 16:40">Numbers 16:40</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>reminder</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-4241g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Numbers 16:46">Numbers 16:46</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>covering</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
