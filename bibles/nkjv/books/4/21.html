Then he fought against Israel and took <i>some</i> of them prisoners. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So Israel made a vow to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and said, &#8220;If You will indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> listened to the voice of Israel and delivered up the Canaanites, and they utterly destroyed them and their cities. So the name of that place was called <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>Hormah.</span></p> <h3>
The Bronze Serpent</span></h3><p><span class="text Num-21-4"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then they journeyed from Mount Hor by the Way of the Red Sea, to go around the land of Edom; and the soul of the people became very <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>discouraged on the way. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And the people spoke against God and against Moses: &#8220;Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For <i>there is</i> no food and no water, and our soul <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>loathes this worthless bread.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and many of the people of Israel died.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, &#8220;We have sinned, for we have spoken against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and against you; pray to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> that He take away the serpents from us.&#8221; So Moses prayed for the people.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;Make a fiery <i>serpent,</i> and set it on a pole; and it shall be that everyone who is bitten, when he looks at it, shall live.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So Moses made a bronze serpent, and put it on a pole; and so it was, if a serpent had bitten anyone, when he looked at the bronze serpent, he lived.</span></p> <h3>
From Mount Hor to Moab</span></h3><p><span class="text Num-21-10"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Now the children of Israel moved on and camped in Oboth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And they journeyed from Oboth and camped at <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>Ije Abarim, in the wilderness which <i>is</i> east of Moab, toward the sunrise. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>From there they moved and camped in the Valley of Zered. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>From there they moved and camped on the other side of the Arnon, which <i>is</i> in the wilderness that extends from the border of the Amorites; for the Arnon <i>is</i> the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Therefore it is said in the Book of the Wars of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Num-21-14"><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>&#8220;Waheb in Suphah,</span><br /><span class="text Num-21-14">The brooks of the Arnon,</span><br />

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>From there <i>they went</i> to Beer, which <i>is</i> the well where the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;Gather the people together, and I will give them water.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then Israel sang this song:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Num-21-17">&#8220;Spring up, O well!</span><br /><span class="text Num-21-17">All of you sing to it&#8212;</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>The well the leaders sank,</span><br /><span class="text Num-21-18">Dug by the nation&#8217;s nobles,</span><br /><span class="text Num-21-18">By the lawgiver, with their staves.&#8221;</span></p></div><p class="top-1"><span class="text Num-21-18">And from the wilderness <i>they went</i> to Mattanah, </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>and from Bamoth, <i>in</i> the valley that <i>is</i> in the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah which looks down on the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>wasteland.</span></p> <h3>
King Sihon Defeated</span></h3><p><span class="text Num-21-21"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>&#8220;Let me pass through your land. We will not turn aside into fields or vineyards; we will not drink water from wells. We will go by the King&#8217;s Highway until we have passed through your territory.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>But Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his territory. So Sihon gathered all his people together and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>went out against Israel in the wilderness, and he came to Jahaz and fought against Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then Israel defeated him with the edge of the sword, and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, as far as the people of Ammon; for the border of the people of Ammon <i>was</i> fortified. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>So Israel took all these cities, and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon and in all its villages. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>For Heshbon <i>was</i> the city of Sihon king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and had taken all his land from his hand as far as the Arnon. </span>
