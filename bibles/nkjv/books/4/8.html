<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Speak to Aaron, and say to him, &#8216;When you arrange the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light in front of the lampstand.&#8217; &#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And Aaron did so; he arranged the lamps to face toward the front of the lampstand, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> commanded Moses. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Now this workmanship of the lampstand <i>was</i> hammered gold; from its shaft to its flowers it <i>was</i> hammered work.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then let them take a young bull with its grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil, and you shall take another young bull as a sin offering. </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/8-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8220;And you shall stand the Levites before Aaron and his sons, and then offer them <i>like</i> a wave offering to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span>
