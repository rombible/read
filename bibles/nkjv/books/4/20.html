<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Now there was no water for the congregation; so they gathered together against Moses and Aaron. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And the people contended with Moses and spoke, saying: &#8220;If only we had died when our brethren died before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Why have you brought up the assembly of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> into this wilderness, that we and our animals should die here? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And why have you made us come up out of Egypt, to bring us to this evil place? It <i>is</i> not a place of grain or figs or vines or pomegranates; nor <i>is</i> there any water to drink.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the door of the tabernacle of meeting, and they <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>fell on their faces. And the glory of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> appeared to them.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8220;Take the rod; you and your brother Aaron gather the congregation together. Speak to the rock before their eyes, and it will yield its water; thus you shall bring water for them out of the rock, and give drink to the congregation and their animals.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So Moses took the rod from before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> as He commanded him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock; and he said to them, &#8220;Hear now, you rebels! Must we bring water for you out of this rock?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then Moses lifted his hand and struck the rock twice with his rod; and water came out abundantly, and the congregation and their animals drank.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Moses and Aaron, &#8220;Because you did not believe Me, to hallow Me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>This <i>was</i> the water of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>Meribah, because the children of Israel contended with the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and He was hallowed among them.</span></p> <h3>
Passage Through Edom Refused</span></h3><p><span class="text Num-20-14"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Now Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom. &#8220;Thus says your brother Israel: &#8216;You know all the hardship that has befallen us, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>how our fathers went down to Egypt, and we dwelt in Egypt a long time, and the Egyptians <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>afflicted us and our fathers. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>When we cried out to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, He heard our voice and sent the Angel and brought us up out of Egypt; now here we are in Kadesh, a city on the edge of your border. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Please let us pass through your country. We will not pass through fields or vineyards, nor will we drink water from wells; we will go along the King&#8217;s Highway; we will not turn aside to the right hand or to the left until we have passed through your territory.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then Edom said to him, &#8220;You shall not pass through my <i>land,</i> lest I come out against you with the sword.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>So the children of Israel said to him, &#8220;We will go by the Highway, and if I or my livestock drink any of your water, then I will pay for it; let me only pass through on foot, nothing <i>more.</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then he said, &#8220;You shall not pass through.&#8221; So Edom came out against them with many men and with a strong hand. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his territory; so Israel turned away from him.</span></p> <h3>
Death of Aaron</span></h3><p><span class="text Num-20-22"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Now the children of Israel, the whole congregation, journeyed from Kadesh and came to Mount Hor. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Moses and Aaron in Mount Hor by the border of the land of Edom, saying: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>&#8220;Aaron shall <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>be gathered to his people, for he shall not enter the land which I have given to the children of Israel, because you rebelled against My word at the water of Meribah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up to Mount Hor; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>and strip Aaron of his garments and put them on Eleazar his son; for Aaron shall be gathered <i>to his people</i> and die there.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>So Moses did just as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> commanded, and they went up to Mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Moses stripped Aaron of his garments and put them on Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there on the top of the mountain. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Now when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, all the house of Israel mourned for Aaron thirty days.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-4318a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Numbers 20:6">Numbers 20:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>prostrated themselves</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-4325b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Numbers 20:13">Numbers 20:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Contention</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-4327c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Numbers 20:15">Numbers 20:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>did evil to</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-4336d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Numbers 20:24">Numbers 20:24</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Die and join his ancestors</span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
