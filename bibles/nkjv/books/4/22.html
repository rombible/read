<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Now Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And Moab was exceedingly afraid of the people because they <i>were</i> many, and Moab was sick with dread because of the children of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So Moab said to the elders of Midian, &#8220;Now this company will <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>lick up everything around us, as an ox licks up the grass of the field.&#8221; And Balak the son of Zippor <i>was</i> king of the Moabites at that time. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then he sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor at Pethor, which <i>is</i> near <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>the River in the land of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>the sons of his people, to call him, saying: &#8220;Look, a people has come from Egypt. See, they cover the face of the earth, and are settling next to me! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Therefore please come at once, curse this people for me, for they <i>are</i> too mighty for me. Perhaps I shall be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land, for I know that he whom you bless <i>is</i> blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the diviner&#8217;s fee in their hand, and they came to Balaam and spoke to him the words of Balak. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And he said to them, &#8220;Lodge here tonight, and I will bring back word to you, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> speaks to me.&#8221; So the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then God came to Balaam and said, &#8220;Who <i>are</i> these men with you?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So Balaam said to God, &#8220;Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent to me, <i>saying,</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8216;Look, a people has come out of Egypt, and they cover the face of the earth. Come now, curse them for me; perhaps I shall be able to overpower them and drive them out.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And God said to Balaam, &#8220;You shall not go with them; you shall not curse the people, for they <i>are</i> blessed.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So Balaam rose in the morning and said to the princes of Balak, &#8220;Go back to your land, for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has refused to give me permission to go with you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And the princes of Moab rose and went to Balak, and said, &#8220;Balaam refuses to come with us.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then Balak again sent princes, more numerous and more <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>honorable than they. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And they came to Balaam and said to him, &#8220;Thus says Balak the son of Zippor: &#8216;Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>for I will certainly honor you greatly, and I will do whatever you say to me. Therefore please come, curse this people for me.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, &#8220;Though Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> my God, to do less or more. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Now therefore, please, you also stay here tonight, that I may know what more the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will say to me.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And God came to Balaam at night and said to him, &#8220;If the men come to call you, rise <i>and</i> go with them; but only the word which I speak to you&#8212;that you shall do.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>So Balaam rose in the morning, saddled his donkey, and went with the princes of Moab.</span></p> <h3>
Balaam, the Donkey, and the Angel</span></h3><p><span class="text Num-22-22"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then God&#8217;s anger was aroused because he went, and the Angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> took His stand in the way as an adversary against him. And he was riding on his donkey, and his two servants <i>were</i> with him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Now the donkey saw the Angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> standing in the way with His drawn sword in His hand, and the donkey turned aside out of the way and went into the field. So Balaam struck the donkey to turn her back onto the road. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then the Angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, <i>with</i> a wall on this side and a wall on that side. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And when the donkey saw the Angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, she pushed herself against the wall and crushed Balaam&#8217;s foot against the wall; so he struck her again. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Then the Angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> went further, and stood in a narrow place where there <i>was</i> no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And when the donkey saw the Angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, she lay down under Balaam; so Balaam&#8217;s anger was aroused, and he struck the donkey with his staff.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, &#8220;What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And Balaam said to the donkey, &#8220;Because you have <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>abused me. I wish there were a sword in my hand, for now I would kill you!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>So the donkey said to Balaam, &#8220;<i>Am</i> I not your donkey on which you have ridden, ever since <i>I became</i> yours, to this day? Was I ever <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>disposed to do this to you?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Num-22-30">And he said, &#8220;No.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> opened Balaam&#8217;s eyes, and he saw the Angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> standing in the way with His drawn sword in His hand; and he bowed his head and fell flat on his face. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And the Angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to him, &#8220;Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come out <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>to stand against you, because <i>your</i> way is perverse<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span> before Me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>The donkey saw Me and turned aside from Me these three times. If she had not turned aside from Me, surely I would also have killed you by now, and let her live.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>And Balaam said to the Angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, &#8220;I have sinned, for I did not know You stood in the way against me. Now therefore, if it <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>displeases You, I will turn back.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Then the Angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Balaam, &#8220;Go with the men, but only the word that I speak to you, that you shall speak.&#8221; So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Now when Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the city of Moab, which <i>is</i> on the border at the Arnon, the boundary of the territory. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>Then Balak said to Balaam, &#8220;Did I not earnestly send to you, calling for you? Why did you not come to me? Am I not able to honor you?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>And Balaam said to Balak, &#8220;Look, I have come to you! Now, have I any power at all to say anything? The word that God puts in my mouth, that I must speak.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>So Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kirjath Huzoth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>Then Balak offered oxen and sheep, and he sent <i>some</i> to Balaam and to the princes who <i>were</i> with him.</span></p> <h3>
