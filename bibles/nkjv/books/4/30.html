<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/30-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>If a man makes a vow to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, or swears an oath to bind himself by some agreement, he shall not break his word; he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/30-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8220;Or if a woman makes a vow to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and binds <i>herself</i> by some agreement while in her father&#8217;s house in her youth, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/30-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and her father hears her vow and the agreement by which she has bound herself, and her father <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>holds his peace, then all her vows shall stand, and every agreement with which she has bound herself shall stand. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/30-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But if her father overrules her on the day that he hears, then none of her vows nor her agreements by which she has bound herself shall stand; and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will release her, because her father overruled her.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/30-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>&#8220;If indeed she takes a husband, while bound by her vows or by a rash utterance from her lips by which she bound herself, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/30-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and her husband hears <i>it,</i> and makes no response to her on the day that he hears, then her vows shall stand, and her agreements by which she bound herself shall stand. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/30-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But if her husband overrules her on the day that he hears <i>it,</i> he shall make void her vow which she took and what she uttered with her lips, by which she bound herself, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will release her.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/30-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;Also any vow of a widow or a divorced woman, by which she has bound herself, shall stand against her.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/30-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8220;If she vowed in her husband&#8217;s house, or bound herself by an agreement with an oath, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/30-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>and her husband heard <i>it,</i> and made no response to her <i>and</i> did not overrule her, then all her vows shall stand, and every agreement by which she bound herself shall stand. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/30-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But if her husband truly made them void on the day he heard <i>them,</i> then whatever proceeded from her lips concerning her vows or concerning the agreement binding her, it shall not stand; her husband has made them <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>void, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will release her. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/30-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Every vow and every binding oath to afflict her soul, her husband may confirm it, or her husband may make it void. </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/30-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But if he does make them void after he has heard <i>them,</i> then he shall bear her guilt.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
