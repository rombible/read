<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Command the children of Israel that they give the Levites cities to dwell in from the inheritance of their possession, and you shall <i>also</i> give the Levites common-land around the cities. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>They shall have the cities to dwell in; and their common-land shall be for their cattle, for their herds, and for all their animals. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>The common-land of the cities which you will give the Levites <i>shall extend</i> from the wall of the city outward a thousand cubits all around. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And you shall measure outside the city on the east side two thousand cubits, on the south side two thousand cubits, on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits. The city <i>shall be</i> in the middle. This shall belong to them as common-land for the cities.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>&#8220;Now among the cities which you will give to the Levites <i>you shall appoint</i> six cities of refuge, to which a manslayer may flee. And to these you shall add forty-two cities. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So all the cities you will give to the Levites <i>shall be</i> forty-eight; these <i>you shall give</i> with their common-land. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And the cities which you will give <i>shall be</i> from the possession of the children of Israel; from the larger <i>tribe</i> you shall give many, from the smaller you shall give few. Each shall give some of its cities to the Levites, in proportion to the inheritance that each receives.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Cities of Refuge</span></h3><p><span class="text Num-35-9"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8220;Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: &#8216;When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>then you shall appoint cities to be cities of refuge for you, that the manslayer who kills any person accidentally may flee there. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>They shall be cities of refuge for you from the avenger, that the manslayer may not die until he stands before the congregation in judgment. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And of the cities which you give, you shall have six cities of refuge. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>You shall appoint three cities on this side of the Jordan, and three cities you shall appoint in the land of Canaan, <i>which</i> will be cities of refuge. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>These six cities shall be for refuge for the children of Israel, for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them, that anyone who kills a person accidentally may flee there.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>&#8216;But if he strikes him with an iron implement, so that he dies, he <i>is</i> a murderer; the murderer shall surely be put to death. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And if he strikes him with a stone in the hand, by which one could die, and he does die, he <i>is</i> a murderer; the murderer shall surely be put to death. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Or <i>if</i> he strikes him with a wooden hand weapon, by which one could die, and he does die, he <i>is</i> a murderer; the murderer shall surely be put to death. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>The<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span> avenger of blood himself shall put the murderer to death; when he meets him, he shall put him to death. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>If he pushes him out of hatred or, while lying in wait, hurls something at him so that he dies, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>or in enmity he strikes him with his hand so that he dies, the one who struck <i>him</i> shall surely be put to death.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>&#8216;However, if he pushes him suddenly without enmity, or throws anything at him without lying in wait, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>or uses a stone, by which a man could die, throwing <i>it</i> at him without seeing <i>him,</i> so that he dies, while he was not his enemy or seeking his harm, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>then the congregation shall judge between the manslayer and the avenger of blood according to these judgments. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>So the congregation shall deliver the manslayer from the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall return him to the city of refuge where he had fled, and he shall remain there until the death of the high priest who was anointed with the holy oil. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>But if the manslayer at any time goes outside the limits of the city of refuge where he fled, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>and the avenger of blood finds him outside the limits of his city of refuge, and the avenger of blood kills the manslayer, he shall not be guilty of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>blood, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest. But after the death of the high priest the manslayer may return to the land of his possession.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>&#8216;And these <i>things</i> shall be a statute of judgment to you throughout your generations in all your dwellings. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Whoever kills a person, the murderer shall be put to death on the testimony of witnesses; but one witness is not <i>sufficient</i> testimony against a person for the death <i>penalty.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Moreover you shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer who <i>is</i> guilty of death, but he shall surely be put to death. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And you shall take no ransom for him who has fled to his city of refuge, that he may return to dwell in the land before the death of the priest. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>So you shall not pollute the land where you <i>are;</i> for blood defiles the land, and no <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>atonement can be made for the land, for the blood that is shed on it, except by the blood of him who shed it. </span>
