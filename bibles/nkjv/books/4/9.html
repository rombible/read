<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Let the children of Israel keep the Passover at its appointed time. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>On the fourteenth day of this month, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>at twilight, you shall <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>keep it at its appointed time. According to all its <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>rites and ceremonies you shall keep it.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So Moses told the children of Israel that they should keep the Passover. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month, at twilight, in the Wilderness of Sinai; according to all that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now there were <i>certain</i> men who were defiled by a human corpse, so that they could not keep the Passover on that day; and they came before Moses and Aaron that day. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And those men said to him, &#8220;We <i>became</i> defiled by a human corpse. Why are we kept from presenting the offering of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> at its appointed time among the children of Israel?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And Moses said to them, &#8220;Stand still, that I may hear what the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will command concerning you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8220;Speak to the children of Israel, saying: &#8216;If anyone of you or your <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>posterity is unclean because of a corpse, or <i>is</i> far away on a journey, he may still keep the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s Passover. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>On the fourteenth day of the second month, at twilight, they may keep it. They shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>They shall leave none of it until morning, nor break one of its bones. According to all the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>ordinances of the Passover they shall keep it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>But the man who <i>is</i> clean and is not on a journey, and ceases to keep the Passover, that same person shall be cut off from among his people, because he did not bring the offering of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> at its appointed time; that man shall bear his sin.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>&#8216;And if a stranger <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>dwells among you, and would keep the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s Passover, he must do so according to the rite of the Passover and according to its ceremony; you shall have one <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>ordinance, both for the stranger and the native of the land.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <h3>
The Cloud and the Fire</span></h3><p><span class="text Num-9-15"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Now on the day that the tabernacle was raised up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, the tent of the Testimony; from evening until morning it was above the tabernacle like the appearance of fire. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So it was always: the cloud covered it <i>by day,</i> and the appearance of fire by night. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Whenever the cloud was <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>taken up from above the tabernacle, after that the children of Israel would journey; and in the place where the cloud settled, there the children of Israel would pitch their tents. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>At the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>command of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> the children of Israel would journey, and at the command of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> they would camp; as long as the cloud stayed above the tabernacle they remained encamped. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Even when the cloud continued long, many days above the tabernacle, the children of Israel kept the charge of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and did not journey. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So it was, when the cloud was above the tabernacle a few days: according to the command of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> they would remain encamped, and according to the command of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> they would journey. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>So it was, when the cloud remained only from evening until morning: when the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they would journey; whether by day or by night, whenever the cloud was taken up, they would journey. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span><i>Whether it was</i> two days, a month, or a year that the cloud remained above the tabernacle, the children of Israel would remain encamped and not journey; but when it was taken up, they would journey. </span>
