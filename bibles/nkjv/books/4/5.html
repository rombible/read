<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>You shall put out both male and female; you shall put them outside the camp, that they may not defile their camps in the midst of which I dwell.&#8221; </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/5-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>if the spirit of jealousy comes upon him and he becomes jealous of his wife, who has defiled herself; or if the spirit of jealousy comes upon him and he becomes jealous of his wife, although she has not defiled herself&#8212; </span>
