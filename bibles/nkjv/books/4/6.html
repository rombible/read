<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>All the days that he separates himself to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> he shall not go near a dead body. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>He shall not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>make himself unclean even for his father or his mother, for his brother or his sister, when they die, because his separation to God <i>is</i> on his head. </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8216;And if anyone dies very suddenly beside him, and he defiles his consecrated head, then he shall shave his head on the day of his cleansing; on the seventh day he shall shave it. </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/6-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8216;Now this <i>is</i> the law of the Nazirite: When the days of his separation are fulfilled, he shall be brought to the door of the tabernacle of meeting. </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/6-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>and the priest shall wave them as a wave offering before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; they <i>are</i> holy for the priest, together with the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the heave offering.
