<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Send men to spy out the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the children of Israel; from each tribe of their fathers you shall send a man, every one a leader among them.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So Moses sent them from the Wilderness of Paran according to the command of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, all of them men who <i>were</i> heads of the children of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Now these <i>were</i> their names: from the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/13-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>from the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/13-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>from the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>from the tribe of Ephraim, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>Hoshea the son of Nun; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/13-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/13-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>from the tribe of Joseph, <i>that is,</i> from the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/13-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/13-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>from the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/13-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/13-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>from the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/13-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>These <i>are</i> the names of the men whom Moses sent to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>spy out the land. And Moses called Hoshea<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> the son of Nun, Joshua.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/13-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said to them, &#8220;Go up this <i>way</i> into the South, and go up to the mountains, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/13-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>and see what the land is like: whether the people who dwell in it <i>are</i> strong or weak, few or many; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/13-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>whether the land they dwell in <i>is</i> good or bad; whether the cities they inhabit <i>are</i> like camps or strongholds; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/13-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>whether the land <i>is</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>rich or poor; and whether there are forests there or not. Be of good courage. And bring some of the fruit of the land.&#8221; Now the time <i>was</i> the season of the first ripe grapes.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/13-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>So they went up and spied out the land from the Wilderness of Zin as far as Rehob, near the entrance of Hamath. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/13-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And they went up through the South and came to Hebron; Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the descendants of Anak, <i>were</i> there. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.) </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/13-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Then they came to the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>Valley of Eshcol, and there cut down a branch with one cluster of grapes; they carried it between two of them on a pole. <i>They</i> also <i>brought</i> some of the pomegranates and figs. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/13-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>The place was called the Valley of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>Eshcol, because of the cluster which the men of Israel cut down there. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/13-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And they returned from spying out the land after forty days.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/13-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Now they departed and came back to Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the children of Israel in the Wilderness of Paran, at Kadesh; they brought back word to them and to all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/13-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Then they told him, and said: &#8220;We went to the land where you sent us. It truly <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>flows with milk and honey, and this <i>is</i> its fruit. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/13-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Nevertheless the people who dwell in the land <i>are</i> strong; the cities <i>are</i> fortified <i>and</i> very large; moreover we saw the descendants of Anak there. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/13-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>The Amalekites dwell in the land of the South; the Hittites, the Jebusites, and the Amorites dwell in the mountains; and the Canaanites dwell by the sea and along the banks of the Jordan.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/13-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Then Caleb quieted the people before Moses, and said, &#8220;Let us go up at once and take possession, for we are well able to overcome it.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/13-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>But the men who had gone up with him said, &#8220;We are not able to go up against the people, for they <i>are</i> stronger than we.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/13-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And they gave the children of Israel a bad report of the land which they had spied out, saying, &#8220;The land through which we have gone as spies <i>is</i> a land that devours its inhabitants, and all the people whom we saw in it <i>are</i> men of <i>great</i> stature. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/13-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>There we saw the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>giants (the descendants of Anak came from the giants); and we were like<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span> grasshoppers in our own sight, and so we were in their sight.&#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-4084a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Numbers 13:8">Numbers 13:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'>LXX, Vg. <i>Oshea</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-4092b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Numbers 13:16">Numbers 13:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>secretly search</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-4092c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Numbers 13:16">Numbers 13:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>LXX, Vg. <i>Oshea</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-4096d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Numbers 13:20">Numbers 13:20</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>fertile or barren</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-4099e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Numbers 13:23">Numbers 13:23</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Wadi</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-4100f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Numbers 13:24">Numbers 13:24</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Cluster</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-4103g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Numbers 13:27">Numbers 13:27</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Has an abundance of food</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-4109h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Numbers 13:33">Numbers 13:33</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. <i>nephilim</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-4109i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Numbers 13:33">Numbers 13:33</span> <span class='footnote-text'>As mere insects</span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
