<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/12-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So they said, &#8220;Has the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> indeed spoken only through Moses? Has He not spoken through us also?&#8221; And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> heard <i>it.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/12-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>(Now the man Moses <i>was</i> very humble, more than all men who <i>were</i> on the face of the earth.)</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/12-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Suddenly the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, &#8220;Come out, you three, to the tabernacle of meeting!&#8221; So the three came out. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/12-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came down in the pillar of cloud and stood <i>in</i> the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam. And they both went forward. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/12-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then He said,</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Num-12-6">&#8220;Hear now My words:</span><br /><span class="text Num-12-6">If there is a prophet among you,</span><br /><span class="text Num-12-6"><i>I</i>, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, make Myself known to him in a vision;</span><br /><span class="text Num-12-6">I speak to him in a dream.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/12-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Not so with My servant Moses;</span><br /><span class="text Num-12-7">He <i>is</i> faithful in all My house.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/12-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>I speak with him face to face,</span><br /><span class="text Num-12-8">Even plainly,<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> and not in <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>dark sayings;</span><br /><span class="text Num-12-8">And he sees the form of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.</span><br /><span class="text Num-12-8">Why then were you not afraid</span><br /><span class="text Num-12-8">To speak against My servant Moses?&#8221;</span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/12-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So the anger of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was aroused against them, and He departed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/12-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And when the cloud departed from above the tabernacle, suddenly Miriam <i>became</i> leprous, as <i>white as</i> snow. Then Aaron turned toward Miriam, and there she was, a leper. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/12-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So Aaron said to Moses, &#8220;Oh, my lord! Please do not lay <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span><i>this</i> sin on us, in which we have done foolishly and in which we have sinned. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/12-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Please do not let her be as one dead, whose flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother&#8217;s womb!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/12-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So Moses cried out to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, saying, &#8220;Please heal her, O God, I pray!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/12-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;If her father had but spit in her face, would she not be shamed seven days? Let her be shut<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span> out of the camp seven days, and afterward she may be received <i>again.</i>&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/12-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So Miriam was shut out of the camp seven days, and the people did not journey till Miriam was brought in <i>again.</i> </span>
