<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/27-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And they stood before Moses, before Eleazar the priest, and before the leaders and all the congregation, <i>by</i> the doorway of the tabernacle of meeting, saying: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/27-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8220;Our father died in the wilderness; but he was not in the company of those who gathered together against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, in company with Korah, but he died in his own sin; and he had no sons. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/27-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Why should the name of our father be removed<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span> from among his family because he had no son? Give us a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>possession among our father&#8217;s brothers.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/27-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So Moses brought their case before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/27-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/27-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8220;The daughters of Zelophehad speak <i>what is</i> right; you shall surely give them a possession of inheritance among their father&#8217;s brothers, and cause the inheritance of their father to pass to them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/27-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And you shall speak to the children of Israel, saying: &#8216;If a man dies and has no son, then you shall cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/27-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>If he has no daughter, then you shall give his inheritance to his brothers. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/27-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>If he has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his father&#8217;s brothers. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/27-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And if his father has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to the relative closest to him in his family, and he shall possess it.&#8217; &#8221; And it shall be to the children of Israel a statute of judgment, just as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> commanded Moses.</span></p> <h3>
Joshua the Next Leader of Israel</span></h3><p><span class="text Num-27-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/27-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses: &#8220;Go up into this Mount Abarim, and see the land which I have given to the children of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/27-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And when you have seen it, you also shall <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother was gathered. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/27-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For in the Wilderness of Zin, during the strife of the congregation, you rebelled against My command to hallow Me at the waters before their eyes.&#8221; (These <i>are</i> the waters of Meribah, at Kadesh in the Wilderness of Zin.)</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/27-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then Moses spoke to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, saying: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/27-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>&#8220;Let the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congregation, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/27-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>who may go out before them and go in before them, who may lead them out and bring them in, that the congregation of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> may not be like sheep which have no shepherd.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/27-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses: &#8220;Take Joshua the son of Nun with you, a man in whom <i>is</i> the Spirit, and lay your hand on him; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/27-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>set him before Eleazar the priest and before all the congregation, and inaugurate<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span> him in their sight. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/27-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And you shall give <i>some</i> of your authority to him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/27-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>He shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall inquire before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> for him by the judgment of the Urim. At his word they shall go out, and at his word they shall come in, he and all the children of Israel with him&#8212;all the congregation.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/27-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So Moses did as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> commanded him.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/27-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And he laid his hands on him and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>inaugurated him, just as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> commanded by the hand of Moses.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-4559a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Numbers 27:4">Numbers 27:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>withdrawn</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-4559b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Numbers 27:4">Numbers 27:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>inheritance</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-4568c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Numbers 27:13">Numbers 27:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Die and join your ancestors</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-4574d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Numbers 27:19">Numbers 27:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>commission</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-4578e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Numbers 27:23">Numbers 27:23</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>commissioned</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
