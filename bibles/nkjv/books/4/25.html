<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>They invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods, and the people ate and bowed down to their gods. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So Israel was joined to Baal of Peor, and the anger of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was aroused against Israel.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;Take all the leaders of the people and hang the offenders before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, out in the sun, that the fierce anger of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> may turn away from Israel.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So Moses said to the judges of Israel, &#8220;Every one of you kill his men who were joined to Baal of Peor.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And indeed, one of the children of Israel came and presented to his brethren a Midianite woman in the sight of Moses and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who <i>were</i> weeping at the door of the tabernacle of meeting. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now when Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw <i>it,</i> he rose from among the congregation and took a javelin in his hand; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>and he went after the man of Israel into the tent and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her body. So the plague was stopped among the children of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And those who died in the plague were twenty-four thousand.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8220;Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned back My wrath from the children of Israel, because he was zealous with My zeal among them, so that I did not consume the children of Israel in My zeal. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Therefore say, &#8216;Behold, I give to him My covenant of peace; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>and it shall be to him and his descendants after him a covenant of an everlasting priesthood, because he was zealous for his God, and made <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>atonement for the children of Israel.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Now the name of the Israelite who was killed, who was killed with the Midianite woman, <i>was</i> Zimri the son of Salu, a leader of a father&#8217;s house among the Simeonites. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And the name of the Midianite woman who was killed <i>was</i> Cozbi the daughter of Zur; he <i>was</i> head of the people of a father&#8217;s house in Midian.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying: </span>
