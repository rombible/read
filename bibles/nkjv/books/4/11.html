So the fire of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> burned among them, and consumed <i>some</i> in the outskirts of the camp. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then the people cried out to Moses, and when Moses prayed to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, the fire was <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>quenched. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So he called the name of the place <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>Taberah, because the fire of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had burned among them.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Now the mixed multitude who were among them <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>yielded to intense craving; so the children of Israel also wept again and said: &#8220;Who will give us meat to eat? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>We remember the fish which we ate freely in Egypt, the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>but now our whole being <i>is</i> dried up; <i>there is</i> nothing at all except this manna <i>before</i> our eyes!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now the manna <i>was</i> like coriander seed, and its color like the color of bdellium. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>The people went about and gathered <i>it,</i> ground <i>it</i> on millstones or beat <i>it</i> in the mortar, cooked <i>it</i> in pans, and made cakes of it; and its taste was like the taste of pastry prepared with oil. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And when the dew fell on the camp in the night, the manna fell on it.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, everyone at the door of his tent; and the anger of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was greatly aroused; Moses also was displeased. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So Moses said to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, &#8220;Why have You afflicted Your servant? And why have I not found favor in Your sight, that You have laid the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>burden of all these people on me? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Did I conceive all these people? Did I beget them, that You should say to me, &#8216;Carry them in your bosom, as a guardian carries a nursing child,&#8217; to the land which You swore<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span> to their fathers? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Where am I to get meat to give to all these people? For they weep all over me, saying, &#8216;Give us meat, that we may eat.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>I am not able to bear all these people alone, because the burden <i>is</i> too heavy for me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>If You treat me like this, please kill me here and now&#8212;if I have found favor in Your sight&#8212;and do not let me see my wretchedness!&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
The Seventy Elders</span></h3><p><span class="text Num-11-16"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses: &#8220;Gather to Me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people and officers over them; bring them to the tabernacle of meeting, that they may stand there with you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then I will come down and talk with you there. I will take of the Spirit that <i>is</i> upon you and will put <i>the same</i> upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, that you may not bear <i>it</i> yourself alone. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then you shall say to the people, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>&#8216;Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, and you shall eat meat; for you have wept in the hearing of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, saying, &#8220;Who will give us meat to eat? For <i>it was</i> well with us in Egypt.&#8221; Therefore the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will give you meat, and you shall eat. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>You shall eat, not one day, nor two days, nor five days, nor ten days, nor twenty days, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>but <i>for</i> a whole month, until it comes out of your nostrils and becomes loathsome to you, because you have despised the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> who is among you, and have wept before Him, saying, &#8220;Why did we ever come up out of Egypt?&#8221; &#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And Moses said, &#8220;The people whom I <i>am</i> among <i>are</i> six hundred thousand men on foot; yet You have said, &#8216;I will give them meat, that they may eat <i>for</i> a whole month.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, to provide enough for them? Or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to provide enough for them?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;Has<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s arm been shortened? Now you shall see whether what I say will happen to you or not.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>So Moses went out and told the people the words of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and he gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people and placed them around the tabernacle. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came down in the cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the Spirit that <i>was</i> upon him, and placed <i>the same</i> upon the seventy elders; and it happened, when the Spirit rested upon them, that they prophesied, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>although they never did <i>so</i> again.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>But two men had remained in the camp: the name of one <i>was</i> Eldad, and the name of the other Medad. And the Spirit rested upon them. Now they <i>were</i> among those listed, but who had not gone out to the tabernacle; yet they prophesied in the camp. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And a young man ran and told Moses, and said, &#8220;Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>So Joshua the son of Nun, Moses&#8217; assistant, <i>one</i> of his choice men, answered and said, &#8220;Moses my lord, forbid them!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Then Moses said to him, &#8220;Are you <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>zealous for my sake? Oh, that all the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s people were prophets <i>and</i> that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> would put His Spirit upon them!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And Moses returned to the camp, he and the elders of Israel.</span></p> <h3>
The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> Sends Quail</span></h3><p><span class="text Num-11-31"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Now a wind went out from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and it brought quail from the sea and left <i>them</i> fluttering near the camp, about a day&#8217;s journey on this side and about a day&#8217;s journey on the other side, all around the camp, and about two cubits above the surface of the ground. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And the people stayed up all that day, all night, and all the next day, and gathered the quail (he who gathered least gathered ten homers); and they spread <i>them</i> out for themselves all around the camp. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>But while the meat <i>was</i> still between their teeth, before it was chewed, the wrath of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was aroused against the people, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> struck the people with a very great plague. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>So he called the name of that place <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>Kibroth Hattaavah, because there they buried the people who had yielded to craving.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>From Kibroth Hattaavah the people moved to Hazeroth, and camped at Hazeroth.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-4027a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Numbers 11:2">Numbers 11:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>extinguished</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-4028b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Numbers 11:3">Numbers 11:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Burning</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-4029c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Numbers 11:4">Numbers 11:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>lusted intensely</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-4036d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Numbers 11:11">Numbers 11:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>responsibility</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-4037e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Numbers 11:12">Numbers 11:12</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>solemnly promised</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-4043f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Numbers 11:18">Numbers 11:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Set yourselves apart</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-4048g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Numbers 11:23">Numbers 11:23</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Is the <span class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s power limited?</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-4050h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Numbers 11:25">Numbers 11:25</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Tg., Vg. <i>and they did not cease</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-4054i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Numbers 11:29">Numbers 11:29</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>jealous</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-4059j"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Numbers 11:34">Numbers 11:34</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Graves of Craving</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
