<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Make two silver trumpets for yourself; you shall make them of hammered work; you shall use them for calling the congregation and for directing the movement of the camps. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>When they blow both of them, all the congregation shall gather before you at the door of the tabernacle of meeting. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But if they blow <i>only</i> one, then the leaders, the heads of the divisions of Israel, shall gather to you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>When you sound the advance, the camps that lie on the east side shall then begin their journey. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>When you sound the advance the second time, then the camps that lie on the south side shall begin their journey; they shall sound the call for them to begin their journeys. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And when the assembly is to be gathered together, you shall blow, but not sound the advance. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>The sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets; and these shall be to you as an <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>ordinance forever throughout your generations.</span></p> <p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Also in the day of your gladness, in your appointed feasts, and at the beginning of your months, you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; and they shall be a memorial for you before your God: I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Departure from Sinai</span></h3><p><span class="text Num-10-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now it came to pass on the twentieth <i>day</i> of the second month, in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from above the tabernacle of the Testimony. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And the children of Israel set out from the Wilderness of Sinai on their journeys; then the cloud settled down in the Wilderness of Paran. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So they started out for the first time according to the command of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> by the hand of Moses.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>The <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>standard of the camp of the children of Judah set out first according to their armies; over their army was Nahshon the son of Amminadab. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Over the army of the tribe of the children of Issachar <i>was</i> Nethanel the son of Zuar. </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari set out, carrying the tabernacle.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And the standard of the camp of Reuben set out according to their armies; over their army <i>was</i> Elizur the son of Shedeur. </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And over the army of the tribe of the children of Gad <i>was</i> Eliasaph the son of Deuel.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then the Kohathites set out, carrying the holy things. (The tabernacle would be <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>prepared for their arrival.)</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set out according to their armies; over their army <i>was</i> Elishama the son of Ammihud. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Over the army of the tribe of the children of Manasseh <i>was</i> Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur. </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then the standard of the camp of the children of Dan (the rear guard of all the camps) set out according to their armies; over their army <i>was</i> Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Over the army of the tribe of the children of Asher <i>was</i> Pagiel the son of Ocran. </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Thus <i>was</i> the order of march of the children of Israel, according to their armies, when they began their journey.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Now Moses said to Hobab the son of Reuel<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span> the Midianite, Moses&#8217; father-in-law, &#8220;We are setting out for the place of which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said, &#8216;I will give it to you.&#8217; Come with us, and we will treat you well; for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has promised good things to Israel.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And he said to him, &#8220;I will not go, but I will depart to my <i>own</i> land and to my relatives.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>So <i>Moses</i> said, &#8220;Please do not leave, inasmuch as you know how we are to camp in the wilderness, and you can <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>be our eyes. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And it shall be, if you go with us&#8212;indeed it shall be&#8212;that whatever good the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will do to us, the same we will do to you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>So they departed from the mountain of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> on a journey of three days; and the ark of the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> went before them for the three days&#8217; journey, to search out a resting place for them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>And the cloud of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>was</i> above them by day when they went out from the camp.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>So it was, whenever the ark set out, that Moses said:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Num-10-35">&#8220;Rise up, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>!</span><br /><span class="text Num-10-35">Let Your enemies be scattered,</span><br /><span class="text Num-10-35">And let those who hate You flee before You.&#8221;</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none top-1">
