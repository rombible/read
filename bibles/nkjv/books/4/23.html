<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/23-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Balak did just as Balaam had spoken, and Balak and Balaam offered a bull and a ram on <i>each</i> altar. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/23-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then Balaam said to Balak, &#8220;Stand by your burnt offering, and I will go; perhaps the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will come to meet me, and whatever He shows me I will tell you.&#8221; So he went to a desolate height. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/23-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And God met Balaam, and he said to Him, &#8220;I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered on <i>each</i> altar a bull and a ram.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/23-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> put a word in Balaam&#8217;s mouth, and said, &#8220;Return to Balak, and thus you shall speak.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/23-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So he returned to him, and there he was, standing by his burnt offering, he and all the princes of Moab.</span></p> <p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/23-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then Balak said to Balaam, &#8220;What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and look, you have blessed <i>them</i> bountifully!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/23-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So he answered and said, &#8220;Must I not take heed to speak what the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has put in my mouth?&#8221;</span></p> <h3>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/23-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So he brought him to the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bull and a ram on <i>each</i> altar.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/23-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And he said to Balak, &#8220;Stand here by your burnt offering while I <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>meet <i>the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span></i> over there.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
