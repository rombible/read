<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>the children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spoke to Moses, to Eleazar the priest, and to the leaders of the congregation, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8220;Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Shebam, Nebo, and Beon, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>the country which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> defeated before the congregation of Israel, <i>is</i> a land for livestock, and your servants have livestock.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Therefore they said, &#8220;If we have found favor in your sight, let this land be given to your servants as a possession. Do not take us over the Jordan.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And Moses said to the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben: &#8220;Shall your brethren go to war while you sit here? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now why will you discourage the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has given them? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Thus your fathers did when I sent them away from Kadesh Barnea to see the land. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For when they went up to the Valley of Eshcol and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, so that they did not go into the land which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had given them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s anger was aroused on that day, and He swore an oath, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8216;Surely none of the men who came up from Egypt, from twenty years old and above, shall see the land of which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, because they have not wholly followed Me, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>except Caleb the son of Jephunneh, the Kenizzite, and Joshua the son of Nun, for they have wholly followed the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s anger was aroused against Israel, and He made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation that had done evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was gone. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And look! You have risen in your fathers&#8217; place, a brood of sinful men, to increase still more the fierce anger of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> against Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>For if you turn away from following Him, He will once again leave them in the wilderness, and you will destroy all these people.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then they came near to him and said: &#8220;We will build sheepfolds here for our livestock, and cities for our little ones, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>but we ourselves will be armed, ready <i>to go</i> before the children of Israel until we have brought them to their place; and our little ones will dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>We will not return to our homes until every one of the children of Israel has <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>received his inheritance. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan and beyond, because our inheritance has fallen to us on this eastern side of the Jordan.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then Moses said to them: &#8220;If you do this thing, if you arm yourselves before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> for the war, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>and all your armed men cross over the Jordan before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> until He has driven out His enemies from before Him, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>and the land is subdued before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, then afterward you may return and be blameless before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and before Israel; and this land shall be your possession before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>But if you do not do so, then take note, you have sinned against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; and be sure your sin will find you out. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Build cities for your little ones and folds for your sheep, and do <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>what has proceeded out of your mouth.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying: &#8220;Your servants will do as my lord commands. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our livestock will be there in the cities of Gilead; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>but your servants will cross over, every man armed for war, before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> to battle, just as my lord says.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>So Moses gave command concerning them to Eleazar the priest, to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And Moses said to them: &#8220;If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben cross over the Jordan with you, every man armed for battle before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and the land is subdued before you, then you shall give them the land of Gilead as a possession. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>But if they do not cross over armed with you, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Then the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying: &#8220;As the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has said to your servants, so we will do. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>We will cross over armed before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> into the land of Canaan, but the possession of our inheritance <i>shall remain</i> with us on this side of the Jordan.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>So Moses gave to the children of Gad, to the children of Reuben, and to half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land with its cities within the borders, the cities of the surrounding country. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>And the children of Gad built Dibon and Ataroth and Aroer, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Atroth and Shophan and Jazer and Jogbehah, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Beth Nimrah and Beth Haran, fortified cities, and folds for sheep. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>And the children of Reuben built Heshbon and Elealeh and Kirjathaim, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>Nebo and Baal Meon (<i>their</i> names being changed) and Shibmah; and they gave <i>other</i> names to the cities which they built.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead and took it, and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>dispossessed the Amorites who <i>were</i> in it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>So Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh, and he dwelt in it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>Also Jair the son of Manasseh went and took its small towns, and called them Havoth Jair.<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>Then Nobah went and took Kenath and its villages, and he called it Nobah, after his own name.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-4737a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Numbers 32:18">Numbers 32:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>possessed</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-4743b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Numbers 32:24">Numbers 32:24</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>what you said you would do</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-4758c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Numbers 32:39">Numbers 32:39</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>drove out</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-4760d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Numbers 32:41">Numbers 32:41</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Towns of Jair</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
