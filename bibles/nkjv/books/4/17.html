<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/17-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Speak to the children of Israel, and get from them a rod from each father&#8217;s house, all their leaders according to their fathers&#8217; houses&#8212;twelve rods. Write each man&#8217;s name on his rod. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/17-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And you shall write Aaron&#8217;s name on the rod of Levi. For there shall be one rod for the head of <i>each</i> father&#8217;s house. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/17-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then you shall place them in the tabernacle of meeting before the Testimony, where I meet with you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/17-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And it shall be <i>that</i> the rod of the man whom I choose will blossom; thus I will rid Myself of the complaints of the children of Israel, which they make against you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/17-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So Moses spoke to the children of Israel, and each of their leaders gave him a rod apiece, for each leader according to their fathers&#8217; houses, twelve rods; and the rod of Aaron <i>was</i> among their rods. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/17-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And Moses placed the rods before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> in the tabernacle of witness.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/17-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Now it came to pass on the next day that Moses went into the tabernacle of witness, and behold, the rod of Aaron, of the house of Levi, had sprouted and put forth buds, had produced blossoms and yielded ripe almonds. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/17-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then Moses brought out all the rods from before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> to all the children of Israel; and they looked, and each man took his rod.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/17-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;Bring Aaron&#8217;s rod back before the Testimony, to be kept as a sign against the rebels, that you may put their complaints away from Me, lest they die.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/17-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Thus did Moses; just as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had commanded him, so he did.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/17-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So the children of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, &#8220;Surely we die, we perish, we all perish! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/17-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Whoever even comes near the tabernacle of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> must die. Shall we all utterly die?&#8221;</span></p> </div></div></body></html>
