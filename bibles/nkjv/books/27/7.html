Then he wrote down the dream, telling <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>the main facts.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Daniel spoke, saying, &#8220;I saw in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven were stirring up the Great Sea. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And four great beasts came up from the sea, each different from the other. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>The first <i>was</i> like a lion, and had eagle&#8217;s wings. I watched till its wings were plucked off; and it was lifted up from the earth and made to stand on two feet like a man, and a man&#8217;s heart was given to it.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8220;And suddenly another beast, a second, like a bear. It was raised up on one side, and <i>had</i> three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. And they said thus to it: &#8216;Arise, devour much flesh!&#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>&#8220;After this I looked, and there was another, like a leopard, which had on its back four wings of a bird. The beast also had four heads, and dominion was given to it.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8220;After this I saw in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, exceedingly strong. It had huge iron teeth; it was devouring, breaking in pieces, and trampling the residue with its feet. It <i>was</i> different from all the beasts that <i>were</i> before it, and it had ten horns. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>I was considering the horns, and there was another horn, a little one, coming up among them, before whom three of the first horns were plucked out by the roots. And there, in this horn, <i>were</i> eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>pompous words.</span></p> <h3>
Vision of the Ancient of Days</span></h3><div class="poetry"><p class="line"><span class="text Dan-7-9"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;I watched till thrones were <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>put in place,</span><br /><span class="text Dan-7-9">And the Ancient of Days was seated;</span><br /><span class="text Dan-7-9">His garment <i>was</i> white as snow,</span><br /><span class="text Dan-7-9">And the hair of His head <i>was</i> like pure wool.</span><br /><span class="text Dan-7-9">His throne <i>was</i> a fiery flame,</span><br /><span class="text Dan-7-9">Its wheels a burning fire;</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>A fiery stream issued</span><br /><span class="text Dan-7-10">And came forth from before Him.</span><br /><span class="text Dan-7-10">A thousand thousands ministered to Him;</span><br /><span class="text Dan-7-10">Ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him.</span><br /><span class="text Dan-7-10">The <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>court was seated,</span><br /><span class="text Dan-7-10">And the books were opened.</span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8220;I watched then because of the sound of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>pompous words which the horn was speaking; I watched till the beast was slain, and its body destroyed and given to the burning flame. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>As for the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away, yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.</span></p> <div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8220;I was watching in the night visions,</span><br /><span class="text Dan-7-13">And behold, <i>One</i> like the Son of Man,</span><br /><span class="text Dan-7-13">Coming with the clouds of heaven!</span><br /><span class="text Dan-7-13">He came to the Ancient of Days,</span><br /><span class="text Dan-7-13">And they brought Him near before Him.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then to Him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom,</span><br /><span class="text Dan-7-14">That all peoples, nations, and languages should serve Him.</span><br /><span class="text Dan-7-14">His dominion <i>is</i> an everlasting dominion,</span><br /><span class="text Dan-7-14">Which shall not pass away,</span><br /><span class="text Dan-7-14">And His kingdom <i>the one</i></span><br /><span class="text Dan-7-14">Which shall not be destroyed.</span></p></div> <h3>
Daniel&#8217;s Visions Interpreted</span></h3><p><span class="text Dan-7-15"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>&#8220;I, Daniel, was grieved in my spirit <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>within <i>my</i> body, and the visions of my head troubled me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>I came near to one of those who stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me and made known to me the interpretation of these things: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>&#8216;Those great beasts, which are four, <i>are</i> four <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>kings <i>which</i> arise out of the earth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom forever, even forever and ever.&#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>&#8220;Then I wished to know the truth about the fourth beast, which was different from all the others, exceedingly dreadful, <i>with</i> its teeth of iron and its nails of bronze, <i>which</i> devoured, broke in pieces, and trampled the residue with its feet; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>and the ten horns that <i>were</i> on its head, and the other <i>horn</i> which came up, before which three fell, namely, that horn which had eyes and a mouth which spoke <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>pompous words, whose appearance <i>was</i> greater than his fellows.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>&#8220;I was watching; and the same horn was making war against the saints, and prevailing against them, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>until the Ancient of Days came, and a judgment was made <i>in favor</i> of the saints of the Most High, and the time came for the saints to possess the kingdom.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>&#8220;Thus he said:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Dan-7-23">&#8216;The fourth beast shall be</span><br /><span class="text Dan-7-23">A fourth kingdom on earth,</span><br /><span class="text Dan-7-23">Which shall be different from all <i>other</i> kingdoms,</span><br /><span class="text Dan-7-23">And shall devour the whole earth,</span><br /><span class="text Dan-7-23">Trample it and break it in pieces.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>The ten horns <i>are</i> ten kings</span><br /><span class="text Dan-7-24"><i>Who</i> shall arise from this kingdom.</span><br /><span class="text Dan-7-24">And another shall rise after them;</span><br /><span class="text Dan-7-24">He shall be different from the first <i>ones,</i></span><br /><span class="text Dan-7-24">And shall subdue three kings.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>He shall speak <i>pompous</i> words against the Most High,</span><br /><span class="text Dan-7-25">Shall persecute<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span> the saints of the Most High,</span><br /><span class="text Dan-7-25">And shall intend to change times and law.</span><br /><span class="text Dan-7-25">Then <i>the saints</i> shall be given into his hand</span><br /><span class="text Dan-7-25">For a time and times and half a time.</span></p></div> <div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>&#8216;But the court shall be seated,</span><br /><span class="text Dan-7-26">And they shall take away his dominion,</span><br /><span class="text Dan-7-26">To consume and destroy <i>it</i> forever.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Then the kingdom and dominion,</span><br /><span class="text Dan-7-27">And the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven,</span><br /><span class="text Dan-7-27">Shall be given to the people, the saints of the Most High.</span><br /><span class="text Dan-7-27">His kingdom <i>is</i> an everlasting kingdom,</span><br /><span class="text Dan-7-27">And all dominions shall serve and obey Him.&#8217;</span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
