He set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And King Nebuchadnezzar sent <i>word</i> to gather together the satraps, the administrators, the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So the satraps, the administrators, the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces gathered together for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then a herald cried <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>aloud: &#8220;To you it is commanded, O peoples, nations, and languages, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span><i>that</i> at the time you hear the sound of the horn, flute, harp, lyre, <i>and</i> psaltery, in symphony with all kinds of music, you shall fall down and worship the gold image that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and whoever does not fall down and worship shall be cast immediately into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the horn, flute, harp, <i>and</i> lyre, in symphony with all kinds of music, all the people, nations, and languages fell down <i>and</i> worshiped the gold image which King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</span></p> <h3>
Daniel&#8217;s Friends Disobey the King</span></h3><p><span class="text Dan-3-8"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Therefore at that time certain Chaldeans came forward and accused the Jews. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>They spoke and said to King Nebuchadnezzar, &#8220;O king, live forever! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>You, O king, have made a decree that everyone who hears the sound of the horn, flute, harp, lyre, <i>and</i> psaltery, in symphony with all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the gold image; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>and whoever does not fall down and worship shall be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>There are certain Jews whom you have set over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego; these men, O king, have not paid due regard to you. They do not serve your gods or worship the gold image which you have set up.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then Nebuchadnezzar, in rage and fury, gave the command to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego. So they brought these men before the king. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Nebuchadnezzar spoke, saying to them, &#8220;<i>Is it</i> true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, <i>that</i> you do not serve my gods or worship the gold image which I have set up? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Now if you are ready at the time you hear the sound of the horn, flute, harp, lyre, <i>and</i> psaltery, in symphony with all kinds of music, and you fall down and worship the image which I have made, <i>good!</i> But if you do not worship, you shall be cast immediately into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. And who <i>is</i> the god who will deliver you from my hands?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/3-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego answered and said to the king, &#8220;O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>If that <i>is the case,</i> our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver <i>us</i> from your hand, O king. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/3-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we do not serve your gods, nor will we worship the gold image which you have set up.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Saved in Fiery Trial</span></h3><p><span class="text Dan-3-19"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/3-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then Nebuchadnezzar was full of fury, and the expression on his face changed toward Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego. He spoke and commanded that they heat the furnace seven times more than it was usually heated. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/3-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And he commanded certain mighty men of valor who <i>were</i> in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, <i>and</i> cast <i>them</i> into the burning fiery furnace. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/3-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then these men were bound in their coats, their trousers, their turbans, and their <i>other</i> garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/3-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Therefore, because the king&#8217;s command was <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>urgent, and the furnace exceedingly hot, the flame of the fire killed those men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/3-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/3-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then King Nebuchadnezzar was astonished; and he rose in haste <i>and</i> spoke, saying to his <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>counselors, &#8220;Did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Dan-3-24">They answered and said to the king, &#8220;True, O king.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/3-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>&#8220;Look!&#8221; he answered, &#8220;I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire; and they are not hurt, and the form of the fourth is like the<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span> Son of God.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Nebuchadnezzar Praises God</span></h3><p><span class="text Dan-3-26"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/3-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Then Nebuchadnezzar went near the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>mouth of the burning fiery furnace <i>and</i> spoke, saying, &#8220;Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, servants of the Most High God, come out, and come <i>here.</i>&#8221; Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego came from the midst of the fire. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/3-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And the satraps, administrators, governors, and the king&#8217;s counselors gathered together, and they saw these men on whose bodies the fire had no power; the hair of their head was not singed nor were their garments affected, and the smell of fire was not on them.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/3-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Nebuchadnezzar spoke, saying, &#8220;Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, who sent His Angel<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span> and delivered His servants who trusted in Him, and they have frustrated the king&#8217;s word, and yielded their bodies, that they should not serve nor worship any god except their own God! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/3-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Therefore I make a decree that any people, nation, or language which speaks anything amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made an ash heap; because there is no other God who can deliver like this.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/3-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Then the king <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego in the province of Babylon.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-21809a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Daniel 3:1">Daniel 3:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>About 90 feet</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-21812b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Daniel 3:4">Daniel 3:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>with strength</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-21830c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Daniel 3:22">Daniel 3:22</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>harsh</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-21832d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Daniel 3:24">Daniel 3:24</span> <span class='footnote-text'>High officials</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-21833e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Daniel 3:25">Daniel 3:25</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>a son of the gods</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-21834f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Daniel 3:26">Daniel 3:26</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>door</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-21836g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Daniel 3:28">Daniel 3:28</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>angel</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-21838h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Daniel 3:30">Daniel 3:30</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>caused to prosper</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
