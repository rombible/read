The message <i>was</i> true, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>but the appointed time <i>was</i> long; and he understood the message, and had understanding of the vision. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>In those days I, Daniel, was mourning three full weeks. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>I ate no <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>pleasant food, no meat or wine came into my mouth, nor did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Now on the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, that <i>is,</i> the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Tigris, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>I lifted my eyes and looked, and behold, a certain man clothed in linen, whose waist <i>was</i> girded with gold of Uphaz! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>His body <i>was</i> like beryl, his face like the appearance of lightning, his eyes like torches of fire, his arms and feet like burnished bronze in color, and the sound of his words like the voice of a multitude.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision, for the men who were with me did not see the vision; but a great terror fell upon them, so that they fled to hide themselves. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Therefore I was left alone when I saw this great vision, and no strength remained in me; for my <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>vigor was turned to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>frailty in me, and I retained no strength. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Yet I heard the sound of his words; and while I heard the sound of his words I was in a deep sleep on my face, with my face to the ground.</span></p> <h3>
Prophecies Concerning Persia and Greece</span></h3><p><span class="text Dan-10-10"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Suddenly, a hand touched me, which made me tremble on my knees and <i>on</i> the palms of my hands. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And he said to me, &#8220;O Daniel, man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak to you, and stand upright, for I have now been sent to you.&#8221; While he was speaking this word to me, I stood trembling.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then he said to me, &#8220;Do not fear, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart to understand, and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard; and I have come because of your words. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty-one days; and behold, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, for I had been left alone there with the kings of Persia. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Now I have come to make you understand what will happen to your people in the latter days, for the vision <i>refers</i> to <i>many</i> days yet <i>to come.</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>When he had spoken such words to me, I <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>turned my face toward the ground and became speechless. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And suddenly, <i>one</i> having the likeness of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>sons of men touched my lips; then I opened my mouth and spoke, saying to him who stood before me, &#8220;My lord, because of the vision my sorrows have <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>overwhelmed me, and I have retained no strength. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>For how can this servant of my lord talk with you, my lord? As for me, no strength remains in me now, nor is any breath left in me.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then again, <i>the one</i> having the likeness of a man touched me and strengthened me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;O man greatly beloved, fear not! Peace <i>be</i> to you; be strong, yes, be strong!&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Dan-10-19">So when he spoke to me I was strengthened, and said, &#8220;Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened me.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then he said, &#8220;Do you know why I have come to you? And now I must return to fight with the prince of Persia; and when I have gone forth, indeed the prince of Greece will come. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>But I will tell you what is noted in the Scripture of Truth. (No one upholds me against these, except Michael your prince.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-22017a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Daniel 10:1">Daniel 10:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>and of great conflict;</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-22019b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Daniel 10:3">Daniel 10:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>desirable</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-22020c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Daniel 10:4">Daniel 10:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. <i>Hiddekel</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-22024d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Daniel 10:8">Daniel 10:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>splendor</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-22024e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Daniel 10:8">Daniel 10:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>ruin</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-22031f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Daniel 10:15">Daniel 10:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>set</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-22032g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Daniel 10:16">Daniel 10:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Theodotion, Vg. <i>the son;</i> LXX <i>a hand</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-22032h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Daniel 10:16">Daniel 10:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>turned upon</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
