<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>I saw in the vision, and it so happened while I was looking, that I <i>was</i> in Shushan,<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span> the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>citadel, which <i>is</i> in the province of Elam; and I saw in the vision that I was by the River Ulai. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then I lifted my eyes and saw, and there, standing beside the river, was a ram which had two horns, and the two horns <i>were</i> high; but one <i>was</i> higher than the other, and the higher <i>one</i> came up last. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>I saw the ram pushing westward, northward, and southward, so that no animal could <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>withstand him; nor <i>was there any</i> that could deliver from his hand, but he did according to his will and became great.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And as I was considering, suddenly a male goat came from the west, across the surface of the whole earth, without touching the ground; and the goat <i>had</i> a notable horn between his eyes. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen standing beside the river, and ran at him with furious power. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And I saw him confronting the ram; he was moved with rage against him, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>attacked the ram, and broke his two horns. There was no power in the ram to withstand him, but he cast him down to the ground and trampled him; and there was no one that could deliver the ram from his hand.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Therefore the male goat grew very great; but when he became strong, the large horn was broken, and in place of it four notable ones came up toward the four winds of heaven. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And out of one of them came a little horn which grew exceedingly great toward the south, toward the east, and toward the Glorious <i>Land.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And it grew up to the host of heaven; and it cast down <i>some</i> of the host and <i>some</i> of the stars to the ground, and trampled them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>He even exalted <i>himself</i> as high as the Prince of the host; and by him the daily <i>sacrifices</i> were taken away, and the place of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>His sanctuary was cast down. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Because of transgression, an army was given over <i>to the horn</i> to oppose the daily <i>sacrifices;</i> and he cast truth down to the ground. He did <i>all this</i> and prospered.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then I heard a holy one speaking; and <i>another</i> holy one said to that certain <i>one</i> who was speaking, &#8220;How long <i>will</i> the vision <i>be, concerning</i> the daily <i>sacrifices</i> and the transgression <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>of desolation, the giving of both the sanctuary and the host to be trampled underfoot?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And he said to me, &#8220;For two thousand three hundred <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>days; then the sanctuary shall be cleansed.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Gabriel Interprets the Vision</span></h3><p><span class="text Dan-8-15"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then it happened, when I, Daniel, had seen the vision and was seeking the meaning, that suddenly there stood before me one having the appearance of a man. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And I heard a man&#8217;s voice between <i>the banks of</i> the Ulai, who called, and said, &#8220;Gabriel, make this <i>man</i> understand the vision.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So he came near where I stood, and when he came I was afraid and fell on my face; but he said to me, &#8220;Understand, son of man, that the vision <i>refers</i> to the time of the end.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Now, as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep with my face to the ground; but he touched me, and stood me upright. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;Look, I am making known to you what shall happen in the latter time of the indignation; for at the appointed time the end <i>shall be.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>The ram which you saw, having the two horns&#8212;<i>they are</i> the kings of Media and Persia. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>male goat <i>is</i> the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>kingdom of Greece.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/8-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>As for the broken <i>horn</i> and the four that stood up in its place, four kingdoms shall arise out of that nation, but not with its power.</span></p> <div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line">
