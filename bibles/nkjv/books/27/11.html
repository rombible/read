<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And now I will tell you the truth: Behold, three more kings will arise in Persia, and the fourth shall be far richer than <i>them</i> all; by his strength, through his riches, he shall stir up all against the realm of Greece. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then a mighty king shall arise, who shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And when he has arisen, his kingdom shall be broken up and divided toward the four winds of heaven, but not among his posterity nor according to his dominion with which he ruled; for his kingdom shall be uprooted, even for others besides these.</span></p> <h3>
Warring Kings of North and South</span></h3><p><span class="text Dan-11-5"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8220;Also the king of the South shall become strong, as well as <i>one</i> of his princes; and he shall gain power over him and have dominion. His dominion <i>shall be</i> a great dominion. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And at the end of <i>some</i> years they shall join forces, for the daughter of the king of the South shall go to the king of the North to make an agreement; but she shall not retain the power of her <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>authority, and neither he nor his <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>authority shall stand; but she shall be given up, with those who brought her, and with him who begot her, and with him who strengthened her in <i>those</i> times. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But from a branch of her roots <i>one</i> shall arise in his place, who shall come with an army, enter the fortress of the king of the North, and deal with them and prevail. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And he shall also carry their gods captive to Egypt, with their <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>princes <i>and</i> their precious articles of silver and gold; and he shall continue <i>more</i> years than the king of the North.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;Also <i>the king of the North</i> shall come to the kingdom of the king of the South, but shall return to his own land. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>However his sons shall stir up strife, and assemble a multitude of great forces; and <i>one</i> shall certainly come and overwhelm and pass through; then he shall return to his fortress and stir up strife.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8220;And the king of the South shall be moved with rage, and go out and fight with him, with the king of the North, who shall muster a great multitude; but the multitude shall be given into the hand of his <i>enemy.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>When he has taken away the multitude, his heart will be <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>lifted up; and he will cast down tens of thousands, but he will not prevail. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For the king of the North will return and muster a multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come at the end of some years with a great army and much equipment.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>&#8220;Now in those times many shall rise up against the king of the South.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So the king of the North shall come and build a siege mound, and take a fortified city; and the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>forces of the South shall not withstand <i>him.</i> Even his choice troops <i>shall have</i> no strength to resist. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But he who comes against him shall do according to his own will, and no one shall stand against him.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>&#8220;He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom, and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>upright ones with him; thus shall he do.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>After this he shall turn his face to the coastlands, and shall take many. But a ruler shall bring the reproach against them to an end; and with the reproach removed, he shall turn back on him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then he shall turn his face toward the fortress of his own land; but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>&#8220;There shall arise in his place one who imposes taxes <i>on</i> the glorious kingdom; but within a few days he shall be destroyed, but not in anger or in battle. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And in his place shall arise a vile person, to whom they will not give the honor of royalty; but he shall come in peaceably, and seize the kingdom by intrigue. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>With the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>force of a flood they shall be swept away from before him and be broken, and also the prince of the covenant. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And after the league <i>is made</i> with him he shall act deceitfully, for he shall come up and become strong with a small <i>number of</i> people. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>He shall enter peaceably, even into the richest places of the province; and he shall do <i>what</i> his fathers have not done, nor his forefathers: he shall disperse among them the plunder, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span>spoil, and riches; and he shall devise his plans against the strongholds, but <i>only</i> for a time.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>&#8220;He shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the South with a great army. And the king of the South shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand, for they shall devise plans against him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Yes, those who eat of the portion of his delicacies shall destroy him; his army shall <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[l]</a></span>be swept away, and many shall fall down slain. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Both these kings&#8217; hearts <i>shall be</i> bent on evil, and they shall speak lies at the same table; but it shall not prosper, for the end <i>will</i> still <i>be</i> at the appointed time. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>While returning to his land with great riches, his heart shall be <i>moved</i> against the holy covenant; so he shall do <i>damage</i> and return to his own land.</span></p> <h3>
The Northern King&#8217;s Blasphemies</span></h3><p><span class="text Dan-11-29"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>&#8220;At the appointed time he shall return and go toward the south; but it shall not be like the former or the latter. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>For ships from <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[m]</a></span>Cyprus shall come against him; therefore he shall be grieved, and return in rage against the holy covenant, and do <i>damage.</i></span></p><p><span class="text Dan-11-30">&#8220;So he shall return and show regard for those who forsake the holy covenant. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>And <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[n]</a></span>forces shall be mustered by him, and they shall defile the sanctuary fortress; then they shall take away the daily <i>sacrifices,</i> and place <i>there</i> the abomination of desolation. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Those who do wickedly against the covenant he shall <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[o]</a></span>corrupt with flattery; but the people who know their God shall be strong, and carry out <i>great exploits.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And those of the people who understand shall instruct many; yet <i>for many</i> days they shall fall by sword and flame, by captivity and plundering. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Now when they fall, they shall be aided with a little help; but many shall join with them by <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[p]</a></span>intrigue. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>And <i>some</i> of those of understanding shall fall, to refine them, purify <i>them,</i> and make <i>them</i> white, <i>until</i> the time of the end; because <i>it is</i> still for the appointed time.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>&#8220;Then the king shall do according to his own will: he shall exalt and magnify himself above every god, shall speak blasphemies against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the wrath has been accomplished; for what has been determined shall be done. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>He shall regard neither the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[q]</a></span>God of his fathers nor the desire of women, nor regard any god; for he shall exalt himself above <i>them</i> all. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>But in their place he shall honor a god of fortresses; and a god which his fathers did not know he shall honor with gold and silver, with precious stones and pleasant things. </span>
