<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>in the first year of his reign I, Daniel, understood by the books the number of the years <i>specified</i> by the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> through Jeremiah the prophet, that He would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then I set my face toward the Lord God to make request by prayer and supplications, with fasting, sackcloth, and ashes. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And I prayed to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> my God, and made confession, and said, &#8220;O Lord, great and awesome God, who keeps His covenant and mercy with those who love Him, and with those who keep His commandments, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>we have sinned and committed iniquity, we have done wickedly and rebelled, even by departing from Your precepts and Your judgments. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Neither have we heeded Your servants the prophets, who spoke in Your name to our kings and our princes, to our fathers and all the people of the land. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>O Lord, righteousness <i>belongs</i> to You, but to us shame of face, as <i>it is</i> this day&#8212;to the men of Judah, to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and all Israel, those near and those far off in all the countries to which You have driven them, because of the unfaithfulness which they have committed against You.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8220;O Lord, to us <i>belongs</i> shame of face, to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, because we have sinned against You. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>To the Lord our God <i>belong</i> mercy and forgiveness, though we have rebelled against Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>We have not obeyed the voice of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God, to walk in His laws, which He set before us by His servants the prophets. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Yes, all Israel has transgressed Your law, and has departed so as not to obey Your voice; therefore the curse and the oath written in the Law of Moses the servant of God have been poured out on us, because we have sinned against Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And He has confirmed His words, which He spoke against us and against our judges who judged us, by bringing upon us a great disaster; for under the whole heaven such has never been done as what has been done to Jerusalem.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8220;As <i>it is</i> written in the Law of Moses, all this disaster has come upon us; yet we have not made our prayer before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God, that we might turn from our iniquities and understand Your truth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Therefore the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has kept the disaster in mind, and brought it upon us; for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God <i>is</i> righteous in all the works which He does, though we have not obeyed His voice. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And now, O Lord our God, who brought Your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and made Yourself a name, as <i>it is</i> this day&#8212;we have sinned, we have done wickedly!</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>&#8220;O Lord, according to all Your righteousness, I pray, let Your anger and Your fury be turned away from Your city Jerusalem, Your holy mountain; because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and Your people <i>are</i> a reproach to all <i>those</i> around us. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Now therefore, our God, hear the prayer of Your servant, and his supplications, and for the Lord&#8217;s sake <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>cause Your face to shine on <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>Your sanctuary, which is desolate. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>O my God, incline Your ear and hear; open Your eyes and see our desolations, and the city which is called by Your name; for we do not present our supplications before You because of our righteous deeds, but because of Your great mercies. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>O Lord, hear! O Lord, forgive! O Lord, listen and act! Do not delay for Your own sake, my God, for Your city and Your people are called by Your name.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
