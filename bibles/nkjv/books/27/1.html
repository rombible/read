<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with some of the articles of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>the house of God, which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the articles into the treasure house of his god.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then the king instructed Ashpenaz, the master of his eunuchs, to bring some of the children of Israel and some of the king&#8217;s descendants and some of the nobles, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>young men in whom <i>there was</i> no blemish, but good-looking, gifted in all wisdom, possessing knowledge and quick to understand, who <i>had</i> ability to serve in the king&#8217;s palace, and whom they might teach the language and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>literature of the Chaldeans. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And the king appointed for them a daily provision of the king&#8217;s delicacies and of the wine which he drank, and three years of training for them, so that at the end of <i>that time</i> they might serve before the king. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now from among those of the sons of Judah were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>To them the chief of the eunuchs gave names: he gave Daniel <i>the name</i> Belteshazzar; to Hananiah, Shadrach; to Mishael, Meshach; and to Azariah, Abed-Nego.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king&#8217;s delicacies, nor with the wine which he drank; therefore he requested of the chief of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Now God had brought Daniel into the favor and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>goodwill of the chief of the eunuchs. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And the chief of the eunuchs said to Daniel, &#8220;I fear my lord the king, who has appointed your food and drink. For why should he see your faces looking worse than the young men who <i>are</i> your age? Then you would endanger my head before the king.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So Daniel said to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>the steward whom the chief of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>&#8220;Please test your servants for ten days, and let them give us vegetables to eat and water to drink. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then let our appearance be examined before you, and the appearance of the young men who eat the portion of the king&#8217;s delicacies; and as you see fit, <i>so</i> deal with your servants.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So he consented with them in this matter, and tested them ten days.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And at the end of ten days their features appeared better and fatter in flesh than all the young men who ate the portion of the king&#8217;s delicacies. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Thus <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>the steward took away their portion of delicacies and the wine that they were to drink, and gave them vegetables.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>As for these four young men, God gave them knowledge and skill in all literature and wisdom; and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/1-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Now at the end of the days, when the king had said that they should be brought in, the chief of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/1-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then the king <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>interviewed them, and among them all none was found like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; therefore they served before the king. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/1-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And in all matters of wisdom <i>and</i> understanding about which the king examined them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians <i>and</i> astrologers who <i>were</i> in all his realm. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/1-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Thus Daniel continued until the first year of King Cyrus.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-21740a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Daniel 1:2">Daniel 1:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'>The temple</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-21742b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Daniel 1:4">Daniel 1:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>writing</i> or <i>book</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-21747c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Daniel 1:9">Daniel 1:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>kindness</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-21749d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Daniel 1:11">Daniel 1:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>Melzar</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-21754e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Daniel 1:16">Daniel 1:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>Melzar</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-21757f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Daniel 1:19">Daniel 1:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>talked with them</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
