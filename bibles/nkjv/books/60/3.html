<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>when they observe your chaste conduct <i>accompanied</i> by fear. </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For in this manner, in former times, the holy women who trusted in God also adorned themselves, being submissive to their own husbands, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, whose daughters you are if you do good and are not afraid with any terror.</span></p> <h3>
A Word to Husbands</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Pet-3-7"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Husbands, likewise, dwell with <i>them</i> with understanding, giving honor to the wife, as to the weaker vessel, and as <i>being</i> heirs together of the grace of life, that your prayers may not be hindered.</span></p> <h3>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>not returning evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary blessing, knowing that you were called to this, that you may inherit a blessing. </span>
