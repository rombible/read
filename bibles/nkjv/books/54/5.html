<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>older women as mothers, younger women as sisters, with all purity.</span></p> <h3>
Honor True Widows</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Tim-5-3"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Honor widows who are really widows. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn to show piety at home and to repay their parents; for this is <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>good and acceptable before God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now she who is really a widow, and left alone, trusts in God and continues in supplications and prayers night and day. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But she who lives in <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>pleasure is dead while she lives. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And these things command, that they may be blameless. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Do not let a widow under sixty years old be taken into the number, <i>and not unless</i> she has been the wife of one man, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>well reported for good works: if she has brought up children, if she has lodged strangers, if she has washed the saints&#8217; feet, if she has relieved the afflicted, if she has diligently followed every good work.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>refuse <i>the</i> younger widows; for when they have begun to grow wanton against Christ, they desire to marry, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>having condemnation because they have cast off their first <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>faith. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And besides they learn <i>to be</i> idle, wandering about from house to house, and not only idle but also gossips and busybodies, saying things which they ought not. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Therefore I desire that <i>the</i> younger <i>widows</i> marry, bear children, manage the house, give no opportunity to the adversary to speak reproachfully. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>For some have already turned aside after Satan. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>If any believing <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>man or woman has widows, let them <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>relieve them, and do not let the church be burdened, that it may relieve those who are really widows.</span></p> <h3>
Honor the Elders</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Tim-5-17"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word and doctrine. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>For the Scripture says, <span class="oblique">&#8220;You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain,&#8221;</span> and, <span class="woj">&#8220;The laborer <i>is</i> worthy of his wages.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Do not receive an accusation against an elder except from two or three witnesses. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Those who are sinning rebuke in the presence of all, that the rest also may fear.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>I charge <i>you</i> before God and the Lord Jesus Christ and the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>elect angels that you observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing with partiality. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Do not lay hands on anyone hastily, nor share in other people&#8217;s sins; keep yourself pure.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>No longer drink only water, but use a little wine for your stomach&#8217;s sake and your frequent <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>infirmities.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Some men&#8217;s sins are clearly evident, preceding <i>them</i> to judgment, but those of some <i>men</i> follow later. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Likewise, the good works <i>of some</i> are clearly evident, and those that are otherwise cannot be hidden.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-29768a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Timothy 5:4">1 Timothy 5:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M omit <i>good and</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29770b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Timothy 5:6">1 Timothy 5:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>indulgence</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29775c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Timothy 5:11">1 Timothy 5:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Refuse to enroll</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29776d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Timothy 5:12">1 Timothy 5:12</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>solemn promise</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29780e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Timothy 5:16">1 Timothy 5:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>man or</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29780f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Timothy 5:16">1 Timothy 5:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>give aid to</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29785g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Timothy 5:21">1 Timothy 5:21</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>chosen</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29787h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Timothy 5:23">1 Timothy 5:23</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>illnesses</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
