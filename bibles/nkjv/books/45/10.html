<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For they being ignorant of God&#8217;s righteousness, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted to the righteousness of God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For Christ <i>is</i> the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For Moses writes about the righteousness which is of the law, <span class="oblique">&#8220;The man who does those things shall live by them.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But the righteousness of faith speaks in this way, <span class="oblique">&#8220;Do not say in your heart, &#8216;Who will ascend into heaven?&#8217; &#8221;</span> (that is, to bring Christ down <i>from above</i>) </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>or, <span class="oblique">&#8220; &#8216;Who will descend into the abyss?&#8217; &#8221;</span> (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead). </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But what does it say? <span class="oblique">&#8220;The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart&#8221;</span> (that is, the word of faith which we preach): </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For the Scripture says, <span class="oblique">&#8220;Whoever believes on Him will not be put to shame.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For <span class="oblique">&#8220;whoever calls</span> <span class="oblique">on the name of the</span> <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <span class="oblique">shall be saved.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Israel Rejects the Gospel</span></h3><p><span class="text Rom-10-14"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And how shall they preach unless they are sent? As it is written:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Rom-10-15"><span class="oblique">&#8220;How beautiful are the feet of those who</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span><span class="oblique">preach the gospel of peace,</span></span><br /><span class="text Rom-10-15"><span class="oblique">Who bring glad tidings of good things!&#8221;</span></span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, <span class="oblique">&#8220;</span><span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span><span class="oblique">, who has believed our report?&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So then faith <i>comes</i> by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>But I say, have they not heard? Yes indeed:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Rom-10-18"><span class="oblique">&#8220;Their sound has gone out to all the earth,</span></span><br /><span class="text Rom-10-18"><span class="oblique">And their words to the ends of the world.&#8221;</span></span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>But I say, did Israel not know? First Moses says:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Rom-10-19"><span class="oblique">&#8220;I will provoke you to jealousy by</span> <i>those who are</i> <span class="oblique">not a nation,</span></span><br /><span class="text Rom-10-19"><span class="oblique">I will move you to anger by a</span> <span class="oblique">foolish nation.&#8221;</span></span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>But Isaiah is very bold and says:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Rom-10-20"><span class="oblique">&#8220;I was found by those who did not seek Me;</span></span><br /><span class="text Rom-10-20"><span class="oblique">I was made manifest to those who did not ask for Me.&#8221;</span></span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>But to Israel he says:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Rom-10-21"><span class="oblique">&#8220;All day long I have stretched out My hands</span></span><br /><span class="text Rom-10-21"><span class="oblique">To a disobedient and contrary people.&#8221;</span></span></p></div> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-28190a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Romans 10:1">Romans 10:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>them</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28204b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Romans 10:15">Romans 10:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>preach the gospel of peace, Who</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
