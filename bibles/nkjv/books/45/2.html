<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>But we know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who practice such things. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And do you think this, O man, you who judge those practicing such things, and doing the same, that you will escape the judgment of God? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Or do you despise the riches of His goodness, forbearance, and longsuffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But in accordance with your hardness and your <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>impenitent heart you are <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>who <span class="oblique">&#8220;will render to each one according to his deeds&#8221;</span>: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>eternal life to those who by patient continuance in doing good seek for glory, honor, and immortality; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>but to those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness&#8212;indignation and wrath, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>tribulation and anguish, on every soul of man who does evil, of the Jew first and also of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Greek; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>but glory, honor, and peace to everyone who works what is good, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For there is no partiality with God.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>For as many as have sinned without law will also perish without law, and as many as have sinned in the law will be judged by the law </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>(for not the hearers of the law <i>are</i> just in the sight of God, but the doers of the law will be justified; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>for when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do the things in the law, these, although not having the law, are a law to themselves, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>who show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and between themselves <i>their</i> thoughts accusing or else excusing <i>them</i>) </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>in the day when God will judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to my gospel.</span></p> <h3>
The Jews Guilty as the Gentiles</span></h3><p><span class="text Rom-2-17"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>Indeed you are called a Jew, and rest<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span> on the law, and make your boast in God, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>and know <i>His</i> will, and approve the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the law, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>and are confident that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, having the form of knowledge and truth in the law. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>You, therefore, who teach another, do you not teach yourself? You who preach that a man should not steal, do you steal? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>You who say, &#8220;Do not commit adultery,&#8221; do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>You who make your boast in the law, do you dishonor God through breaking the law? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>For <span class="oblique">&#8220;the name of God is</span> <span class="oblique">blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you,&#8221;</span> as it is written.</span></p> <h3>
Circumcision of No Avail</span></h3><p><span class="text Rom-2-25"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>For circumcision is indeed profitable if you keep the law; but if you are a breaker of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Therefore, if an uncircumcised man keeps the righteous requirements of the law, will not his uncircumcision be counted as circumcision? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And will not the physically uncircumcised, if he fulfills the law, judge you who, <i>even</i> with <i>your</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>written <i>code</i> and circumcision, <i>are</i> a transgressor of the law? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>For he is not a Jew who <i>is one</i> outwardly, nor <i>is</i> circumcision that which <i>is</i> outward in the flesh; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>but <i>he is</i> a Jew who <i>is one</i> inwardly; and circumcision <i>is that</i> of the heart, in the Spirit, not in the letter; whose <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>praise <i>is</i> not from men but from God.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-27968a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Romans 2:5">Romans 2:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>unrepentant</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27968b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Romans 2:5">Romans 2:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>storing</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27972c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Romans 2:9">Romans 2:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Gentile</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27980d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Romans 2:17">Romans 2:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>But if</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27980e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Romans 2:17">Romans 2:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>rely</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27990f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Romans 2:27">Romans 2:27</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>letter</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27992g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Romans 2:29">Romans 2:29</span> <span class='footnote-text'>A play on words&#8212;<i>Jew</i> is literally <i>praise.</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
