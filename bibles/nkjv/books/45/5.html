<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>through whom also we have access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And not only <i>that,</i> but we also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>perseverance; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and perseverance, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>character; and character, hope. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us.</span></p> <h3>
Christ in Our Place</span></h3><p><span class="text Rom-5-6"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>For when we were still without strength, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>in due time Christ died for the ungodly. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For scarcely for a righteous man will one die; yet perhaps for a good man someone would even dare to die. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And not only <i>that,</i> but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.</span></p> <h3>
Death in Adam, Life in Christ</span></h3><p><span class="text Rom-5-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Therefore, just as through one man sin entered the world, and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men, because all sinned&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>(For until the law sin was in the world, but sin is not imputed when there is no law. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who had not sinned according to the likeness of the transgression of Adam, who is a type of Him who was to come. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But the free gift <i>is</i> not like the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>offense. For if by the one man&#8217;s offense many died, much more the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one Man, Jesus Christ, abounded to many. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And the gift <i>is</i> not like <i>that which came</i> through the one who sinned. For the judgment <i>which came</i> from one <i>offense resulted</i> in condemnation, but the free gift <i>which came</i> from many <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>offenses <i>resulted</i> in justification. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>For if by the one man&#8217;s <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>offense death reigned through the one, much more those who receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.)</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Therefore, as through <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>one man&#8217;s offense <i>judgment came</i> to all men, resulting in condemnation, even so through one<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span> Man&#8217;s righteous act <i>the free gift came</i> to all men, resulting in justification of life. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>For as by one man&#8217;s disobedience many were made sinners, so also by one Man&#8217;s obedience many will be made righteous.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Moreover the law entered that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace abounded much more, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>so that as sin reigned in death, even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-28049a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Romans 5:1">Romans 5:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Some ancient mss. <i>let us have</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28051b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Romans 5:3">Romans 5:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>endurance</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28052c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Romans 5:4">Romans 5:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>approved character</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28054d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Romans 5:6">Romans 5:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>at the right time</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28063e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Romans 5:15">Romans 5:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>trespass</i> or <i>false step</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28064f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Romans 5:16">Romans 5:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>trespasses</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28065g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Romans 5:17">Romans 5:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>trespass</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28066h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Romans 5:18">Romans 5:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>one trespass</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28066i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Romans 5:18">Romans 5:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>one righteous act</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
