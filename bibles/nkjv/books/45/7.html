<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/7-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>For the woman who has a husband is bound by the law to <i>her</i> husband as long as he lives. But if the husband dies, she is released from the law of <i>her</i> husband. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/7-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So then if, while <i>her</i> husband lives, she marries another man, she will be called an adulteress; but if her husband dies, she is free from that law, so that she is no adulteress, though she has married another man. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Therefore, my brethren, you also have become dead to the law through the body of Christ, that you may be married to another&#8212;to Him who was raised from the dead, that we should bear fruit to God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/7-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions which were aroused by the law were at work in our members to bear fruit to death. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/7-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But now we have been delivered from the law, having died to what we were held by, so that we should serve in the newness of the Spirit and not <i>in</i> the oldness of the letter.</span></p> <h3>
Sin&#8217;s Advantage in the Law</span></h3><p><span class="text Rom-7-7"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/7-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>What shall we say then? <i>Is</i> the law sin? Certainly not! On the contrary, I would not have known sin except through the law. For I would not have known covetousness unless the law had said, <span class="oblique">&#8220;You shall not covet.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/7-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But sin, taking opportunity by the commandment, produced in me all <i>manner of evil</i> desire. For apart from the law sin <i>was</i> dead. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>I was alive once without the law, but when the commandment came, sin revived and I died. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And the commandment, which <i>was</i> to <i>bring</i> life, I found to <i>bring</i> death. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/7-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it killed <i>me.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/7-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Therefore the law <i>is</i> holy, and the commandment holy and just and good.</span></p> <h3>
Law Cannot Save from Sin</span></h3><p><span class="text Rom-7-13"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/7-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Has then what is good become death to me? Certainly not! But sin, that it might appear sin, was producing death in me through what is good, so that sin through the commandment might become exceedingly sinful. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/7-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold under sin. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/7-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>For what I am doing, I do not understand. For what I will to do, that I do not practice; but what I hate, that I do. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/7-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>If, then, I do what I will not to do, I agree with the law that <i>it is</i> good. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/7-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But now, <i>it is</i> no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells in me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/7-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) nothing good dwells; for to will is present with me, but <i>how</i> to perform what is good I do not find. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/7-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>For the good that I will <i>to do,</i> I do not do; but the evil I will not <i>to do,</i> that I practice. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/7-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Now if I do what I will not <i>to do,</i> it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells in me.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/7-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>I find then a law, that evil is present with me, the one who wills to do good. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/7-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>For I delight in the law of God according to the inward man. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/7-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/7-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>O wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/7-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>I thank God&#8212;through Jesus Christ our Lord!</span></p><p><span class="text Rom-7-25">So then, with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-28093a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Romans 7:1">Romans 7:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>rules</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
