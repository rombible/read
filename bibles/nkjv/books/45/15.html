<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Let each of us please <i>his</i> neighbor for <i>his</i> good, leading to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>edification. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For even Christ did not please Himself; but as it is written, <span class="oblique">&#8220;The reproaches of those who reproached You fell on Me.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For whatever things were written before were written for our learning, that we through the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now may the God of patience and comfort grant you to be like-minded toward one another, according to Christ Jesus, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>that you may with one mind <i>and</i> one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p> <h3>
Glorify God Together</span></h3><p><span class="text Rom-15-7"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Therefore receive one another, just as Christ also received <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>us, to the glory of God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Now I say that Jesus Christ has become a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>servant to the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises <i>made</i> to the fathers, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and that the Gentiles might glorify God for <i>His</i> mercy, as it is written:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Rom-15-9"><span class="oblique">&#8220;For this reason I will confess to You among the Gentiles,</span></span><br /><span class="text Rom-15-9"><span class="oblique">And sing to Your name.&#8221;</span></span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And again he says:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Rom-15-10"><span class="oblique">&#8220;Rejoice, O Gentiles, with His people!&#8221;</span></span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And again:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Rom-15-11"><span class="oblique">&#8220;Praise the</span> <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span><span class="oblique">, all you Gentiles!</span></span><br /><span class="text Rom-15-11"><span class="oblique">Laud Him, all you peoples!&#8221;</span></span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And again, Isaiah says:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Rom-15-12"><span class="oblique">&#8220;There shall be a root of Jesse;</span></span><br /><span class="text Rom-15-12"><span class="oblique">And He who shall rise to reign over the Gentiles,</span></span><br /><span class="text Rom-15-12"><span class="oblique">In Him the Gentiles shall hope.&#8221;</span></span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.</span></p> <h3>
From Jerusalem to Illyricum</span></h3><p><span class="text Rom-15-14"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Now I myself am confident concerning you, my brethren, that you also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>one another. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Nevertheless, brethren, I have written more boldly to you on <i>some</i> points, as reminding you, because of the grace given to me by God, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>that I might be a minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>of the Gentiles might be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Therefore I have reason to glory in Christ Jesus in the things <i>which pertain</i> to God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ has not accomplished through me, in word and deed, to make the Gentiles obedient&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>in mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God, so that from Jerusalem and round about to Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And so I have made it my aim to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build on another man&#8217;s foundation, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>but as it is written:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Rom-15-21"><span class="oblique">&#8220;To whom He was not announced, they shall see;</span></span><br /><span class="text Rom-15-21"><span class="oblique">And those who have not heard shall understand.&#8221;</span></span></p></div> <h3>
Plan to Visit Rome</span></h3><p><span class="text Rom-15-22"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>For this reason I also have been much hindered from coming to you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>But now no longer having a place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come to you, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>whenever I journey to Spain, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>I shall come to you. For I hope to see you on my journey, and to be helped on my way there by you, if first I may enjoy your <i>company</i> for a while. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>But now I am going to Jerusalem to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>minister to the saints. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>For it pleased those from Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints who are in Jerusalem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>It pleased them indeed, and they are their debtors. For if the Gentiles have been partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister to them in material things. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Therefore, when I have performed this and have sealed to them this fruit, I shall go by way of you to Spain. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>But I know that when I come to you, I shall come in the fullness of the blessing <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>of the gospel of Christ.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Now I beg you, brethren, through the Lord Jesus Christ, and through the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in prayers to God for me, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>that I may be delivered from those in Judea who <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span>do not believe, and that my service for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>that I may come to you with joy by the will of God, and may be refreshed together with you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Now the God of peace <i>be</i> with you all.
