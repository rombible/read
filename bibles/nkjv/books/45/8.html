<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God <i>did</i> by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, on account of sin: He condemned sin in the flesh, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those <i>who live</i> according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>For to be <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>carnally minded <i>is</i> death, but to be spiritually minded <i>is</i> life and peace. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Because the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>carnal mind <i>is</i> enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, nor indeed can be. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So then, those who are in the flesh cannot please God.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. Now if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not His. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And if Christ <i>is</i> in you, the body <i>is</i> dead because of sin, but the Spirit <i>is</i> life because of righteousness. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>through His Spirit who dwells in you.</span></p> <h3>
Sonship Through the Spirit</span></h3><p><span class="text Rom-8-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Therefore, brethren, we are debtors&#8212;not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For if you live according to the flesh you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, &#8220;Abba,<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span> Father.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>and if children, then heirs&#8212;heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with <i>Him,</i> that we may also be glorified together.</span></p> <h3>
From Suffering to Glory</span></h3><p><span class="text Rom-8-18"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy <i>to be compared</i> with the glory which shall be revealed in us. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>For the earnest expectation of the creation eagerly waits for the revealing of the sons of God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of Him who subjected <i>it</i> in hope; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>because the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>For we know that the whole creation groans and labors with birth pangs together until now. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Not only <i>that,</i> but we also who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, eagerly waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our body. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>For we were saved in this hope, but hope that is seen is not hope; for why does one still hope for what he sees? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>But if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly wait for <i>it</i> with perseverance.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself makes intercession <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Now He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit <i>is,</i> because He makes intercession for the saints according to <i>the will of</i> God.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to <i>His</i> purpose. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>For whom He foreknew, He also predestined <i>to be</i> conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the firstborn among many brethren. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Moreover whom He predestined, these He also called; whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified.</span></p> <h3>
God&#8217;s Everlasting Love</span></h3><p><span class="text Rom-8-31"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>What then shall we say to these things? If God <i>is</i> for us, who <i>can be</i> against us? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Who shall bring a charge against God&#8217;s elect? <i>It is</i> God who justifies. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Who <i>is</i> he who condemns? <i>It is</i> Christ who died, and furthermore is also risen, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? <i>Shall</i> tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>As it is written:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Rom-8-36"><span class="oblique">&#8220;For Your sake we are killed all day long;</span></span><br /><span class="text Rom-8-36"><span class="oblique">We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.&#8221;</span></span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor powers, nor things present nor things to come, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-28118a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Romans 8:1">Romans 8:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits the rest of v. <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Rom.8.1" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=Rom.8.1&amp;version=NKJV">1</span>.</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28123b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Romans 8:6">Romans 8:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>fleshly</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28124c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Romans 8:7">Romans 8:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>fleshly</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28128d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Romans 8:11">Romans 8:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>because of</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28132e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Romans 8:15">Romans 8:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit., in Aram., <i>Father</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28138f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Romans 8:21">Romans 8:21</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>decay</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28143g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Romans 8:26">Romans 8:26</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>for us</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
