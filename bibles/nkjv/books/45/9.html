<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>that I have great sorrow and continual grief in my heart. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>countrymen according to the flesh, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>who are Israelites, to whom <i>pertain</i> the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service <i>of God,</i> and the promises; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>of whom <i>are</i> the fathers and from whom, according to the flesh, Christ <i>came,</i> who is over all, <i>the</i> eternally blessed God. Amen.</span></p> <h3>
Israel&#8217;s Rejection and God&#8217;s Purpose</span></h3><p><span class="text Rom-9-6"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But it is not that the word of God has taken no effect. For they <i>are</i> not all Israel who <i>are</i> of Israel, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>nor <i>are they</i> all children because they are the seed of Abraham; but, <span class="oblique">&#8220;In Isaac your seed shall be called.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>That is, those who <i>are</i> the children of the flesh, these <i>are</i> not the children of God; but the children of the promise are counted as the seed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For this <i>is</i> the word of promise: <span class="oblique">&#8220;At this time I will come and Sarah shall have a son.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And not only <i>this,</i> but when Rebecca also had conceived by one man, <i>even</i> by our father Isaac </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>(for <i>the children</i> not yet being born, nor having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works but of Him who calls), </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>it was said to her, <span class="oblique">&#8220;The older shall serve the younger.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>As it is written, <span class="oblique">&#8220;Jacob I have loved, but Esau I have hated.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Israel&#8217;s Rejection and God&#8217;s Justice</span></h3><p><span class="text Rom-9-14"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>What shall we say then? <i>Is there</i> unrighteousness with God? Certainly not! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>For He says to Moses, <span class="oblique">&#8220;I will have mercy on whomever I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whomever I will have compassion.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So then <i>it is</i> not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>For the Scripture says to the Pharaoh, <span class="oblique">&#8220;For this very purpose I have raised you up, that I may show My power in you, and that My name may be declared in all the earth.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Therefore He has mercy on whom He wills, and whom He wills He hardens.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>You will say to me then, &#8220;Why does He still find fault? For who has resisted His will?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>But indeed, O man, who are you to reply against God? Will the thing formed say to him who formed <i>it</i>, &#8220;Why have you made me like this?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Does not the potter have power over the clay, from the same lump to make one vessel for honor and another for dishonor?</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span><i>What</i> if God, wanting to show <i>His</i> wrath and to make His power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath prepared for destruction, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>and that He might make known the riches of His glory on the vessels of mercy, which He had prepared beforehand for glory, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>even us whom He called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>As He says also in Hosea:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Rom-9-25"><span class="oblique">&#8220;I will call them My people, who were not My people,</span></span><br /><span class="text Rom-9-25"><span class="oblique">And her beloved, who was not beloved.&#8221;</span></span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span><span class="oblique">&#8220;And</span> <span class="oblique">it shall come to pass in the place where it was said to them,</span></span><br /><span class="text Rom-9-26"><span class="oblique">&#8216;You</span> <i>are</i> <span class="oblique">not My people,&#8217;</span></span><br /><span class="text Rom-9-26"><span class="oblique">There they shall be called sons of the living God.&#8221;</span></span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Isaiah also cries out concerning Israel:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Rom-9-27"><span class="oblique">&#8220;Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea,</span></span><br /><span class="text Rom-9-27"><span class="oblique">The remnant will be saved.</span></span><br />

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And as Isaiah said before:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Rom-9-29"><span class="oblique">&#8220;Unless the</span> <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <span class="oblique">of</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span><span class="oblique">Sabaoth had left us a seed,</span></span><br /><span class="text Rom-9-29"><span class="oblique">We would have become like Sodom,</span></span><br /><span class="text Rom-9-29"><span class="oblique">And we would have been made like Gomorrah.&#8221;</span></span></p></div> <h3>
Present Condition of Israel</span></h3><p><span class="text Rom-9-30"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>What shall we say then? That Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness of faith; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>but Israel, pursuing the law of righteousness, has not attained to the law <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>of righteousness. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Why? Because <i>they did</i> not <i>seek it</i> by faith, but as it were, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumbling stone. </span>
