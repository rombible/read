For there is no authority except from God, and the authorities that exist are appointed by God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Therefore whoever resists the authority resists the ordinance of God, and those who resist will <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>bring judgment on themselves. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil. Do you want to be unafraid of the authority? Do what is good, and you will have praise from the same. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For he is God&#8217;s minister to you for good. But if you do evil, be afraid; for he does not bear the sword in vain; for he is God&#8217;s minister, an avenger to <i>execute</i> wrath on him who practices evil. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Therefore <i>you</i> must be subject, not only because of wrath but also for conscience&#8217; sake. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/13-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>For because of this you also pay taxes, for they are God&#8217;s ministers attending continually to this very thing. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/13-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Render therefore to all their due: taxes to whom taxes <i>are due,</i> customs to whom customs, fear to whom fear, honor to whom honor.</span></p> <h3>
Love Your Neighbor</span></h3><p><span class="text Rom-13-8"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Owe no one anything except to love one another, for he who loves another has fulfilled the law. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/13-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For the commandments, <span class="oblique">&#8220;You shall not commit adultery,&#8221; &#8220;You shall not murder,&#8221; &#8220;You shall not steal,&#8221;</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span><span class="oblique">&#8220;You shall not bear false witness,&#8221; &#8220;You shall not covet,&#8221;</span> and if <i>there is</i> any other commandment, are <i>all</i> summed up in this saying, namely, <span class="oblique">&#8220;You shall love your neighbor as yourself.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/13-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Love does no harm to a neighbor; therefore love <i>is</i> the fulfillment of the law.</span></p> <h3>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/13-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>The night is far spent, the day is at hand. Therefore let us cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light. </span>
