<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>which He promised before through His prophets in the Holy Scriptures, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>concerning His Son Jesus Christ our Lord, who <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>was born of the seed of David according to the flesh, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span><i>and</i> declared <i>to be</i> the Son of God with power according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Through Him we have received grace and apostleship for obedience to the faith among all nations for His name, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>among whom you also are the called of Jesus Christ;</span></p> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>To all who are in Rome, beloved of God, called <i>to be</i> saints:</span></p><p class="top-1"><span class="text Rom-1-7">Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p> <h3>
Desire to Visit Rome</span></h3><p><span class="text Rom-1-8"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For God is my witness, whom I serve <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>with my spirit in the gospel of His Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>making request if, by some means, now at last I may find a way in the will of God to come to you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, so that you may be established&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>that is, that I may be encouraged together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Now I do not want you to be unaware, brethren, that I often planned to come to you (but was hindered until now), that I might have some fruit among you also, just as among the other Gentiles. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>I am a debtor both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to wise and to unwise. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So, as much as is in me, <i>I am</i> ready to preach the gospel to you who are in Rome also.</span></p> <h3>
The Just Live by Faith</span></h3><p><span class="text Rom-1-16"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>For I am not ashamed of the gospel <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>of Christ, for it is the power of God to salvation for everyone who believes, for the Jew first and also for the Greek. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith; as it is written, <span class="oblique">&#8220;The just shall live by faith.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
God&#8217;s Wrath on Unrighteousness</span></h3><p><span class="text Rom-1-18"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>suppress the truth in unrighteousness, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>because what may be known of God is <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>manifest <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>in them, for God has shown <i>it</i> to them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>For since the creation of the world His invisible <i>attributes</i> are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, <i>even</i> His eternal power and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>Godhead, so that they are without excuse, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>because, although they knew God, they did not glorify <i>Him</i> as God, nor were thankful, but became futile in their thoughts, and their foolish hearts were darkened. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Professing to be wise, they became fools, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>corruptible man&#8212;and birds and four-footed animals and creeping things.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Therefore God also gave them up to uncleanness, in the lusts of their hearts, to dishonor their bodies among themselves, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>who exchanged the truth of God for the lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>For this reason God gave them up to vile passions. For even their <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>women exchanged the natural use for what is against nature. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Likewise also the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>men, leaving the natural use of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span>woman, burned in their lust for one another, men with men committing what is shameful, and receiving in themselves the penalty of their error which was due.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And even as they did not like to retain God in <i>their</i> knowledge, God gave them over to a debased mind, to do those things which are not fitting; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>being filled with all unrighteousness, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[l]</a></span>sexual immorality, wickedness, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[m]</a></span>covetousness, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[n]</a></span>maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil-mindedness; <i>they are</i> whisperers, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>backbiters, haters of God, violent, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, </span>
