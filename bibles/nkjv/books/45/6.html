Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Certainly not! How shall we who died to sin live any longer in it? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Or do you not know that as many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/6-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/6-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For if we have been united together in the likeness of His death, certainly we also shall be <i>in the likeness</i> of <i>His</i> resurrection, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>knowing this, that our old man was crucified with <i>Him,</i> that the body of sin might be <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>done away with, that we should no longer be slaves of sin. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For he who has died has been <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>freed from sin. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies no more. Death no longer has dominion over Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/6-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For <i>the death</i> that He died, He died to sin once for all; but <i>the life</i> that He lives, He lives to God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/6-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Likewise you also, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/6-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/6-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And do not present your members <i>as</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>instruments of unrighteousness to sin, but present yourselves to God as being alive from the dead, and your members <i>as</i> instruments of righteousness to God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/6-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under law but under grace.</span></p> <h3>
From Slaves of Sin to Slaves of God</span></h3><p><span class="text Rom-6-15"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/6-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? Certainly not! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/6-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Do you not know that to whom you present yourselves slaves to obey, you are that one&#8217;s slaves whom you obey, whether of sin <i>leading</i> to death, or of obedience <i>leading</i> to righteousness? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/6-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But God be thanked that <i>though</i> you were slaves of sin, yet you obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine to which you were <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>delivered. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/6-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And having been set free from sin, you became slaves of righteousness. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/6-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>I speak in human <i>terms</i> because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you presented your members <i>as</i> slaves of uncleanness, and of lawlessness <i>leading</i> to <i>more</i> lawlessness, so now present your members <i>as</i> slaves <i>of</i> righteousness <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>for holiness.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/6-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>For when you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/6-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>What fruit did you have then in the things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things <i>is</i> death. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/6-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But now having been set free from sin, and having become slaves of God, you have your fruit <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>to holiness, and the end, everlasting life. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/6-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>For the wages of sin <i>is</i> death, but the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>gift of God <i>is</i> eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-28075a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Romans 6:6">Romans 6:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>rendered inoperative</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28076b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Romans 6:7">Romans 6:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>cleared</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28080c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Romans 6:11">Romans 6:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>consider</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28082d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Romans 6:13">Romans 6:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>weapons</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28086e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Romans 6:17">Romans 6:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>entrusted</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28088f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Romans 6:19">Romans 6:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>unto sanctification</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28091g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Romans 6:22">Romans 6:22</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>unto sanctification</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28092h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Romans 6:23">Romans 6:23</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>free gift</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
