Certainly not! For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, <i>of</i> the tribe of Benjamin. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>God has not cast away His people whom He foreknew. Or do you not know what the Scripture says of Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span><span class="oblique">&#8220;</span><span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span><span class="oblique">, they have killed Your prophets and torn down Your altars, and I alone am left, and they seek my life&#8221;</span>? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But what does the divine response say to him? <span class="oblique">&#8220;I have reserved for Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Even so then, at this present time there is a remnant according to the election of grace. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And if by grace, then <i>it is</i> no longer of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace. <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>But if <i>it is</i> of works, it is no longer grace; otherwise work is no longer work.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>What then? Israel has not obtained what it seeks; but the elect have obtained it, and the rest were blinded. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Just as it is written:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Rom-11-8"><span class="oblique">&#8220;God has given them a spirit of stupor,</span></span><br /><span class="text Rom-11-8"><span class="oblique">Eyes that they should not see</span></span><br /><span class="text Rom-11-8"><span class="oblique">And ears that they should not hear,</span></span><br /><span class="text Rom-11-8"><span class="oblique">To this very day.&#8221;</span></span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And David says:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Rom-11-9"><span class="oblique">&#8220;Let their table become a snare and a trap,</span></span><br /><span class="text Rom-11-9"><span class="oblique">A stumbling block and a recompense to them.</span></span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><span class="oblique">Let their eyes be darkened, so that they do not see,</span></span><br /><span class="text Rom-11-10"><span class="oblique">And bow down their back always.&#8221;</span></span></p></div> <h3>
Israel&#8217;s Rejection Not Final</span></h3><p><span class="text Rom-11-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>I say then, have they stumbled that they should fall? Certainly not! But through their <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>fall, to provoke them to jealousy, salvation <i>has come</i> to the Gentiles. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now if their <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>fall <i>is</i> riches for the world, and their failure riches for the Gentiles, how much more their fullness!</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For I speak to you Gentiles; inasmuch as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>if by any means I may provoke to jealousy <i>those who are</i> my flesh and save some of them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>For if their being cast away <i>is</i> the reconciling of the world, what <i>will</i> their acceptance <i>be</i> but life from the dead?</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>For if the firstfruit <i>is</i> holy, the lump <i>is</i> also <i>holy;</i> and if the root <i>is</i> holy, so <i>are</i> the branches. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them, and with them became a partaker of the root and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>fatness of the olive tree, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>do not boast against the branches. But if you do boast, <i>remember that</i> you do not support the root, but the root <i>supports</i> you.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>You will say then, &#8220;Branches were broken off that I might be grafted in.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Well <i>said.</i> Because of unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by faith. Do not be haughty, but fear. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>For if God did not spare the natural branches, He may not spare you either. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Therefore consider the goodness and severity of God: on those who fell, severity; but toward you, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>goodness, if you continue in <i>His</i> goodness. Otherwise you also will be cut off. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And they also, if they do not continue in unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>For if you were cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and were grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these, who <i>are</i> natural <i>branches,</i> be grafted into their own olive tree?</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>For I do not desire, brethren, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>opinion, that blindness in part has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And so all Israel will be <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>saved, as it is written:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Rom-11-26"><span class="oblique">&#8220;The Deliverer will come out of Zion,</span></span><br /><span class="text Rom-11-26"><span class="oblique">And He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob;</span></span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span><span class="oblique">For</span> <span class="oblique">this</span> <i>is</i> <span class="oblique">My covenant with them,</span></span><br /><span class="text Rom-11-27"><span class="oblique">When I take away their sins.&#8221;</span></span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Concerning the gospel <i>they are</i> enemies for your sake, but concerning the election <i>they are</i> beloved for the sake of the fathers. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>For the gifts and the calling of God <i>are</i> irrevocable. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>For as you were once disobedient to God, yet have now obtained mercy through their disobedience, </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>For God has <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>committed them all to disobedience, that He might have mercy on all.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable <i>are</i> His judgments and His ways past finding out!</span></p> <div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line">
