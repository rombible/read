<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>For if Abraham was justified by works, he has <i>something</i> to boast about, but not before God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For what does the Scripture say? <span class="oblique">&#8220;Abraham believed God, and it was</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span><span class="oblique">accounted to him for righteousness.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Now to him who works, the wages are not counted <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>as grace but as debt.</span></p> <h3>
David Celebrates the Same Truth</span></h3><p><span class="text Rom-4-5"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But to him who does not work but believes on Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted for righteousness, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>just as David also describes the blessedness of the man to whom God imputes righteousness apart from works:</span></p> <div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span><span class="oblique">&#8220;Blessed</span> <i>are those</i> <span class="oblique">whose lawless deeds are forgiven,</span></span><br /><span class="text Rom-4-7"><span class="oblique">And whose sins are covered;</span></span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><span class="oblique">Blessed</span> <i>is the</i> <span class="oblique">man to whom the</span> <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <span class="oblique">shall not impute sin.&#8221;</span></span></p></div> <h3>
Abraham Justified Before Circumcision</span></h3><p><span class="text Rom-4-9"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span><i>Does</i> this blessedness then <i>come</i> upon the circumcised <i>only,</i> or upon the uncircumcised also? For we say that faith was accounted to Abraham for righteousness. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>How then was it accounted? While he was circumcised, or uncircumcised? Not while circumcised, but while uncircumcised. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which <i>he had while still</i> uncircumcised, that he might be the father of all those who believe, though they are uncircumcised, that righteousness might be imputed to them also, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>and the father of circumcision to those who not only <i>are</i> of the circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of the faith which our father Abraham <i>had while still</i> uncircumcised.</span></p> <h3>
The Promise Granted Through Faith</span></h3><p><span class="text Rom-4-13"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For the promise that he would be the heir of the world <i>was</i> not to Abraham or to his seed through the law, but through the righteousness of faith. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/4-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For if those who are of the law <i>are</i> heirs, faith is made void and the promise made of no effect, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/4-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>because the law brings about wrath; for where there is no law <i>there is</i> no transgression.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/4-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Therefore <i>it is</i> of faith that <i>it might be</i> according to grace, so that the promise might be <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>sure to all the seed, not only to those who are of the law, but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/4-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>(as it is written, <span class="oblique">&#8220;I have made you a father of many nations&#8221;</span>) in the presence of Him whom he believed&#8212;God, who gives life to the dead and calls those things which do not exist as though they did; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/4-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>who, contrary to hope, in hope believed, so that he became the father of many nations, according to what was spoken, <span class="oblique">&#8220;So shall your descendants be.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/4-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And not being weak in faith, he did not consider his own body, already dead (since he was about a hundred years old), and the deadness of Sarah&#8217;s womb. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/4-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>He did not waver at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/4-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>and being fully convinced that what He had promised He was also able to perform. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/4-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And therefore <span class="oblique">&#8220;it was accounted to him for righteousness.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/4-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/4-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>but also for us. It shall be imputed to us who believe in Him who raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/4-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>who was delivered up because of our offenses, and was raised because of our justification.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-28024a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Romans 4:1">Romans 4:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>(fore)father according to the flesh has found?</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28026b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Romans 4:3">Romans 4:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>imputed, credited, reckoned, counted</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28027c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Romans 4:4">Romans 4:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>according to</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28039d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Romans 4:16">Romans 4:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>certain</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
