What <i>is</i> my iniquity, and what <i>is</i> my sin before your father, that he seeks my life?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So Jonathan said to him, &#8220;By no means! You shall not die! Indeed, my father will do nothing either great or small without first telling me. And why should my father hide this thing from me? It <i>is</i> not <i>so!</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then David took an oath again, and said, &#8220;Your father certainly knows that I have found favor in your eyes, and he has said, &#8216;Do not let Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved.&#8217; But truly, <i>as</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> lives and <i>as</i> your soul lives, <i>there is</i> but a step between me and death.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So Jonathan said to David, &#8220;Whatever you yourself desire, I will do <i>it</i> for you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And David said to Jonathan, &#8220;Indeed tomorrow <i>is</i> the New Moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king to eat. But let me go, that I may hide in the field until the third <i>day</i> at evening. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>If your father misses me at all, then say, &#8216;David earnestly asked <i>permission</i> of me that he might run over to Bethlehem, his city, for <i>there is</i> a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>If he says thus: &#8216;<i>It is</i> well,&#8217; your servant will be safe. But if he is very angry, be sure that evil is determined by him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Therefore you shall deal kindly with your servant, for you have brought your servant into a covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> with you. Nevertheless, if there is iniquity in me, kill me yourself, for why should you bring me to your father?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But Jonathan said, &#8220;Far be it from you! For if I knew certainly that evil was determined by my father to come upon you, then would I not tell you?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then David said to Jonathan, &#8220;Who will tell me, or what <i>if</i> your father answers you roughly?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And Jonathan said to David, &#8220;Come, let us go out into the field.&#8221; So both of them went out into the field. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then Jonathan said to David: &#8220;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel <i>is witness!</i> When I have <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>sounded out my father sometime tomorrow, <i>or</i> the third <i>day,</i> and indeed <i>there is</i> good toward David, and I do not send to you and tell you, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>may the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> do so and much more to Jonathan. But if it pleases my father <i>to do</i> you evil, then I will report it to you and send you away, that you may go in safety. And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> be with you as He has been with my father. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And you shall not only show me the kindness of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> while I still live, that I may not die; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>but you shall not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>cut off your kindness from my <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>house forever, no, not when the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has cut off every one of the enemies of David from the face of the earth.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So Jonathan made <i>a covenant</i> with the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>house of David, <i>saying,</i> &#8220;Let the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> require <i>it</i> at the hand of David&#8217;s enemies.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Now Jonathan again caused David to vow, because he loved him; for he loved him as he loved his own soul. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then Jonathan said to David, &#8220;Tomorrow <i>is</i> the New Moon; and you will be missed, because your seat will be empty. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And <i>when</i> you have stayed three days, go down quickly and come to the place where you hid on the day of the deed; and remain by the stone Ezel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then I will shoot three arrows to the side, as though I shot at a target; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>and there I will send a lad, <i>saying,</i> &#8216;Go, find the arrows.&#8217; If I expressly say to the lad, &#8216;Look, the arrows <i>are</i> on this side of you; get them and come&#8217;&#8212;then, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> lives, <i>there is</i> safety for you and no harm. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But if I say thus to the young man, &#8216;Look, the arrows <i>are</i> beyond you&#8217;&#8212;go your way, for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has sent you away. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And as for the matter which you and I have spoken of, indeed the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>be</i> between you and me forever.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then David hid in the field. And when the New Moon had come, the king sat down to eat the feast. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Now the king sat on his seat, as at other times, on a seat by the wall. And <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul&#8217;s side, but David&#8217;s place was empty. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Nevertheless Saul did not say anything that day, for he thought, &#8220;Something has happened to him; he <i>is</i> unclean, surely he <i>is</i> unclean.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And it happened the next day, the second <i>day</i> of the month, that David&#8217;s place was empty. And Saul said to Jonathan his son, &#8220;Why has the son of Jesse not come to eat, either yesterday or today?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>So Jonathan answered Saul, &#8220;David earnestly asked <i>permission</i> of me <i>to go</i> to Bethlehem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And he said, &#8216;Please let me go, for our family has a sacrifice in the city, and my brother has commanded me <i>to be there.</i> And now, if I have found favor in your eyes, please let me get away and see my brothers.&#8217; Therefore he has not come to the king&#8217;s table.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Then Saul&#8217;s anger was aroused against Jonathan, and he said to him, &#8220;You son of a perverse, rebellious <i>woman!</i> Do I not know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of your mother&#8217;s nakedness? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, you shall not be established, nor your kingdom. Now therefore, send and bring him to me, for he <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>shall surely die.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said to him, &#8220;Why should he be killed? What has he done?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Then Saul cast a spear at him to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>kill him, by which Jonathan knew that it was determined by his father to kill David.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and ate no food the second day of the month, for he was grieved for David, because his father had treated him shamefully.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>And so it was, in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad <i>was</i> with him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Then he said to his lad, &#8220;Now run, find the arrows which I shoot.&#8221; As the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>When the lad had come to the place where the arrow was which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried out after the lad and said, &#8220;<i>Is</i> not the arrow beyond you?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>And Jonathan cried out after the lad, &#8220;Make haste, hurry, do not delay!&#8221; So Jonathan&#8217;s lad gathered up the arrows and came back to his master. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>But the lad did not know anything. Only Jonathan and David knew of the matter. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>Then Jonathan gave his <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>weapons to his lad, and said to him, &#8220;Go, carry <i>them</i> to the city.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>As soon as the lad had gone, David arose from <i>a place</i> toward the south, fell on his face to the ground, and bowed down three times. And they kissed one another; and they wept together, but David more so. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>Then Jonathan said to David, &#8220;Go in peace, since we have both sworn in the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, saying, &#8216;May the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> be between you and me, and between your descendants and my descendants, forever.&#8217; &#8221; So he arose and departed, and Jonathan went into the city.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-7743a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 20:12">1 Samuel 20:12</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>searched out</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7746b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 20:15">1 Samuel 20:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>stop being kind</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7746c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 20:15">1 Samuel 20:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>family</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7747d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 20:16">1 Samuel 20:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>family</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7756e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 20:25">1 Samuel 20:25</span> <span class='footnote-text'>So with MT, Syr., Tg., Vg.; LXX <i>he sat across from Jonathan</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7762f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 20:31">1 Samuel 20:31</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>is a son of death</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7764g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 20:33">1 Samuel 20:33</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>strike him down</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7771h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 20:40">1 Samuel 20:40</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>equipment</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
