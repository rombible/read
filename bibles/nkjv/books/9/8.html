<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>The name of his firstborn was Joel, and the name of his second, Abijah; <i>they were</i> judges in Beersheba. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But his sons did not walk in his ways; they turned aside after dishonest gain, took bribes, and perverted justice.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and said to him, &#8220;Look, you are old, and your sons do not walk in your ways. Now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But the thing displeased Samuel when they said, &#8220;Give us a king to judge us.&#8221; So Samuel prayed to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Samuel, &#8220;Heed the voice of the people in all that they say to you; for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected Me, that I should not reign over them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt, even to this day&#8212;with which they have forsaken Me and served other gods&#8212;so they are doing to you also. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Now therefore, heed their voice. However, you shall solemnly forewarn them, and show them the behavior of the king who will reign over them.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So Samuel told all the words of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> to the people who asked him for a king. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;This will be the behavior of the king who will reign over you: He will take your sons and appoint <i>them</i> for his own chariots and <i>to be</i> his horsemen, and <i>some</i> will run before his chariots. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>He will appoint captains over his thousands and captains over his fifties, <i>will set some</i> to plow his ground and reap his harvest, and <i>some</i> to make his weapons of war and equipment for his chariots. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>He will take your daughters <i>to be</i> perfumers, cooks, and bakers. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And he will take the best of your fields, your vineyards, and your olive groves, and give <i>them</i> to his servants. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>He will take a tenth of your grain and your vintage, and give it to his officers and servants. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And he will take your male servants, your female servants, your finest <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>young men, and your donkeys, and put <i>them</i> to his work. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>He will take a tenth of your sheep. And you will be his servants. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And you will cry out in that day because of your king whom you have chosen for yourselves, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will not hear you in that day.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, &#8220;No, but we will have a king over us, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he repeated them in the hearing of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Samuel, &#8220;Heed their voice, and make them a king.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-8-22">And Samuel said to the men of Israel, &#8220;Every man go to his city.&#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-7386a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 8:16">1 Samuel 8:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>LXX <i>cattle</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
