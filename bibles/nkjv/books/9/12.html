<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And now here is the king, walking before you; and I am old and grayheaded, and look, my sons <i>are</i> with you. I have walked before you from my childhood to this day. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Here I am. Witness against me before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and before His anointed: Whose ox have I taken, or whose donkey have I taken, or whom have I cheated? Whom have I oppressed, or from whose hand have I received <i>any</i> bribe with which to blind my eyes? I will restore <i>it</i> to you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And they said, &#8220;You have not cheated us or oppressed us, nor have you taken anything from any man&#8217;s hand.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then he said to them, &#8220;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>is</i> witness against you, and His anointed <i>is</i> witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-12-5">And they answered, &#8220;<i>He is</i> witness.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then Samuel said to the people, &#8220;<i>It is</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> who raised up Moses and Aaron, and who brought your fathers up from the land of Egypt. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now therefore, stand still, that I may reason with you before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> concerning all the righteous acts of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> which He did to you and your fathers: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>When Jacob had gone into <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>Egypt, and your fathers cried out to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> sent Moses and Aaron, who brought your fathers out of Egypt and made them dwell in this place. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And when they forgot the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> their God, He sold them into the hand of Sisera, commander of the army of Hazor, into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab; and they fought against them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then they cried out to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and said, &#8216;We have sinned, because we have forsaken the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and served the Baals and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Ashtoreths; but now deliver us from the hand of our enemies, and we will serve You.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> sent <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>Jerubbaal, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>Bedan, Jephthah, and Samuel,<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span> and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side; and you dwelt in safety. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And when you saw that Nahash king of the Ammonites came against you, you said to me, &#8216;No, but a king shall reign over us,&#8217; when the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God <i>was</i> your king.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8220;Now therefore, here is the king whom you have chosen <i>and</i> whom you have desired. And take note, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has set a king over you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>If you fear the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and serve Him and obey His voice, and do not rebel against the commandment of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, then both you and the king who reigns over you will continue following the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>However, if you do not obey the voice of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, but rebel against the commandment of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, then the hand of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will be against you, as <i>it was</i> against your fathers.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>&#8220;Now therefore, stand and see this great thing which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will do before your eyes: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span><i>Is</i> today not the wheat harvest? I will call to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and He will send thunder and rain, that you may perceive and see that your wickedness <i>is</i> great, which you have done in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, in asking a king for yourselves.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>So Samuel called to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> sent thunder and rain that day; and all the people greatly feared the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and Samuel.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And all the people said to Samuel, &#8220;Pray for your servants to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God, that we may not die; for we have added to all our sins the evil of asking a king for ourselves.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then Samuel said to the people, &#8220;Do not fear. You have done all this wickedness; yet do not turn aside from following the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, but serve the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> with all your heart. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And do not turn aside; for <i>then you would go</i> after empty things which cannot profit or deliver, for they <i>are</i> nothing. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>For the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will not forsake His people, for His great name&#8217;s sake, because it has pleased the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> to make you His people. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Moreover, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> in ceasing to pray for you; but I will teach you the good and the right way. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Only fear the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and serve Him in truth with all your heart; for consider what great things He has done for you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>But if you still do wickedly, you shall be swept away, both you and your king.&#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-7462a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 12:1">1 Samuel 12:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>listened to</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7469b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 12:8">1 Samuel 12:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'>So with MT, Tg., Vg.; LXX adds <i>and the Egyptians afflicted them</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7471c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 12:10">1 Samuel 12:10</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Images of Canaanite goddesses</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7472d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 12:11">1 Samuel 12:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Gideon, cf. <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Judg.6.25-Judg.6.32" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=Judg.6.25-Judg.6.32&amp;version=NKJV">Judg. 6:25&#8211;32</span>; Syr. <i>Deborah;</i> Tg. <i>Gideon</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7472e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 12:11">1 Samuel 12:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>LXX, Syr. <i>Barak;</i> Tg. <i>Simson</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7472f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 12:11">1 Samuel 12:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Syr. <i>Simson</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
