<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he had two wives: the name of one <i>was</i> Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>This man went up from his city yearly to worship and sacrifice to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts in Shiloh. Also the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, <i>were</i> there. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And whenever the time came for Elkanah to make an offering, he would give portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and daughters. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But to Hannah he would give a double portion, for he loved Hannah, although the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had closed her womb. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And her rival also provoked her severely, to make her miserable, because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had closed her womb. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So it was, year by year, when she went up to the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, that she provoked her; therefore she wept and did not eat.</span></p> <h3>
Hannah&#8217;s Vow</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Sam-1-8"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then Elkanah her husband said to her, &#8220;Hannah, why do you weep? Why do you not eat? And why is your heart grieved? <i>Am</i> I not better to you than ten sons?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So Hannah arose after they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat by the doorpost of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>tabernacle of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And she <i>was</i> in bitterness of soul, and prayed to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>wept in anguish. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then she made a vow and said, &#8220;O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts, if You will indeed look on the affliction of Your maidservant and remember me, and not forget Your maidservant, but will give Your maidservant a male child, then I will give him to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> all the days of his life, and no razor shall come upon his head.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And it happened, as she continued praying before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, that Eli watched her mouth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Now Hannah spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli thought she was drunk. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So Eli said to her, &#8220;How long will you be drunk? Put your wine away from you!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But Hannah answered and said, &#8220;No, my lord, I <i>am</i> a woman of sorrowful spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor intoxicating drink, but have poured out my soul before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Do not consider your maidservant a wicked<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span> woman, for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief I have spoken until now.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then Eli answered and said, &#8220;Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant your petition which you have asked of Him.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And she said, &#8220;Let your maidservant find favor in your sight.&#8221; So the woman went her way and ate, and her face was no longer <i>sad.</i></span></p> <h3>
Samuel Is Born and Dedicated</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Sam-1-19"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then they rose early in the morning and worshiped before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and returned and came to their house at Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> remembered her. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So it came to pass in the process of time that Hannah conceived and bore a son, and called his name <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>Samuel, <i>saying,</i> &#8220;Because I have asked for him from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Now the man Elkanah and all his house went up to offer to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> the yearly sacrifice and his vow. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, &#8220;<i>Not</i> until the child is weaned; then I will take him, that he may appear before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and remain there forever.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>So Elkanah her husband said to her, &#8220;Do what seems best to you; wait until you have weaned him. Only let the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>establish <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>His word.&#8221; Then the woman stayed and nursed her son until she had weaned him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Now when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>three bulls, one ephah of flour, and a skin of wine, and brought him to the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> in Shiloh. And the child <i>was</i> young. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then they slaughtered a bull, and brought the child to Eli. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And she said, &#8220;O my lord! As your soul lives, my lord, I <i>am</i> the woman who stood by you here, praying to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>For this child I prayed, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has granted me my petition which I asked of Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Therefore I also have lent him to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; as long as he lives he shall be <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>lent to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221; So they worshiped the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> there.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-7214a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 1:1">1 Samuel 1:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Eliel,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="1Chr.6.34" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=1Chr.6.34&amp;version=NKJV">1 Chr. 6:34</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7214b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 1:1">1 Samuel 1:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Toah,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="1Chr.6.34" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=1Chr.6.34&amp;version=NKJV">1 Chr. 6:34</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7222c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 1:9">1 Samuel 1:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>palace</i> or <i>temple,</i> Heb. <i>heykal</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7223d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 1:10">1 Samuel 1:10</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>wept greatly</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7229e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 1:16">1 Samuel 1:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>daughter of Belial</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7233f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 1:20">1 Samuel 1:20</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Heard by God</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7236g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 1:23">1 Samuel 1:23</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>confirm</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7236h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 1:23">1 Samuel 1:23</span> <span class='footnote-text'>So with MT, Tg., Vg.; DSS, LXX, Syr. <i>your</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7237i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 1:24">1 Samuel 1:24</span> <span class='footnote-text'>DSS, LXX, Syr. <i>a three-year-old bull</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7241j"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 1:28">1 Samuel 1:28</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>granted</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
