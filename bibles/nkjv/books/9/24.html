David <i>is</i> in the Wilderness of En Gedi.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then Saul took three thousand chosen men from all Israel, and went to seek David and his men on the Rocks of the Wild Goats. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So he came to the sheepfolds by the road, where there <i>was</i> a cave; and Saul went in to attend to his needs. (David and his men were staying in the recesses of the cave.) </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then the men of David said to him, &#8220;This is the day of which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to you, &#8216;Behold, I will deliver your enemy into your hand, that you may do to him as it seems good to you.&#8217; &#8221; And David arose and secretly cut off a corner of Saul&#8217;s robe. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now it happened afterward that David&#8217;s heart troubled him because he had cut Saul&#8217;s robe. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And he said to his men, &#8220;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> forbid that I should do this thing to my master, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s anointed, to stretch out my hand against him, seeing he <i>is</i> the anointed of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So David restrained his servants with <i>these</i> words, and did not allow them to rise against Saul. And Saul got up from the cave and went on <i>his</i> way.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>David also arose afterward, went out of the cave, and called out to Saul, saying, &#8220;My lord the king!&#8221; And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed down. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And David said to Saul: &#8220;Why do you listen to the words of men who say, &#8216;Indeed David seeks your harm&#8217;? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Look, this day your eyes have seen that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> delivered you today into my hand in the cave, and <i>someone</i> urged <i>me</i> to kill you. But <i>my eye</i> spared you, and I said, &#8216;I will not stretch out my hand against my lord, for he <i>is</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s anointed.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Moreover, my father, see! Yes, see the corner of your robe in my hand! For in that I cut off the corner of your robe, and did not kill you, know and see that <i>there is</i> neither evil nor rebellion in my hand, and I have not sinned against you. Yet you hunt my life to take it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Let the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> judge between you and me, and let the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> avenge me on you. But my hand shall not be against you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>As the proverb of the ancients says, &#8216;Wickedness proceeds from the wicked.&#8217; But my hand shall not be against you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>After whom has the king of Israel come out? Whom do you pursue? A dead dog? A flea? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Therefore let the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> be judge, and judge between you and me, and see and plead my case, and deliver me out of your hand.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So it was, when David had finished speaking these words to Saul, that Saul said, &#8220;<i>Is</i> this your voice, my son David?&#8221; And Saul lifted up his voice and wept. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then he said to David: &#8220;You <i>are</i> more righteous than I; for you have rewarded me with good, whereas I have rewarded you with evil. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And you have shown this day how you have dealt well with me; for when the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> delivered me into your hand, you did not kill me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him get away safely? Therefore may the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> reward you with good for what you have done to me this day. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And now I know indeed that you shall surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hand. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Therefore swear now to me by the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> that you will not cut off my descendants after me, and that you will not destroy my name from my father&#8217;s house.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So David swore to Saul. And Saul went home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold.</span></p> </div></div></body></html>
