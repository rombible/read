<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/29-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And the lords of the Philistines <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>passed in review by hundreds and by thousands, but David and his men passed in review at the rear with Achish. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/29-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then the princes of the Philistines said, &#8220;What <i>are</i> these Hebrews <i>doing here?</i>&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-29-3">And Achish said to the princes of the Philistines, &#8220;<i>Is</i> this not David, the servant of Saul king of Israel, who has been with me these days, or these years? And to this day I have found no fault in him since he defected <i>to me.</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/29-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But the princes of the Philistines were angry with him; so the princes of the Philistines said to him, &#8220;Make this fellow return, that he may go back to the place which you have appointed for him, and do not let him go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he become our adversary. For with what could he reconcile himself to his master, if not with the heads of these men? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/29-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span><i>Is</i> this not David, of whom they sang to one another in dances, saying:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text 1Sam-29-5">&#8216;Saul has slain his thousands,</span><br /><span class="text 1Sam-29-5">And David his ten thousands&#8217;?&#8221;</span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/29-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then Achish called David and said to him, &#8220;Surely, <i>as</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> lives, you have been upright, and your going out and your coming in with me in the army <i>is</i> good in my sight. For to this day I have not found evil in you since the day of your coming to me. Nevertheless the lords do not favor you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/29-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Therefore return now, and go in peace, that you may not displease the lords of the Philistines.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/29-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So David said to Achish, &#8220;But what have I done? And to this day what have you found in your servant as long as I have been with you, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/29-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then Achish answered and said to David, &#8220;I know that you <i>are</i> as good in my sight as an angel of God; nevertheless the princes of the Philistines have said, &#8216;He shall not go up with us to the battle.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/29-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Now therefore, rise early in the morning with your master&#8217;s servants who have come with <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>you. And as soon as you are up early in the morning and have light, depart.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/29-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So David and his men rose early to depart in the morning, to return to the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-7970a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 29:2">1 Samuel 29:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>passed on in the rear</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7978b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 29:10">1 Samuel 29:10</span> <span class='footnote-text'>So with MT, Tg., Vg.; LXX adds <i>and go to the place which I have selected for you there; and set no bothersome word in your heart, for you are good before me.
