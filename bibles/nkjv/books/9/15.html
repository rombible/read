Now therefore, heed the voice of the words of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts: &#8216;I will punish Amalek <i>for</i> what he did to Israel, how he ambushed him on the way when he came up from Egypt. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Now go and attack<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span> Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and do not spare them. But kill both man and woman, infant and nursing child, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So Saul gathered the people together and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand men of Judah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and lay in wait in the valley.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then Saul said to the Kenites, &#8220;Go, depart, get down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them. For you showed kindness to all the children of Israel when they came up out of Egypt.&#8221; So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And Saul attacked the Amalekites, from Havilah all the way to Shur, which is east of Egypt. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>He also took Agag king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the sheep, the oxen, the fatlings, the lambs, and all <i>that was</i> good, and were unwilling to utterly destroy them. But everything despised and worthless, that they utterly destroyed.</span></p> <h3>
Saul Rejected as King</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Sam-15-10"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Now the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came to Samuel, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8220;I greatly regret that I have set up Saul <i>as</i> king, for he has turned back from following Me, and has not performed My commandments.&#8221; And it grieved Samuel, and he cried out to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> all night. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So when Samuel rose early in the morning to meet Saul, it was told Samuel, saying, &#8220;Saul went to Carmel, and indeed, he set up a monument for himself; and he has gone on around, passed by, and gone down to Gilgal.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then Samuel went to Saul, and Saul said to him, &#8220;Blessed <i>are</i> you of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>! I have performed the commandment of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But Samuel said, &#8220;What then <i>is</i> this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And Saul said, &#8220;They have brought them from the Amalekites; for the people spared the best of the sheep and the oxen, to sacrifice to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then Samuel said to Saul, &#8220;Be quiet! And I will tell you what the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to me last night.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-15-16">And he said to him, &#8220;Speak on.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So Samuel said, &#8220;When you <i>were</i> little in your own eyes, <i>were</i> you not head of the tribes of Israel? And did not the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> anoint you king over Israel? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Now the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> sent you on a mission, and said, &#8216;Go, and utterly destroy the sinners, the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>consumed.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Why then did you not obey the voice of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>? Why did you swoop down on the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>spoil, and do evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And Saul said to Samuel, &#8220;But I have obeyed the voice of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and gone on the mission on which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> sent me, and brought back Agag king of Amalek; I have utterly destroyed the Amalekites. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>But the people took of the plunder, sheep and oxen, the best of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God in Gilgal.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So Samuel said:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text 1Sam-15-22">&#8220;Has the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>as great</i> delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices,</span><br /><span class="text 1Sam-15-22">As in obeying the voice of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>?</span><br /><span class="text 1Sam-15-22">Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice,</span><br /><span class="text 1Sam-15-22"><i>And</i> to heed than the fat of rams.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>For rebellion <i>is as</i> the sin of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>witchcraft,</span><br /><span class="text 1Sam-15-23">And stubbornness <i>is as</i> iniquity and idolatry.</span><br /><span class="text 1Sam-15-23">Because you have rejected the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>,</span><br /><span class="text 1Sam-15-23">He also has rejected you from <i>being</i> king.&#8221;</span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then Saul said to Samuel, &#8220;I have sinned, for I have transgressed the commandment of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and your words, because I feared the people and obeyed their voice. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Now therefore, please pardon my sin, and return with me, that I may worship the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>But Samuel said to Saul, &#8220;I will not return with you, for you have rejected the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has rejected you from being king over Israel.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And as Samuel turned around to go away, <i>Saul</i> seized the edge of his robe, and it tore. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>So Samuel said to him, &#8220;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today, and has given it to a neighbor of yours, <i>who is</i> better than you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor relent. For He <i>is</i> not a man, that He should relent.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Then he said, &#8220;I have sinned; <i>yet</i> honor me now, please, before the elders of my people and before Israel, and return with me, that I may worship the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>So Samuel turned back after Saul, and Saul worshiped the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Then Samuel said, &#8220;Bring Agag king of the Amalekites here to me.&#8221; So Agag came to him cautiously.</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-15-32">And Agag said, &#8220;Surely the bitterness of death is past.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>But Samuel said, &#8220;As your sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women.&#8221; And Samuel hacked Agag in pieces before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> in Gilgal.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Then Samuel went to Ramah, and Saul went up to his house at Gibeah of Saul. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>And Samuel went no more to see Saul until the day of his death.
