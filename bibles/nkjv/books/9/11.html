<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, &#8220;On this <i>condition</i> I will make <i>a covenant</i> with you, that I may put out all your right eyes, and bring reproach on all Israel.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then the elders of Jabesh said to him, &#8220;Hold off for seven days, that we may send messengers to all the territory of Israel. And then, if <i>there is</i> no one to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>save us, we will come out to you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and told the news in the hearing of the people. And all the people lifted up their voices and wept. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now there was Saul, coming behind the herd from the field; and Saul said, &#8220;What <i>troubles</i> the people, that they weep?&#8221; And they told him the words of the men of Jabesh. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard this news, and his anger was greatly aroused. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So he took a yoke of oxen and cut them in pieces, and sent <i>them</i> throughout all the territory of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, &#8220;Whoever does not go out with Saul and Samuel to battle, so it shall be done to his oxen.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-11-7">And the fear of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> fell on the people, and they came out <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>with one consent. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>When he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And they said to the messengers who came, &#8220;Thus you shall say to the men of Jabesh Gilead: &#8216;Tomorrow, by <i>the time</i> the sun is hot, you shall have help.&#8217; &#8221; Then the messengers came and reported <i>it</i> to the men of Jabesh, and they were glad. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Therefore the men of Jabesh said, &#8220;Tomorrow we will come out to you, and you may do with us whatever seems good to you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So it was, on the next day, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and killed Ammonites until the heat of the day. And it happened that those who survived were scattered, so that no two of them were left together.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then the people said to Samuel, &#8220;Who <i>is</i> he who said, &#8216;Shall Saul reign over us?&#8217; Bring the men, that we may put them to death.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>But Saul said, &#8220;Not a man shall be put to death this day, for today the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has accomplished salvation in Israel.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then Samuel said to the people, &#8220;Come, let us go to Gilgal and renew the kingdom there.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So all the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul king before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> in Gilgal. There they made sacrifices of peace offerings before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-7447a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 11:1">1 Samuel 11:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>besieged</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7449b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 11:3">1 Samuel 11:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>deliver</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7453c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 11:7">1 Samuel 11:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>as one man</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
