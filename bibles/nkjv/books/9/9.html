<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he had a choice and handsome son whose name <i>was</i> Saul. <i>There was</i> not a more handsome person than he among the children of Israel. From his shoulders upward <i>he was</i> taller than any of the people.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Now the donkeys of Kish, Saul&#8217;s father, were lost. And Kish said to his son Saul, &#8220;Please take one of the servants with you, and arise, go and look for the donkeys.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So he passed through the mountains of Ephraim and through the land of Shalisha, but they did not find <i>them.</i> Then they passed through the land of Shaalim, and <i>they were</i> not <i>there.</i> Then he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they did not find <i>them.</i></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>When they had come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who <i>was</i> with him, &#8220;Come, let us return, lest my father cease <i>caring</i> about the donkeys and become worried about us.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And he said to him, &#8220;Look now, <i>there is</i> in this city a man of God, and <i>he is</i> an honorable man; all that he says surely comes to pass. So let us go there; perhaps he can show us the way that we should go.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then Saul said to his servant, &#8220;But look, <i>if</i> we go, what shall we bring the man? For the bread in our vessels is all gone, and <i>there is</i> no present to bring to the man of God. What do we have?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And the servant answered Saul again and said, &#8220;Look, I have here at hand one-fourth of a shekel of silver. I will give <i>that</i> to the man of God, to tell us our way.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>(Formerly in Israel, when a man went <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>to inquire of God, he spoke thus: &#8220;Come, let us go to the seer&#8221;; for <i>he who is</i> now <i>called</i> a prophet was formerly called a seer.)</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then Saul said to his servant, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>&#8220;Well said; come, let us go.&#8221; So they went to the city where the man of God <i>was.</i></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>As they went up the hill to the city, they met some young women going out to draw water, and said to them, &#8220;Is the seer here?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And they answered them and said, &#8220;Yes, there he is, just ahead of you. Hurry now; for today he came to this city, because there is a sacrifice of the people today on the high place. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>As soon as you come into the city, you will surely find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. For the people will not eat until he comes, because he must bless the sacrifice; afterward those who are invited will eat. Now therefore, go up, for about this time you will find him.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So they went up to the city. As they were coming into the city, there was Samuel, coming out toward them on his way up to the high place.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Now the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had told Samuel in his ear the day before Saul came, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>&#8220;Tomorrow about this time I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>commander over My people Israel, that he may save My people from the hand of the Philistines; for I have looked upon My people, because their cry has come to Me.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So when Samuel saw Saul, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to him, &#8220;There he is, the man of whom I spoke to you. This one shall reign over My people.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, &#8220;Please tell me, where <i>is</i> the seer&#8217;s house?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Samuel answered Saul and said, &#8220;I <i>am</i> the seer. Go up before me to the high place, for you shall eat with me today; and tomorrow I will let you go and will tell you all that <i>is</i> in your heart. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>But as for your donkeys that were lost three days ago, do not be anxious about them, for they have been found. And <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>on whom <i>is</i> all the desire of Israel? <i>Is it</i> not on you and on all your father&#8217;s house?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And Saul answered and said, &#8220;<i>Am</i> I not a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel, and my family the least of all the families of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>tribe of Benjamin? Why then do you speak like this to me?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Now Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them into the hall, and had them sit in the place of honor among those who were invited; there <i>were</i> about thirty persons. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And Samuel said to the cook, &#8220;Bring the portion which I gave you, of which I said to you, &#8216;Set it apart.&#8217; &#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>So the cook took up the thigh with its upper part and set <i>it</i> before Saul. And <i>Samuel</i> said, &#8220;Here it is, what was kept back. <i>It</i> was set apart for you. Eat; for until this time it has been kept for you, since I said I invited the people.&#8221; So Saul ate with Samuel that day.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>When they had come down from the high place into the city, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span><i>Samuel</i> spoke with Saul on the top of the house. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>They arose early; and it was about the dawning of the day that Samuel called to Saul on the top of the house, saying, &#8220;Get up, that I may send you on your way.&#8221; And Saul arose, and both of them went outside, he and Samuel.</span></p> <h3>
