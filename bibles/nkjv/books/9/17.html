<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and they encamped in the Valley of Elah, and drew up in battle array against the Philistines. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>The Philistines stood on a mountain on one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side, with a valley between them.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And a champion went out from the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, from Gath, whose height <i>was</i> six cubits and a span. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span><i>He had</i> a bronze helmet on his head, and he <i>was</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>armed with a coat of mail, and the weight of the coat <i>was</i> five thousand shekels of bronze. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And <i>he had</i> bronze armor on his legs and a bronze javelin between his shoulders. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now the staff of his spear <i>was</i> like a weaver&#8217;s beam, and his iron spearhead <i>weighed</i> six hundred shekels; and a shield-bearer went before him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then he stood and cried out to the armies of Israel, and said to them, &#8220;Why have you come out to line up for battle? <i>Am</i> I not a Philistine, and you the servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves, and let him come down to me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will be your servants. But if I prevail against him and kill him, then you shall be our servants and serve us.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And the Philistine said, &#8220;I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now David <i>was</i> the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehem Judah, whose name <i>was</i> Jesse, and who had eight sons. And the man was old, advanced <i>in years,</i> in the days of Saul. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>The three oldest sons of Jesse had gone to follow Saul to the battle. The names of his three sons who went to the battle <i>were</i> Eliab the firstborn, next to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>David <i>was</i> the youngest. And the three oldest followed Saul. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But David occasionally went and returned from Saul to feed his father&#8217;s sheep at Bethlehem.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And the Philistine drew near and presented himself forty days, morning and evening.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then Jesse said to his son David, &#8220;Take now for your brothers an ephah of this dried <i>grain</i> and these ten loaves, and run to your brothers at the camp. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And carry these ten cheeses to the captain of <i>their</i> thousand, and see how your brothers fare, and bring back news of them.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Now Saul and they and all the men of Israel <i>were</i> in the Valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So David rose early in the morning, left the sheep with a keeper, and took <i>the things</i> and went as Jesse had commanded him. And he came to the camp as the army was going out to the fight and shouting for the battle. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>For Israel and the Philistines had drawn up in battle array, army against army. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And David left his supplies in the hand of the supply keeper, ran to the army, and came and greeted his brothers. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Then as he talked with them, there was the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, coming up from the armies of the Philistines; and he spoke according to the same words. So David heard <i>them.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him and were dreadfully afraid. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>So the men of Israel said, &#8220;Have you seen this man who has come up? Surely he has come up to defy Israel; and it shall be <i>that</i> the man who kills him the king will enrich with great riches, will give him his daughter, and give his father&#8217;s house exemption <i>from taxes</i> in Israel.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Then David spoke to the men who stood by him, saying, &#8220;What shall be done for the man who kills this Philistine and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who <i>is</i> this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And the people answered him in this manner, saying, &#8220;So shall it be done for the man who kills him.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Now Eliab his oldest brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab&#8217;s anger was aroused against David, and he said, &#8220;Why did you come down here? And with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride and the insolence of your heart, for you have come down to see the battle.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And David said, &#8220;What have I done now? <i>Is</i><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span> <i>there</i> not a cause?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Then he turned from him toward another and said the same thing; and these people answered him as the first ones <i>did.</i></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Now when the words which David spoke were heard, they reported <i>them</i> to Saul; and he sent for him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Then David said to Saul, &#8220;Let no man&#8217;s heart fail because of him; your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And Saul said to David, &#8220;You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for you <i>are</i> a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>But David said to Saul, &#8220;Your servant used to keep his father&#8217;s sheep, and when a lion or a bear came and took a lamb out of the flock, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>I went out after it and struck it, and delivered <i>the lamb</i> from its mouth; and when it arose against me, I caught <i>it</i> by its beard, and struck and killed it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Your servant has killed both lion and bear; and this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, seeing he has defied the armies of the living God.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>Moreover David said, &#8220;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear, He will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-17-37">And Saul said to David, &#8220;Go, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> be with you!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>So Saul clothed David with his <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>armor, and he put a bronze helmet on his head; he also clothed him with a coat of mail. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>David fastened his sword to his armor and tried to walk, for he had not tested <i>them.</i> And David said to Saul, &#8220;I cannot walk with these, for I have not tested <i>them.</i>&#8221; So David took them off.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>Then he took his staff in his hand; and he chose for himself five smooth stones from the brook, and put them in a shepherd&#8217;s bag, in a pouch which he had, and his sling was in his hand. And he drew near to the Philistine. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>So the Philistine came, and began drawing near to David, and the man who bore the shield <i>went</i> before him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>And when the Philistine looked about and saw David, he disdained<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span> him; for he was <i>only</i> a youth, ruddy and good-looking. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>So the Philistine said to David, &#8220;<i>Am</i> I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?&#8221; And the Philistine cursed David by his gods. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>And the Philistine said to David, &#8220;Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>Then David said to the Philistine, &#8220;You come to me with a sword, with a spear, and with a javelin. But I come to you in the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span>This day the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you and take your head from you. And this day I will give the carcasses of the camp of the Philistines to the birds of the air and the wild beasts of the earth, that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-47.htm"><b>47</b></a></span>Then all this assembly shall know that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> does not save with sword and spear; for the battle <i>is</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s, and He will give you into our hands.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-48.htm"><b>48</b></a></span>So it was, when the Philistine arose and came and drew near to meet David, that David hurried and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-49.htm"><b>49</b></a></span>Then David put his hand in his bag and took out a stone; and he slung <i>it</i> and struck the Philistine in his forehead, so that the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the earth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-50.htm"><b>50</b></a></span>So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone, and struck the Philistine and killed him. But <i>there was</i> no sword in the hand of David. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-51.htm"><b>51</b></a></span>Therefore David ran and stood over the Philistine, took his sword and drew it out of its sheath and killed him, and cut off his head with it.</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-17-51">And when the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-52.htm"><b>52</b></a></span>Now the men of Israel and Judah arose and shouted, and pursued the Philistines as far as the entrance of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>the valley and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell along the road to Shaaraim, even as far as Gath and Ekron. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-53.htm"><b>53</b></a></span>Then the children of Israel returned from chasing the Philistines, and they plundered their tents. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-54.htm"><b>54</b></a></span>And David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put his armor in his tent.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-55.htm"><b>55</b></a></span>When Saul saw David going out against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the commander of the army, &#8220;Abner, whose son <i>is</i> this youth?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-17-55">And Abner said, &#8220;As your soul lives, O king, I do not know.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-56.htm"><b>56</b></a></span>So the king said, &#8220;Inquire whose son this young man <i>is.</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-57.htm"><b>57</b></a></span>Then, as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-58.htm"><b>58</b></a></span>And Saul said to him, &#8220;Whose son <i>are</i> you, young man?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-17-58">So David answered, &#8220;<i>I am</i> the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.&#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-7624a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 17:5">1 Samuel 17:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>clothed with scaled body armor</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7648b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 17:29">1 Samuel 17:29</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Is it not a word?</i> or <i>matter?</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7657c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 17:38">1 Samuel 17:38</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>clothes</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7661d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 17:42">1 Samuel 17:42</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>belittled</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7671e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 17:52">1 Samuel 17:52</span> <span class='footnote-text'>So with MT, Syr., Tg., Vg.; LXX <i>Gath</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
