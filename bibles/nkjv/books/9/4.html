<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then the Philistines put themselves in battle array against Israel. And when they joined battle, Israel was <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand men of the army in the field. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And when the people had come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, &#8220;Why has the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> defeated us today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> from Shiloh to us, that when it comes among us it may save us from the hand of our enemies.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from there the ark of the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts, who dwells <i>between</i> the cherubim. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, <i>were</i> there with the ark of the covenant of God.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And when the ark of the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came into the camp, all Israel shouted so loudly that the earth shook. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, &#8220;What <i>does</i> the sound of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews <i>mean?</i>&#8221; Then they understood that the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had come into the camp. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So the Philistines were afraid, for they said, &#8220;God has come into the camp!&#8221; And they said, &#8220;Woe to us! For such a thing has never happened before. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Woe to us! Who will deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? These <i>are</i> the gods who struck the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Be strong and conduct yourselves like men, you Philistines, that you do not become servants of the Hebrews, as they have been to you. <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Conduct yourselves like men, and fight!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So the Philistines fought, and Israel was <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>defeated, and every man fled to his tent. There was a very great slaughter, and there fell of Israel thirty thousand foot soldiers. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Also the ark of God was captured; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, died.</span></p> <h3>
Death of Eli</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Sam-4-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then a man of Benjamin ran from the battle line the same day, and came to Shiloh with his clothes torn and dirt on his head. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Now when he came, there was Eli, sitting on a seat <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>by the wayside watching, for his heart <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city and told <i>it,</i> all the city cried out. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>When Eli heard the noise of the outcry, he said, &#8220;What <i>does</i> the sound of this tumult <i>mean?</i>&#8221; And the man came quickly and told Eli. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Eli was ninety-eight years old, and his eyes were so <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>dim that he could not see.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then the man said to Eli, &#8220;I <i>am</i> he who came from the battle. And I fled today from the battle line.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-4-16">And he said, &#8220;What happened, my son?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So the messenger answered and said, &#8220;Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has been a great slaughter among the people. Also your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead; and the ark of God has been captured.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then it happened, when he made mention of the ark of God, that Eli fell off the seat backward by the side of the gate; and his neck was broken and he died, for the man was old and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.</span></p> <h3>
Ichabod</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Sam-4-19"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Now his daughter-in-law, Phinehas&#8217; wife, was with child, <i>due</i> to be delivered; and when she heard the news that the ark of God was captured, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and gave birth, for her labor pains came upon her. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And about the time of her death the women who stood by her said to her, &#8220;Do not fear, for you have borne a son.&#8221; But she did not answer, nor did she <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>regard <i>it.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then she named the child Ichabod,<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span> saying, &#8220;The glory has departed from Israel!&#8221; because the ark of God had been captured and because of her father-in-law and her husband. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And she said, &#8220;The glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God has been captured.&#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-7299a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 4:1">1 Samuel 4:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>So with MT, Tg.; LXX, Vg. add <i>And it came to pass in those days that the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight;</i> LXX adds further <i>against Israel</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7300b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 4:2">1 Samuel 4:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>struck</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7307c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 4:9">1 Samuel 4:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Be men</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7308d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 4:10">1 Samuel 4:10</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>struck down</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7311e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 4:13">1 Samuel 4:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'>So with MT, Vg.; LXX <i>beside the gate watching the road</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7311f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 4:13">1 Samuel 4:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>trembled with anxiety</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7313g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 4:15">1 Samuel 4:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>fixed</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7318h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 4:20">1 Samuel 4:20</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>pay any attention to</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7319i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 4:21">1 Samuel 4:21</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Inglorious</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
