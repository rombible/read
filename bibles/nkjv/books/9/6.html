<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, &#8220;What shall we do with the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>? Tell us how we should send it to its place.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So they said, &#8220;If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, do not send it empty; but by all means return <i>it</i> to Him <i>with</i> a trespass offering. Then you will be healed, and it will be known to you why His hand is not removed from you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then they said, &#8220;What <i>is</i> the trespass offering which we shall return to Him?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-6-4">They answered, &#8220;Five golden tumors and five golden rats, <i>according to</i> the number of the lords of the Philistines. For the same plague <i>was</i> on all of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>you and on your lords. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Therefore you shall make images of your tumors and images of your rats that ravage the land, and you shall give glory to the God of Israel; perhaps He will lighten<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span> His hand from you, from your gods, and from your land. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Why then do you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When He did mighty things among them, did they not let the people go, that they might depart? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now therefore, make a new cart, take two milk cows which have never been yoked, and hitch the cows to the cart; and take their calves home, away from them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then take the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and set it on the cart; and put the articles of gold which you are returning to Him <i>as</i> a trespass offering in a chest by its side. Then send it away, and let it go. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And watch: if it goes up the road to its own territory, to Beth Shemesh, <i>then</i> He has done <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>us this great evil. But if not, then we shall know that <i>it is</i> not His hand <i>that</i> struck us&#8212;it happened to us by chance.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then the men did so; they took two milk cows and hitched them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And they set the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> on the cart, and the chest with the gold rats and the images of their tumors. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then the cows headed straight for the road to Beth Shemesh, <i>and</i> went along the highway, lowing as they went, and did not turn aside to the right hand or the left. And the lords of the Philistines went after them to the border of Beth Shemesh.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Now <i>the people of</i> Beth Shemesh <i>were</i> reaping their wheat harvest in the valley; and they lifted their eyes and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see <i>it.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then the cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh, and stood there; a large stone <i>was</i> there. So they split the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>The Levites took down the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and the chest that <i>was</i> with it, in which <i>were</i> the articles of gold, and put <i>them</i> on the large stone. Then the men of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings and made sacrifices the same day to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So when the five lords of the Philistines had seen <i>it,</i> they returned to Ekron the same day.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>These <i>are</i> the golden tumors which the Philistines returned <i>as</i> a trespass offering to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, one for Ekron; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>and the golden rats, <i>according to</i> the number of all the cities of the Philistines <i>belonging</i> to the five lords, <i>both</i> fortified cities and country villages, even as far as the large <i>stone of</i> Abel on which they set the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, <i>which stone remains</i> to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then He struck the men of Beth Shemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>He struck fifty thousand and seventy men of the people, and the people lamented because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had struck the people with a great slaughter.</span></p> <h3>
The Ark at Kirjath Jearim</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Sam-6-20"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And the men of Beth Shemesh said, &#8220;Who is able to stand before this holy <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God? And to whom shall it go up from us?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjath Jearim, saying, &#8220;The Philistines have brought back the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; come down <i>and</i> take it up with you.&#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-7336a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 6:4">1 Samuel 6:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>them</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7337b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 6:5">1 Samuel 6:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>ease</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7341c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 6:9">1 Samuel 6:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>this calamity to us</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7351d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 6:19">1 Samuel 6:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>He struck seventy men of the people and fifty oxen of a man</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
