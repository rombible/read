And the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was rare in those days; <i>there was</i> no widespread revelation. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And it came to pass at that time, while Eli <i>was</i> lying down in his place, and when his eyes had begun to grow so dim that he could not see, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and before the lamp of God went out in the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>tabernacle of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> where the ark of God <i>was,</i> and while Samuel was lying down, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> called Samuel. And he answered, &#8220;Here I am!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So he ran to Eli and said, &#8220;Here I am, for you called me.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-3-5">And he said, &#8220;I did not call; lie down again.&#8221; And he went and lay down.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> called yet again, &#8220;Samuel!&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-3-6">So Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, &#8220;Here I am, for you called me.&#8221; He answered, &#8220;I did not call, my son; lie down again.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>(Now Samuel did not yet know the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, nor was the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> yet revealed to him.)</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> called Samuel again the third time. So he arose and went to Eli, and said, &#8220;Here I am, for you did call me.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-3-8">Then Eli perceived that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had called the boy. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Therefore Eli said to Samuel, &#8220;Go, lie down; and it shall be, if He calls you, that you must say, &#8216;Speak, <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, for Your servant hears.&#8217; &#8221; So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Now the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came and stood and called as at other times, &#8220;Samuel! Samuel!&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-3-10">And Samuel answered, &#8220;Speak, for Your servant hears.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Samuel: &#8220;Behold, I will do something in Israel at which both ears of everyone who hears it will tingle. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from beginning to end. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For I have told him that I will judge his house forever for the iniquity which he knows, because his sons made themselves vile, and he did not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>restrain them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli&#8217;s house shall not be atoned for by sacrifice or offering forever.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So Samuel lay down until <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>morning, and opened the doors of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. And Samuel was afraid to tell Eli the vision. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then Eli called Samuel and said, &#8220;Samuel, my son!&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-3-16">He answered, &#8220;Here I am.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;What <i>is</i> the word that <i>the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span></i> spoke to you? Please do not hide <i>it</i> from me. God do so to you, and more also, if you hide anything from me of all the things that He said to you.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then Samuel told him everything, and hid nothing from him. And he said, &#8220;It <i>is</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. Let Him do what seems good to Him.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>So Samuel grew, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was with him and let none of his words <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>fall to the ground. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And all Israel from Dan to Beersheba knew that Samuel <i>had been</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>established as a prophet of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> appeared again in Shiloh.
