<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So Jonathan told David, saying, &#8220;My father Saul seeks to kill you. Therefore please be on your guard until morning, and stay in a secret <i>place</i> and hide. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you <i>are,</i> and I will speak with my father about you. Then what I observe, I will tell you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Thus Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father, and said to him, &#8220;Let not the king sin against his servant, against David, because he has not sinned against you, and because his works <i>have been</i> very good toward you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For he took his life in his hands and killed the Philistine, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> brought about a great deliverance for all Israel. You saw <i>it</i> and rejoiced. Why then will you sin against innocent blood, to kill David without a cause?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So Saul heeded the voice of Jonathan, and Saul swore, &#8220;<i>As</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> lives, he shall not be killed.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then Jonathan called David, and Jonathan told him all these things. So Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence as in times past.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And there was war again; and David went out and fought with the Philistines, and struck them with a mighty blow, and they fled from him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Now the distressing spirit from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came upon Saul as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand. And David was playing <i>music</i> with <i>his</i> hand. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then Saul sought to pin David to the wall with the spear, but he slipped away from Saul&#8217;s presence; and he drove the spear into the wall. So David fled and escaped that night.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Saul also sent messengers to David&#8217;s house to watch him and to kill him in the morning. And Michal, David&#8217;s wife, told him, saying, &#8220;If you do not save your life tonight, tomorrow you will be killed.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So Michal let David down through a window. And he went and fled and escaped. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And Michal took <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>an image and laid <i>it</i> in the bed, put a cover of goats&#8217; <i>hair</i> for his head, and covered <i>it</i> with clothes. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, &#8220;He <i>is</i> sick.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then Saul sent the messengers <i>back</i> to see David, saying, &#8220;Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may kill him.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And when the messengers had come in, there was the image in the bed, with a cover of goats&#8217; <i>hair</i> for his head. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then Saul said to Michal, &#8220;Why have you deceived me like this, and sent my enemy away, so that he has escaped?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-19-17">And Michal answered Saul, &#8220;He said to me, &#8216;Let me go! Why should I kill you?&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>So David fled and escaped, and went to Samuel at Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and stayed in Naioth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Now it was told Saul, saying, &#8220;Take note, David <i>is</i> at Naioth in Ramah!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then Saul sent messengers to take David. And when they saw the group of prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing <i>as</i> leader over them, the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And when Saul was told, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. Then Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then he also went to Ramah, and came to the great well that <i>is</i> at Sechu. So he asked, and said, &#8220;Where <i>are</i> Samuel and David?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-19-22">And <i>someone</i> said, &#8220;Indeed <i>they are</i> at Naioth in Ramah.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>So he went there to Naioth in Ramah. Then the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on and prophesied until he came to Naioth in Ramah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And he also stripped off his clothes and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Therefore they say, &#8220;<i>Is</i> Saul also among the prophets?&#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-7720a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 19:13">1 Samuel 19:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>household idols,</i> Heb. <i>teraphim</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
