Fill your horn with oil, and go; I am sending you to Jesse the Bethlehemite. For I have <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>provided Myself a king among his sons.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Samuel said, &#8220;How can I go? If Saul hears <i>it,</i> he will kill me.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-16-2">But the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said, &#8220;Take a heifer with you, and say, &#8216;I have come to sacrifice to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do; you shall anoint for Me the one I name to you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So Samuel did what the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said, and went to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, &#8220;Do you come peaceably?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. Sanctify<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span> yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice.&#8221; Then he consecrated Jesse and his sons, and invited them to the sacrifice.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So it was, when they came, that he looked at Eliab and said, &#8220;Surely the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s anointed <i>is</i> before Him!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to Samuel, &#8220;Do not look at his appearance or at his physical stature, because I have <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>refused him. For<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span> <i>the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> does</i> not <i>see</i> as man sees; for man looks at the outward appearance, but the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> looks at the heart.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, &#8220;Neither has the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> chosen this one.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then Jesse made Shammah pass by. And he said, &#8220;Neither has the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> chosen this one.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Thus Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, &#8220;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has not chosen these.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And Samuel said to Jesse, &#8220;Are all the young men here?&#8221; Then he said, &#8220;There remains yet the youngest, and there he is, keeping the sheep.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-16-11">And Samuel said to Jesse, &#8220;Send and bring him. For we will not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>sit down till he comes here.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So he sent and brought him in. Now he <i>was</i> ruddy, with <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>bright eyes, and good-looking. And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said, &#8220;Arise, anoint him; for this <i>is</i> the one!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers; and the Spirit of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel arose and went to Ramah.</span></p> <h3>
A Distressing Spirit Troubles Saul</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Sam-16-14"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But the Spirit of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> departed from Saul, and a distressing spirit from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> troubled him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And Saul&#8217;s servants said to him, &#8220;Surely, a distressing spirit from God is troubling you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Let our master now command your servants, <i>who are</i> before you, to seek out a man <i>who is</i> a skillful player on the harp. And it shall be that he will play it with his hand when the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>distressing spirit from God is upon you, and you shall be well.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So Saul said to his servants, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>&#8220;Provide me now a man who can play well, and bring <i>him</i> to me.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then one of the servants answered and said, &#8220;Look, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, <i>who is</i> skillful in playing, a mighty man of valor, a man of war, prudent in speech, and a handsome person; and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>is</i> with him.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, &#8220;Send me your son David, who <i>is</i> with the sheep.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And Jesse took a donkey <i>loaded with</i> bread, a skin of wine, and a young goat, and sent <i>them</i> by his son David to Saul. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>So David came to Saul and stood before him. And he loved him greatly, and he became his armorbearer. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then Saul sent to Jesse, saying, &#8220;Please let David stand before me, for he has found favor in my sight.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And so it was, whenever the spirit from God was upon Saul, that David would take a harp and play <i>it</i> with his hand. Then Saul would become refreshed and well, and the distressing spirit would depart from him.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-7597a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 16:1">1 Samuel 16:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>seen</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7601b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 16:5">1 Samuel 16:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Consecrate</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7603c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 16:7">1 Samuel 16:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>rejected</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7603d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 16:7">1 Samuel 16:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'>LXX <i>For God does not see as man sees;</i> Tg. <i>It is not by the appearance of a man;</i> Vg. <i>Nor do I judge according to the looks of a man</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7607e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 16:11">1 Samuel 16:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>So with LXX, Vg.; MT <i>turn around;</i> Tg., Syr. <i>turn away</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7608f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 16:12">1 Samuel 16:12</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>beautiful</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7612g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 16:16">1 Samuel 16:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>evil</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7613h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 16:17">1 Samuel 16:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Look now for a man for me</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
