<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Saul chose for himself three thousand <i>men</i> of Israel. Two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in the mountains of Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin. The rest of the people he sent away, every man to his tent.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And Jonathan attacked the garrison of the Philistines that <i>was</i> in Geba, and the Philistines heard <i>of it.</i> Then Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, &#8220;Let the Hebrews hear!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Now all Israel heard it said <i>that</i> Saul had attacked a garrison of the Philistines, and <i>that</i> Israel had also become <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>an abomination to the Philistines. And the people were called together to Saul at Gilgal.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then the Philistines gathered together to fight with Israel, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which <i>is</i> on the seashore in multitude. And they came up and encamped in Michmash, to the east of Beth Aven. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>When the men of Israel saw that they were in danger (for the people were distressed), then the people hid in caves, in thickets, in rocks, in holes, and in pits. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And <i>some of</i> the Hebrews crossed over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead.</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-13-7">As for Saul, he <i>was</i> still in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then he waited seven days, according to the time set by Samuel. But Samuel did not come to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So Saul said, &#8220;Bring a burnt offering and peace offerings here to me.&#8221; And he offered the burnt offering. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Now it happened, as soon as he had finished presenting the burnt offering, that Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>greet him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And Samuel said, &#8220;What have you done?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-13-11">Saul said, &#8220;When I saw that the people were scattered from me, and <i>that</i> you did not come within the days appointed, and <i>that</i> the Philistines gathered together at Michmash, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>then I said, &#8216;The Philistines will now come down on me at Gilgal, and I have not made supplication to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8217; Therefore I felt compelled, and offered a burnt offering.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And Samuel said to Saul, &#8220;You have done foolishly. You have not kept the commandment of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God, which He commanded you. For now the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> would have established your kingdom over Israel forever. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But now your kingdom shall not continue. The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has sought for Himself a man after His own heart, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has commanded him <i>to be</i> commander over His people, because you have not kept what the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> commanded you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then Samuel arose and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people present with him, about six hundred men.</span></p> <h3>
No Weapons for the Army</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Sam-13-16"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Saul, Jonathan his son, and the people present with them remained in <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>Gibeah of Benjamin. But the Philistines encamped in Michmash. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then raiders came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies. One company turned onto the road to Ophrah, to the land of Shual, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>another company turned to the road <i>to</i> Beth Horon, and another company turned <i>to</i> the road of the border that overlooks the Valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Now there was no blacksmith to be found throughout all the land of Israel, for the Philistines said, &#8220;Lest the Hebrews make swords or spears.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>But all the Israelites would go down to the Philistines to sharpen each man&#8217;s plowshare, his mattock, his ax, and his sickle; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>and the charge for a sharpening was a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>pim for the plowshares, the mattocks, the forks, and the axes, and to set the points of the goads. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So it came about, on the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people who <i>were</i> with Saul and Jonathan. But they were found with Saul and Jonathan his son.</span></p> <p>
