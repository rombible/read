<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Saul was sitting in the outskirts of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which <i>is</i> in Migron. The people who <i>were</i> with him <i>were</i> about six hundred men. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Ahijah the son of Ahitub, Ichabod&#8217;s brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s priest in Shiloh, was wearing an ephod. But the people did not know that Jonathan had gone.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Between the passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines&#8217; garrison, <i>there was</i> a sharp rock on one side and a sharp rock on the other side. And the name of one <i>was</i> Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>The front of one faced northward opposite Michmash, and the other southward opposite Gibeah.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then Jonathan said to the young man who bore his armor, &#8220;Come, let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised; it may be that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will work for us. For nothing restrains the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> from saving by many or by few.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So his armorbearer said to him, &#8220;Do all that is in your heart. Go then; here I am with you, according to your heart.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then Jonathan said, &#8220;Very well, let us cross over to <i>these</i> men, and we will show ourselves to them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>If they say thus to us, &#8216;Wait until we come to you,&#8217; then we will stand still in our place and not go up to them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>But if they say thus, &#8216;Come up to us,&#8217; then we will go up. For the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has delivered them into our hand, and this <i>will be</i> a sign to us.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So both of them showed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines. And the Philistines said, &#8220;Look, the Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have hidden.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then the men of the garrison called to Jonathan and his armorbearer, and said, &#8220;Come up to us, and we will <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>show you something.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-14-12">Jonathan said to his armorbearer, &#8220;Come up after me, for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has delivered them into the hand of Israel.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And Jonathan climbed up on his hands and knees with his armorbearer after him; and they fell before Jonathan. And as he came after him, his armorbearer killed them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>That first slaughter which Jonathan and his armorbearer made was about twenty men within about <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>half an acre of land.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And there was <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people. The garrison and the raiders also trembled; and the earth quaked, so that it was a very great trembling. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Now the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked, and <i>there</i> was the multitude, melting away; and they went here and there. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then Saul said to the people who <i>were</i> with him, &#8220;Now call the roll and see who has gone from us.&#8221; And when they had called the roll, surprisingly, Jonathan and his armorbearer <i>were</i> not <i>there.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And Saul said to Ahijah, &#8220;Bring the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>ark of God here&#8221; (for at that time the ark of God was with the children of Israel). </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Now it happened, while Saul talked to the priest, that the noise which <i>was</i> in the camp of the Philistines continued to increase; so Saul said to the priest, &#8220;Withdraw your hand.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then Saul and all the people who <i>were</i> with him assembled, and they went to the battle; and indeed every man&#8217;s sword was against his neighbor, <i>and there was</i> very great confusion. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Moreover the Hebrews <i>who</i> were with the Philistines before that time, who went up with them into the camp <i>from the</i> surrounding <i>country,</i> they also joined the Israelites who <i>were</i> with Saul and Jonathan. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Likewise all the men of Israel who had hidden in the mountains of Ephraim, <i>when</i> they heard that the Philistines fled, they also followed hard after them in the battle. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> saved Israel that day, and the battle shifted to Beth Aven.</span></p> <h3>
Saul&#8217;s Rash Oath</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Sam-14-24"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And the men of Israel were distressed that day, for Saul had placed the people under oath, saying, &#8220;Cursed <i>is</i> the man who eats <i>any</i> food until evening, before I have taken vengeance on my enemies.&#8221; So none of the people tasted food. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Now all <i>the people</i> of the land came to a forest; and there was honey on the ground. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And when the people had come into the woods, there was the honey, dripping; but no one put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>But Jonathan had not heard his father charge the people with the oath; therefore he stretched out the end of the rod that <i>was</i> in his hand and dipped it in a honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>countenance brightened. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then one of the people said, &#8220;Your father strictly charged the people with an oath, saying, &#8216;Cursed <i>is</i> the man who eats food this day.&#8217; &#8221; And the people were faint.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>But Jonathan said, &#8220;My father has troubled the land. Look now, how my countenance has brightened because I tasted a little of this honey. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>How much better if the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found! For now would there not have been a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Now they had <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>driven back the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. So the people were very faint. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And the people rushed on the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>spoil, and took sheep, oxen, and calves, and slaughtered <i>them</i> on the ground; and the people ate <i>them</i> with the blood. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Then they told Saul, saying, &#8220;Look, the people are sinning against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> by eating with the blood!&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-14-33">So he said, &#8220;You have dealt treacherously; roll a large stone to me this day.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Then Saul said, &#8220;Disperse yourselves among the people, and say to them, &#8216;Bring me here every man&#8217;s ox and every man&#8217;s sheep, slaughter <i>them</i> here, and eat; and do not sin against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> by eating with the blood.&#8217; &#8221; So every one of the people brought his ox with him that night, and slaughtered <i>it</i> there. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Then Saul built an altar to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. This was the first altar that he built to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Now Saul said, &#8220;Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and plunder them until the morning light; and let us not leave a man of them.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-14-36">And they said, &#8220;Do whatever seems good to you.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-14-36">Then the priest said, &#8220;Let us draw near to God here.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>So Saul asked counsel of God, &#8220;Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will You deliver them into the hand of Israel?&#8221; But He did not answer him that day. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>And Saul said, &#8220;Come over here, all you chiefs of the people, and know and see what this sin was today. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>For <i>as</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> lives, who saves Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die.&#8221; But not a man among all the people answered him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>Then he said to all Israel, &#8220;You be on one side, and my son Jonathan and I will be on the other side.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-14-40">And the people said to Saul, &#8220;Do what seems good to you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>Therefore Saul said to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel, &#8220;Give<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span> a perfect <i>lot.</i>&#8221; So Saul and Jonathan were taken, but the people escaped. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>And Saul said, &#8220;Cast <i>lots</i> between my son Jonathan and me.&#8221; So Jonathan was taken. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>Then Saul said to Jonathan, &#8220;Tell me what you have done.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-14-43">And Jonathan told him, and said, &#8220;I only tasted a little honey with the end of the rod that <i>was</i> in my hand. So now I must die!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>Saul answered, &#8220;God do so and more also; for you shall surely die, Jonathan.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>But the people said to Saul, &#8220;Shall Jonathan die, who has accomplished this great deliverance in Israel? Certainly not! <i>As</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> lives, not one hair of his head shall fall to the ground, for he has worked with God this day.&#8221; So the people rescued Jonathan, and he did not die.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span>Then Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines, and the Philistines went to their own place.</span></p> <h3>
Saul&#8217;s Continuing Wars</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Sam-14-47"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-47.htm"><b>47</b></a></span>So Saul established his sovereignty over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, against the people of Ammon, against Edom, against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines. Wherever he turned, he <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>harassed <i>them.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-48.htm"><b>48</b></a></span>And he gathered an army and attacked<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span> the Amalekites, and delivered Israel from the hands of those who plundered them.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-49.htm"><b>49</b></a></span>The sons of Saul were Jonathan, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[l]</a></span>Jishui, and Malchishua. And the names of his two daughters <i>were these:</i> the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-50.htm"><b>50</b></a></span>The name of Saul&#8217;s wife <i>was</i> Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. And the name of the commander of his army <i>was</i> Abner the son of Ner, Saul&#8217;s uncle. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-51.htm"><b>51</b></a></span>Kish <i>was</i> the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner <i>was</i> the son of Abiel.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-52.htm"><b>52</b></a></span>Now there was fierce war with the Philistines all the days of Saul.
