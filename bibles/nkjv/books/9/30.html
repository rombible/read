<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and had taken captive the women and those who <i>were</i> there, from small to great; they did not kill anyone, but carried <i>them</i> away and went their way. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So David and his men came to the city, and there it was, burned with fire; and their wives, their sons, and their daughters had been taken captive. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then David and the people who <i>were</i> with him lifted up their voices and wept, until they had no more power to weep. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And David&#8217;s two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite, had been taken captive. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now David was greatly distressed, for the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>grieved, every man for his sons and his daughters. But David strengthened himself in the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> his God.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech&#8217;s son, &#8220;Please bring the ephod here to me.&#8221; And Abiathar brought the ephod to David. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So David inquired of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, saying, &#8220;Shall I pursue this troop? Shall I overtake them?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-30-8">And He answered him, &#8220;Pursue, for you shall surely overtake <i>them</i> and without fail recover <i>all.</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So David went, he and the six hundred men who <i>were</i> with him, and came to the Brook Besor, where those stayed who were left behind. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>But David pursued, he and four hundred men; for two hundred stayed <i>behind,</i> who were so weary that they could not cross the Brook Besor.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David; and they gave him bread and he ate, and they let him drink water. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs and two clusters of raisins. So when he had eaten, his strength came back to him; for he had eaten no bread nor drunk water for three days and three nights. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then David said to him, &#8220;To whom do you <i>belong,</i> and where <i>are</i> you from?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-30-13">And he said, &#8220;I <i>am</i> a young man from Egypt, servant of an Amalekite; and my master left me behind, because three days ago I fell sick. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>We made an invasion of the southern <i>area</i> of the Cherethites, in the <i>territory</i> which <i>belongs</i> to Judah, and of the southern <i>area</i> of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And David said to him, &#8220;Can you take me down to this troop?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-30-15">So he said, &#8220;Swear to me by God that you will neither kill me nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will take you down to this troop.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And when he had brought him down, there they were, spread out over all the land, eating and drinking and dancing, because of all the great spoil which they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then David attacked them from twilight until the evening of the next day. Not a man of them escaped, except four hundred young men who rode on camels and fled. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>So David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away, and David rescued his two wives. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And nothing of theirs was lacking, either small or great, sons or daughters, spoil or anything which they had taken from them; David recovered all. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then David took all the flocks and herds they had driven before those <i>other</i> livestock, and said, &#8220;This <i>is</i> David&#8217;s spoil.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Now David came to the two hundred men who had been so weary that they could not follow David, whom they also had made to stay at the Brook Besor. So they went out to meet David and to meet the people who <i>were</i> with him. And when David came near the people, he <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>greeted them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then all the wicked and worthless<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> men of those who went with David answered and said, &#8220;Because they did not go with us, we will not give them <i>any</i> of the spoil that we have recovered, except for every man&#8217;s wife and children, that they may lead <i>them</i> away and depart.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>But David said, &#8220;My brethren, you shall not do so with what the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has given us, who has preserved us and delivered into our hand the troop that came against us. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>For who will heed you in this matter? But as his part <i>is</i> who goes down to the battle, so <i>shall</i> his part <i>be</i> who stays by the supplies; they shall share alike.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>So it was, from that day forward; he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Now when David came to Ziklag, he sent <i>some</i> of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>spoil to the elders of Judah, to his friends, saying, &#8220;Here is a present for you from the spoil of the enemies of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8221;&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>to <i>those</i> who <i>were</i> in Bethel, <i>those</i> who <i>were</i> in Ramoth of the South, <i>those</i> who <i>were</i> in Jattir, </span>
