<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Saul took him that day, and would not let him go home to his father&#8217;s house anymore. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And Jonathan took off the robe that <i>was</i> on him and gave it to David, with his armor, even to his sword and his bow and his belt.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So David went out wherever Saul sent him, <i>and</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>behaved wisely. And Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of Saul&#8217;s servants. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now it had happened as they were coming <i>home,</i> when David was returning from the slaughter of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Philistine, that the women had come out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet King Saul, with tambourines, with joy, and with musical instruments. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So the women sang as they danced, and said:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text 1Sam-18-7">&#8220;Saul has slain his thousands,</span><br /><span class="text 1Sam-18-7">And David his ten thousands.&#8221;</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then Saul was very angry, and the saying displeased him; and he said, &#8220;They have ascribed to David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed <i>only</i> thousands. Now <i>what</i> more can he have but the kingdom?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So Saul <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>eyed David from that day forward.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And it happened on the next day that the distressing spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied inside the house. So David played <i>music</i> with his hand, as at other times; but <i>there was</i> a spear in Saul&#8217;s hand. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And Saul cast the spear, for he said, &#8220;I will pin David to the wall!&#8221; But David escaped his presence twice.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now Saul was afraid of David, because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was with him, but had departed from Saul. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Therefore Saul removed him from <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>his presence, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And David behaved wisely in all his ways, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>was</i> with him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Therefore, when Saul saw that he behaved very wisely, he was afraid of him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them.</span></p> <h3>
David Marries Michal</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Sam-18-17"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then Saul said to David, &#8220;Here is my older daughter Merab; I will give her to you as a wife. Only be valiant for me, and fight the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s battles.&#8221; For Saul thought, &#8220;Let my hand not be against him, but let the hand of the Philistines be against him.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>So David said to Saul, &#8220;Who <i>am</i> I, and what <i>is</i> my life <i>or</i> my father&#8217;s family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>But it happened at the time when Merab, Saul&#8217;s daughter, should have been given to David, that she was given to Adriel the Meholathite as a wife.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Now Michal, Saul&#8217;s daughter, loved David. And they told Saul, and the thing pleased him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>So Saul said, &#8220;I will give her to him, that she may <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.&#8221; Therefore Saul said to David a second time, &#8220;You shall be my son-in-law today.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And Saul commanded his servants, &#8220;Communicate with David secretly, and say, &#8216;Look, the king has delight in you, and all his servants love you. Now therefore, become the king&#8217;s son-in-law.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>So Saul&#8217;s servants spoke those words in the hearing of David. And David said, &#8220;Does it seem to you <i>a</i> light <i>thing</i> to be a king&#8217;s son-in-law, seeing I <i>am</i> a poor and lightly esteemed man?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And the servants of Saul told him, saying, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>&#8220;In this manner David spoke.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then Saul said, &#8220;Thus you shall say to David: &#8216;The king does not desire any dowry but one hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to take vengeance on the king&#8217;s enemies.&#8217; &#8221; But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>So when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to become the king&#8217;s son-in-law. Now the days had not expired; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>therefore David arose and went, he and his men, and killed two hundred men of the Philistines. And David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full count to the king, that he might become the king&#8217;s son-in-law. Then Saul gave him Michal his daughter as a wife.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Thus Saul saw and knew that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>was</i> with David, and <i>that</i> Michal, Saul&#8217;s daughter, loved him; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>and Saul was still more afraid of David. So Saul became David&#8217;s enemy <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>continually. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Then the princes of the Philistines went out <i>to war.</i> And so it was, whenever they went out, <i>that</i> David behaved more wisely than all the servants of Saul, so that his name became highly esteemed.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-7678a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 18:1">1 Samuel 18:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>life of Jonathan was bound up with the life of</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7682b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 18:5">1 Samuel 18:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>prospered</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7683c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 18:6">1 Samuel 18:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Philistines</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7686d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 18:9">1 Samuel 18:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Viewed with suspicion</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7690e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 18:13">1 Samuel 18:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>himself</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7698f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 18:21">1 Samuel 18:21</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>be bait for</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7701g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 18:24">1 Samuel 18:24</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>According to these words</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7706h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 18:29">1 Samuel 18:29</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>all the days</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
