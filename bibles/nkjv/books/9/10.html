<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>When you have departed from me today, you will find two men by Rachel&#8217;s tomb in the territory of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say to you, &#8216;The donkeys which you went to look for have been found. And now your father has ceased caring about the donkeys and is worrying about you, saying, &#8220;What shall I do about my son?&#8221; &#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then you shall go on forward from there and come to the terebinth tree of Tabor. There three men going up to God at Bethel will meet you, one carrying three young goats, another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a skin of wine. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And they will <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>greet you and give you two <i>loaves</i> of bread, which you shall receive from their hands. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>After that you shall come to the hill of God where the Philistine garrison <i>is.</i> And it will happen, when you have come there to the city, that you will meet a group of prophets coming down from the high place with a stringed instrument, a tambourine, a flute, and a harp before them; and they will be prophesying. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then the Spirit of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will come upon you, and you will prophesy with them and be turned into another man. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And let it be, when these signs come to you, <i>that</i> you do as the occasion demands; for God <i>is</i> with you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>You shall go down before me to Gilgal; and surely I will come down to you to offer burnt offerings <i>and</i> make sacrifices of peace offerings. Seven days you shall wait, till I come to you and show you what you should do.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So it was, when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, that God <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>gave him another heart; and all those signs came to pass that day. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>When they came there to the hill, there was a group of prophets to meet him; then the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And it happened, when all who knew him formerly saw that he indeed prophesied among the prophets, that the people said to one another, &#8220;What <i>is</i> this <i>that</i> has come upon the son of Kish? <i>Is</i> Saul also among the prophets?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then a man from there answered and said, &#8220;But who <i>is</i> their father?&#8221; Therefore it became a proverb: &#8220;<i>Is</i> Saul also among the prophets?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And when he had finished prophesying, he went to the high place.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then Saul&#8217;s uncle said to him and his servant, &#8220;Where did you go?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-10-14">So he said, &#8220;To look for the donkeys. When we saw that <i>they were</i> nowhere <i>to be found,</i> we went to Samuel.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And Saul&#8217;s uncle said, &#8220;Tell me, please, what Samuel said to you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So Saul said to his uncle, &#8220;He told us plainly that the donkeys had been found.&#8221; But about the matter of the kingdom, he did not tell him what Samuel had said.</span></p> <h3>
Saul Proclaimed King</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Sam-10-17"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then Samuel called the people together to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> at Mizpah, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>and said to the children of Israel, &#8220;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel: &#8216;I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians <i>and</i> from the hand of all kingdoms and from those who oppressed you.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>But you have today rejected your God, who Himself saved you from all your adversities and your tribulations; and you have said to Him, &#8216;No, set a king over us!&#8217; Now therefore, present yourselves before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> by your tribes and by your <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>clans.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was chosen. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was chosen. And Saul the son of Kish was chosen. But when they sought him, he could not be found. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Therefore they inquired of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> further, &#8220;Has the man come here yet?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-10-22">And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> answered, &#8220;There he is, hidden among the equipment.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>So they ran and brought him from there; and when he stood among the people, he was taller than any of the people from his shoulders upward. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And Samuel said to all the people, &#8220;Do you see him whom the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has chosen, that <i>there is</i> no one like him among all the people?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-10-24">So all the people shouted and said, &#8220;Long<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span> live the king!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then Samuel explained to the people the behavior of royalty, and wrote <i>it</i> in a book and laid <i>it</i> up before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and valiant <i>men</i> went with him, whose hearts God had touched. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>But some rebels said, &#8220;How can this man save us?&#8221; So they despised him, and brought him no presents. But he <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>held his peace.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-7420a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 10:1">1 Samuel 10:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>So with MT, Tg., Vg.; LXX <i>people Israel; and you shall rule the people of the Lord;</i> LXX, Vg. add <i>And you shall deliver His people from the hands of their enemies all around them.
