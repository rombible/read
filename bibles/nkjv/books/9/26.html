<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then Saul arose and went down to the Wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the Wilderness of Ziph. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah, which <i>is</i> opposite Jeshimon, by the road. But David stayed in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul had indeed come.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So David arose and came to the place where Saul had encamped. And David saw the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the commander of his army. Now Saul lay within the camp, with the people encamped all around him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then David answered, and said to Ahimelech the Hittite and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother of Joab, saying, &#8220;Who will go down with me to Saul in the camp?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-26-6">And Abishai said, &#8220;I will go down with you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So David and Abishai came to the people by night; and there Saul lay sleeping within the camp, with his spear stuck in the ground by his head. And Abner and the people lay all around him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then Abishai said to David, &#8220;God has delivered your enemy into your hand this day. Now therefore, please, let me strike him <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>at once with the spear, right to the earth; and I will not <i>have to strike</i> him a second time!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But David said to Abishai, &#8220;Do not destroy him; for who can stretch out his hand against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s anointed, and be guiltless?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>David said furthermore, &#8220;<i>As</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> lives, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> shall strike him, or his day shall come to die, or he shall go out to battle and perish. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> forbid that I should stretch out my hand against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s anointed. But please, take now the spear and the jug of water that <i>are</i> by his head, and let us go.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So David took the spear and the jug of water <i>by</i> Saul&#8217;s head, and they got away; and no man saw or knew <i>it</i> or awoke. For they <i>were</i> all asleep, because a deep sleep from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had fallen on them.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Now David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of a hill afar off, a great distance <i>being</i> between them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And David called out to the people and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, &#8220;Do you not answer, Abner?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-26-14">Then Abner answered and said, &#8220;Who <i>are</i> you, calling out to the king?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So David said to Abner, &#8220;<i>Are</i> you not a man? And who <i>is</i> like you in Israel? Why then have you not guarded your lord the king? For one of the people came in to destroy your lord the king. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>This thing that you have done <i>is</i> not good. <i>As</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> lives, you deserve to die, because you have not guarded your master, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s anointed. And now see where the king&#8217;s spear <i>is,</i> and the jug of water that <i>was</i> by his head.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then Saul knew David&#8217;s voice, and said, &#8220;<i>Is</i> that your voice, my son David?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-26-17">David said, &#8220;<i>It is</i> my voice, my lord, O king.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;Why does my lord thus pursue his servant? For what have I done, or what evil <i>is</i> in my hand? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Now therefore, please, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant: If the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has stirred you up against me, let Him accept an offering. But if <i>it is</i> the children of men, <i>may</i> they <i>be</i> cursed before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, for they have driven me out this day from sharing in the inheritance of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, saying, &#8216;Go, serve other gods.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So now, do not let my blood fall to the earth before the face of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. For the king of Israel has come out to seek a flea, as when one hunts a partridge in the mountains.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then Saul said, &#8220;I have sinned. Return, my son David. For I will harm you no more, because my life was precious in your eyes this day. Indeed I have played the fool and erred exceedingly.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And David answered and said, &#8220;Here is the king&#8217;s spear. Let one of the young men come over and get it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>May the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> repay every man <i>for</i> his righteousness and his faithfulness; for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> delivered you into <i>my</i> hand today, but I would not stretch out my hand against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s anointed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And indeed, as your life was valued much this day in my eyes, so let my life be valued much in the eyes of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and let Him deliver me out of all tribulation.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then Saul said to David, &#8220;<i>May</i> you <i>be</i> blessed, my son David! You shall both do great things and also still prevail.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-26-25">So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-7914a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 26:8">1 Samuel 26:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>one time</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
