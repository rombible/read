And Ahimelech was afraid when he met David, and said to him, &#8220;Why <i>are</i> you alone, and no one is with you?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So David said to Ahimelech the priest, &#8220;The king has ordered me on some business, and said to me, &#8216;Do not let anyone know anything about the business on which I send you, or what I have commanded you.&#8217; And I have directed <i>my</i> young men to such and such a place. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Now therefore, what have you on hand? Give <i>me</i> five <i>loaves of</i> bread in my hand, or whatever can be found.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And the priest answered David and said, &#8220;<i>There is</i> no <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>common bread on hand; but there is holy<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span> bread, if the young men have at least kept themselves from women.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then David answered the priest, and said to him, &#8220;Truly, women <i>have been</i> kept from us about three days since I came out. And <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>the vessels of the young men are holy, and <i>the bread is</i> in effect common, even though it was consecrated in the vessel this day.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So the priest gave him holy <i>bread;</i> for there was no bread there but the showbread which had been taken from before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, in order to put hot bread <i>in its place</i> on the day when it was taken away.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now a certain man of the servants of Saul <i>was</i> there that day, detained before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. And his name <i>was</i> Doeg, an Edomite, the chief of the herdsmen who <i>belonged</i> to Saul.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And David said to Ahimelech, &#8220;Is there not here on hand a spear or a sword? For I have brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king&#8217;s business required haste.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So the priest said, &#8220;The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the Valley of Elah, there it is, wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you will take that, take <i>it.</i> For <i>there is</i> no other except that one here.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-21-9">And David said, &#8220;<i>There is</i> none like it; give it to me.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
David Flees to Gath</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Sam-21-10"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then David arose and fled that day from before Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And the servants of Achish said to him, &#8220;<i>Is</i> this not David the king of the land? Did they not sing of him to one another in dances, saying:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text 1Sam-21-11">&#8216;Saul has slain his thousands,</span><br /><span class="text 1Sam-21-11">And David his ten thousands&#8217;?&#8221;</span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now David took these words <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>to heart, and was very much afraid of Achish the king of Gath. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So he changed his behavior before them, pretended <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>madness in their hands, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>scratched on the doors of the gate, and let his saliva fall down on his beard. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then Achish said to his servants, &#8220;Look, you see the man is insane. Why have you brought him to me? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Have I need of madmen, that you have brought this <i>fellow</i> to play the madman in my presence?
