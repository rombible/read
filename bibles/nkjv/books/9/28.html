And Achish said to David, &#8220;You assuredly know that you will go out with me to battle, you and your men.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So David said to Achish, &#8220;Surely you know what your servant can do.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-28-2">And Achish said to David, &#8220;Therefore I will make you one of my chief guardians forever.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Saul Consults a Medium</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Sam-28-3"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Now Samuel had died, and all Israel had lamented for him and buried him in Ramah, in his own city. And Saul had put the mediums and the spiritists out of the land.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then the Philistines gathered together, and came and encamped at Shunem. So Saul gathered all Israel together, and they encamped at Gilboa. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>When Saul saw the army of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And when Saul inquired of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> did not answer him, either by dreams or by Urim or by the prophets.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then Saul said to his servants, &#8220;Find me a woman who is a medium, that I may go to her and inquire of her.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-28-7">And his servants said to him, &#8220;In fact, <i>there is</i> a woman who is a medium at En Dor.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So Saul disguised himself and put on other clothes, and he went, and two men with him; and they came to the woman by night. And he said, &#8220;Please conduct a s&#233;ance for me, and bring up for me the one I shall name to you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then the woman said to him, &#8220;Look, you know what Saul has done, how he has cut off the mediums and the spiritists from the land. Why then do you lay a snare for my life, to cause me to die?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And Saul swore to her by the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, saying, &#8220;<i>As</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> lives, no punishment shall come upon you for this thing.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then the woman said, &#8220;Whom shall I bring up for you?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-28-11">And he said, &#8220;Bring up Samuel for me.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud voice. And the woman spoke to Saul, saying, &#8220;Why have you deceived me? For you <i>are</i> Saul!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And the king said to her, &#8220;Do not be afraid. What did you see?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-28-13">And the woman said to Saul, &#8220;I saw a<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span> spirit ascending out of the earth.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So he said to her, &#8220;What <i>is</i> his form?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-28-14">And she said, &#8220;An old man is coming up, and he <i>is</i> covered with a mantle.&#8221; And Saul perceived that it <i>was</i> Samuel, and he stooped with <i>his</i> face to the ground and bowed down.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Now Samuel said to Saul, &#8220;Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-28-15">And Saul answered, &#8220;I am deeply distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God has departed from me and does not answer me anymore, neither by prophets nor by dreams. Therefore I have called you, that you may reveal to me what I should do.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then Samuel said: &#8220;So why do you ask me, seeing the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has departed from you and has become your enemy? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has done for <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>Himself as He spoke by me. For the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has torn the kingdom out of your hand and given it to your neighbor, David. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Because you did not obey the voice of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> nor execute His fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has done this thing to you this day. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Moreover the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will also deliver Israel with you into the hand of the Philistines. And tomorrow you and your sons <i>will be</i> with me. The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will also deliver the army of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Immediately Saul fell full length on the ground, and was dreadfully afraid because of the words of Samuel. And there was no strength in him, for he had eaten no food all day or all night.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And the woman came to Saul and saw that he was severely troubled, and said to him, &#8220;Look, your maidservant has obeyed your voice, and I have put my life in my hands and heeded the words which you spoke to me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Now therefore, please, heed also the voice of your maidservant, and let me set a piece of bread before you; and eat, that you may have strength when you go on <i>your</i> way.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>But he refused and said, &#8220;I will not eat.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-28-23">So his servants, together with the woman, urged him; and he heeded their voice. Then he arose from the ground and sat on the bed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Now the woman had a fatted calf in the house, and she hastened to kill it. And she took flour and kneaded <i>it,</i> and baked unleavened bread from it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>So she brought <i>it</i> before Saul and his servants, and they ate. Then they rose and went away that night.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-7956a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 28:13">1 Samuel 28:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. <i>elohim</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7960b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 28:17">1 Samuel 28:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>him,</i> i.e., David</span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
