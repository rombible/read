<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Therefore David inquired of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, saying, &#8220;Shall I go and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>attack these Philistines?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-23-2">And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to David, &#8220;Go and attack the Philistines, and save Keilah.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But David&#8217;s men said to him, &#8220;Look, we are afraid here in Judah. How much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then David inquired of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> once again.</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-23-4">And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> answered him and said, &#8220;Arise, go down to Keilah. For I will deliver the Philistines into your hand.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And David and his men went to Keilah and fought with the Philistines, struck them with a mighty blow, and took away their livestock. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now it happened, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David at Keilah, <i>that</i> he went down <i>with</i> an ephod in his hand.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And Saul was told that David had gone to Keilah. So Saul said, &#8220;God has delivered him into my hand, for he has shut himself in by entering a town that has gates and bars.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then Saul called all the people together for war, to go down to Keilah to besiege David and his men.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>When David knew that Saul plotted evil against him, he said to Abiathar the priest, &#8220;Bring the ephod here.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then David said, &#8220;O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel, Your servant has certainly heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah to destroy the city for my sake. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Will the men of Keilah deliver me into his hand? Will Saul come down, as Your servant has heard? O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel, I pray, tell Your servant.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-23-11">And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said, &#8220;He will come down.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then David said, &#8220;Will the men of Keilah <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-23-12">And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said, &#8220;They will deliver <i>you.</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So David and his men, about six hundred, arose and departed from Keilah and went wherever they could go. Then it was told Saul that David had escaped from Keilah; so he halted the expedition.</span></p> <h3>
David in Wilderness Strongholds</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Sam-23-14"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And David stayed in strongholds in the wilderness, and remained in the mountains in the Wilderness of Ziph. Saul sought him every day, but God did not deliver him into his hand. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life. And David <i>was</i> in the Wilderness of Ziph <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>in a forest. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then Jonathan, Saul&#8217;s son, arose and went to David in the woods and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>strengthened his hand in God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And he said to him, &#8220;Do not fear, for the hand of Saul my father shall not find you. You shall be king over Israel, and I shall be next to you. Even my father Saul knows that.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>So the two of them made a covenant before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. And David stayed in the woods, and Jonathan went to his own house.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then the Ziphites came up to Saul at Gibeah, saying, &#8220;Is David not hiding with us in strongholds in the woods, in the hill of Hachilah, which <i>is</i> on the south of Jeshimon? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of your soul to come down; and our part <i>shall be</i> to deliver him into the king&#8217;s hand.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And Saul said, &#8220;Blessed <i>are</i> you of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, for you have compassion on me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Please go and find out for sure, and see the place where his hideout is, <i>and</i> who has seen him there. For I am told he is very crafty. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hides; and come back to me with certainty, and I will go with you. And it shall be, if he is in the land, that I will search for him throughout all the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>clans of Judah.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>So they arose and went to Ziph before Saul. But David and his men <i>were</i> in the Wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>When Saul and his men went to seek <i>him,</i> they told David. Therefore he went down <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>to the rock, and stayed in the Wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard <i>that,</i> he pursued David in the Wilderness of Maon. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Then Saul went on one side of the mountain, and David and his men on the other side of the mountain. So David made haste to get away from Saul, for Saul and his men were encircling David and his men to take them.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>But a messenger came to Saul, saying, &#8220;Hurry and come, for the Philistines have invaded the land!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Therefore Saul returned from pursuing David, and went against the Philistines; so they called that place <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>the Rock of Escape. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Then David went up from there and dwelt in strongholds at En Gedi.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-7813a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 23:2">1 Samuel 23:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>strike</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7823b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 23:12">1 Samuel 23:12</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>shut up</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7826c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 23:15">1 Samuel 23:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>in Horesh</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7827d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 23:16">1 Samuel 23:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>encouraged him</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7834e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 23:23">1 Samuel 23:23</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>thousands</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7836f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 23:25">1 Samuel 23:25</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>from the rock</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7839g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 23:28">1 Samuel 23:28</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. <i>Sela Hammahlekoth</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
