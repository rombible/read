Samuel Judges Israel</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Sam-7-2"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So it was that the ark remained in Kirjath Jearim a long time; it was there twenty years. And all the house of Israel lamented after the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, &#8220;If you return to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> with all your hearts, <i>then</i> put away the foreign gods and the Ashtoreths<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span> from among you, and prepare your hearts for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and serve Him only; and He will deliver you from the hand of the Philistines.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So the children of Israel put away the Baals and the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>Ashtoreths, and served the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> only.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And Samuel said, &#8220;Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> for you.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So they gathered together at Mizpah, drew water, and poured <i>it</i> out before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. And they fasted that day, and said there, &#8220;We have sinned against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221; And Samuel judged the children of Israel at Mizpah.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel had gathered together at Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard <i>of it,</i> they were afraid of the Philistines. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So the children of Israel said to Samuel, &#8220;Do not cease to cry out to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God for us, that He may save us from the hand of the Philistines.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And Samuel took a suckling lamb and offered <i>it as</i> a whole burnt offering to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. Then Samuel cried out to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> for Israel, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> answered him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Now as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel. But the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> thundered with a loud thunder upon the Philistines that day, and so confused them that they were overcome before Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And the men of Israel went out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>drove them back as far as below Beth Car. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then Samuel took a stone and set <i>it</i> up between Mizpah and Shen, and called its name <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>Ebenezer, saying, &#8220;Thus far the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has helped us.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So the Philistines were subdued, and they did not come anymore into the territory of Israel. And the hand of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron to Gath; and Israel recovered its territory from the hands of the Philistines. Also there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>He went from year to year on a circuit to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah, and judged Israel in all those places. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But he always returned to Ramah, for his home <i>was</i> there. There he judged Israel, and there he built an altar to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-7356a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 7:3">1 Samuel 7:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Images of Canaanite goddesses</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7357b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 7:4">1 Samuel 7:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Images of Canaanite goddesses</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7364c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 7:11">1 Samuel 7:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>struck them down</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7365d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 7:12">1 Samuel 7:12</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Stone of Help</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
