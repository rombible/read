<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of Dagon<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span> and set it by Dagon. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And when the people of Ashdod arose early in the morning, there was Dagon, fallen on its face to the earth before the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. So they took Dagon and set it in its place again. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And when they arose early the next morning, there was Dagon, fallen on its face to the ground before the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. The head of Dagon and both the palms of its hands <i>were</i> broken off on the threshold; only <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>Dagon&#8217;s <i>torso</i> was left of it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Therefore neither the priests of Dagon nor any who come into Dagon&#8217;s house tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But the hand of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was heavy on the people of Ashdod, and He ravaged them and struck them with tumors,<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> <i>both</i> Ashdod and its territory. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And when the men of Ashdod saw how <i>it was,</i> they said, &#8220;The ark of the God of Israel must not remain with us, for His hand is harsh toward us and Dagon our god.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Therefore they sent and gathered to themselves all the lords of the Philistines, and said, &#8220;What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-5-8">And they answered, &#8220;Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried away to Gath.&#8221; So they carried the ark of the God of Israel away. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So it was, after they had carried it away, that the hand of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was against the city with a very great destruction; and He struck the men of the city, both small and great, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>and tumors broke out on them.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. So it was, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, &#8220;They have brought the ark of the God of Israel to us, to kill us and our people!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, &#8220;Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go back to its own place, so that it does not kill us and our people.&#8221; For there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there. </span>
