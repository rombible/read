<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And the priests&#8217; custom with the people <i>was that</i> when any man offered a sacrifice, the priest&#8217;s servant would come with a three-pronged fleshhook in his hand while the meat was boiling. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then he would thrust <i>it</i> into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; and the priest would take for himself all that the fleshhook brought up.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Also, before they burned the fat, the priest&#8217;s servant would come and say to the man who sacrificed, &#8220;Give meat for roasting to the priest, for he will not take boiled meat from you, but raw.&#8221;</span></p> <p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Moreover his mother used to make him a little robe, and bring <i>it</i> to him year by year when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, and say, &#8220;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> give you descendants from this woman for the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>loan that was given to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221; Then they would go to their own home.</span></p> <p>

Prophecy Against Eli&#8217;s Household</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Sam-2-22"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Now Eli was very old; and he heard everything his sons did to all Israel, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>and how they lay with the women who assembled at the door of the tabernacle of meeting. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>So he said to them, &#8220;Why do you do such things? For I hear of your evil dealings from all the people. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>No, my sons! For <i>it is</i> not a good report that I hear. You make the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s people transgress. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>If one man sins against another, God<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span> will judge him. But if a man sins against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, who will intercede for him?&#8221; Nevertheless they did not heed the voice of their father, because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> desired to kill them.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And the child Samuel grew in stature, and in favor both with the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and men.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Then a man of God came to Eli and said to him, &#8220;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8216;Did I not clearly reveal Myself to the house of your father when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh&#8217;s house? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Did I not choose him out of all the tribes of Israel <i>to be</i> My priest, to offer upon My altar, to burn incense, and to wear an ephod before Me?

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Why do you kick at My sacrifice and My offering which I have commanded <i>in My</i> dwelling place, and honor your sons more than Me, to make yourselves fat with the best of all the offerings of Israel My people?&#8217; </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Behold, the days are coming that I will cut off your <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span>arm and the arm of your father&#8217;s house, so that there will not be an old man in your house. </span>
