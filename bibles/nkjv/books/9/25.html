And David arose and went down to the Wilderness of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>Paran.</span></p> <h3>
David and the Wife of Nabal</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Sam-25-2"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Now <i>there was</i> a man in Maon whose business <i>was</i> in Carmel, and the man <i>was</i> very rich. He had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats. And he was shearing his sheep in Carmel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>The name of the man <i>was</i> Nabal, and the name of his wife Abigail. And <i>she was</i> a woman of good understanding and beautiful appearance; but the man <i>was</i> harsh and evil in <i>his</i> doings. He <i>was of the house of</i> Caleb.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>When David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>David sent ten young men; and David said to the young men, &#8220;Go up to Carmel, go to Nabal, and greet him in my name. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And thus you shall say to him who lives <i>in prosperity:</i> &#8216;Peace <i>be</i> to you, peace to your house, and peace to all that you have! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now I have heard that you have shearers. Your shepherds were with us, and we did not hurt them, nor was there anything missing from them all the while they were in Carmel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Ask your young men, and they will tell you. Therefore <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>let <i>my</i> young men find favor in your eyes, for we come on a feast day. Please give whatever comes to your hand to your servants and to your son David.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So when David&#8217;s young men came, they spoke to Nabal according to all these words in the name of David, and waited.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then Nabal answered David&#8217;s servants, and said, &#8220;Who <i>is</i> David, and who <i>is</i> the son of Jesse? There are many servants nowadays who break away each one from his master. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Shall I then take my bread and my water and my <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>meat that I have killed for my shearers, and give <i>it</i> to men when I do not know where they <i>are</i> from?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So David&#8217;s young men turned on their heels and went back; and they came and told him all these words. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then David said to his men, &#8220;Every man gird on his sword.&#8221; So every man girded on his sword, and David also girded on his sword. And about four hundred men went with David, and two hundred stayed with the supplies.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Now one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal&#8217;s wife, saying, &#8220;Look, David sent messengers from the wilderness to greet our master; and he <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>reviled them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But the men <i>were</i> very good to us, and we were not hurt, nor did we miss anything as long as we accompanied them, when we were in the fields. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>They were a wall to us both by night and day, all the time we were with them keeping the sheep. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Now therefore, know and consider what you will do, for harm is determined against our master and against all his household. For he <i>is such</i> a scoundrel<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span> that <i>one</i> cannot speak to him.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then Abigail made haste and took two hundred <i>loaves</i> of bread, two skins of wine, five sheep already dressed, five seahs of roasted <i>grain,</i> one hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and loaded <i>them</i> on donkeys. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And she said to her servants, &#8220;Go on before me; see, I am coming after you.&#8221; But she did not tell her husband Nabal.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So it was, <i>as</i> she rode on the donkey, that she went down under cover of the hill; and there were David and his men, coming down toward her, and she met them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Now David had said, &#8220;Surely in vain I have protected all that this <i>fellow</i> has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that <i>belongs</i> to him. And he has repaid me evil for good. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>May God do so, and more also, to the enemies of David, if I leave one male of all who <i>belong</i> to him by morning light.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Now when Abigail saw David, she dismounted quickly from the donkey, fell on her face before David, and bowed down to the ground. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>So she fell at his feet and said: &#8220;On me, my lord, <i>on</i> me <i>let</i> this iniquity <i>be!</i> And please let your maidservant <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>speak in your ears, and hear the words of your maidservant. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Please, let not my lord <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>regard this scoundrel Nabal. For as his name <i>is,</i> so <i>is</i> he: <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>Nabal <i>is</i> his name, and folly <i>is</i> with him! But I, your maidservant, did not see the young men of my lord whom you sent. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Now therefore, my lord, <i>as</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> lives and <i>as</i> your soul lives, since the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has held you back from coming to bloodshed and from avenging<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span> yourself with your own hand, now then, let your enemies and those who seek harm for my lord be as Nabal. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And now this present which your maidservant has brought to my lord, let it be given to the young men who follow my lord. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Please forgive the trespass of your maidservant. For the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will certainly make for my lord an enduring house, because my lord fights the battles of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and evil is not found in you throughout your days. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Yet a man has risen to pursue you and seek your life, but the life of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of the living with the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God; and the lives of your enemies He shall sling out, <i>as from</i> the pocket of a sling. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And it shall come to pass, when the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has done for my lord according to all the good that He has spoken concerning you, and has appointed you ruler over Israel, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>that this will be no grief to you, nor offense of heart to my lord, either that you have shed blood without cause, or that my lord has avenged himself. But when the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has dealt well with my lord, then remember your maidservant.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Then David said to Abigail: &#8220;Blessed <i>is</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And blessed <i>is</i> your advice and blessed <i>are</i> you, because you have kept me this day from coming to bloodshed and from avenging myself with my own hand. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>For indeed, <i>as</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel lives, who has kept me back from hurting you, unless you had hurried and come to meet me, surely by morning light no males would have been left to Nabal!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>So David received from her hand what she had brought him, and said to her, &#8220;Go up in peace to your house. See, I have heeded your voice and respected your person.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Now Abigail went to Nabal, and there he was, holding a feast in his house, like the feast of a king. And Nabal&#8217;s heart <i>was</i> merry within him, for he <i>was</i> very drunk; therefore she told him nothing, little or much, until morning light. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>So it was, in the morning, when the wine had gone from Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became <i>like</i> a stone. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>Then it happened, <i>after</i> about ten days, that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> struck Nabal, and he died.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>So when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, &#8220;Blessed <i>be</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, who has pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and has kept His servant from evil! For the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has returned the wickedness of Nabal on his own head.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-25-39">And David sent and proposed to Abigail, to take her as his wife. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>When the servants of David had come to Abigail at Carmel, they spoke to her saying, &#8220;David sent us to you, to ask you to become his wife.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>Then she arose, bowed her face to the earth, and said, &#8220;Here is your maidservant, a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>So Abigail rose in haste and rode on a donkey, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>attended by five of her maidens; and she followed the messengers of David, and became his wife. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel, and so both of them were his wives.</span></p> <p>
