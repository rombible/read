<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then the Philistines followed hard after Saul and his sons. And the Philistines killed Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua, Saul&#8217;s sons. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>The battle became fierce against Saul. The archers <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>hit him, and he was severely wounded by the archers.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then Saul said to his armorbearer, &#8220;Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised men come and thrust me through and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>abuse me.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-31-4">But his armorbearer would not, for he was greatly afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword and fell on it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And when his armorbearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his sword, and died with him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So Saul, his three sons, his armorbearer, and all his men died together that same day.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And when the men of Israel who <i>were</i> on the other side of the valley, and <i>those</i> who <i>were</i> on the other side of the Jordan, saw that the men of Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So it happened the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And they cut off his head and stripped off his armor, and sent <i>word</i> throughout the land of the Philistines, to proclaim <i>it in</i> the temple of their idols and among the people. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then they put his armor in the temple of the Ashtoreths, and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> Shan.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now when the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>all the valiant men arose and traveled all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth Shan; and they came to Jabesh and burned them there. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then they took their bones and buried <i>them</i> under the tamarisk tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-8013a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 31:3">1 Samuel 31:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>found him</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8014b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 31:4">1 Samuel 31:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>torture</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8020c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 31:10">1 Samuel 31:10</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Beth Shean,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Josh.17.11" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=Josh.17.11&amp;version=NKJV">Josh. 17:11</span></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
