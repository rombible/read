So when his brothers and all his father&#8217;s house heard <i>it,</i> they went down there to him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And everyone <i>who was</i> in distress, everyone who <i>was</i> in debt, and everyone <i>who was</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>discontented gathered to him. So he became captain over them. And there were about four hundred men with him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then David went from there to Mizpah of Moab; and he said to the king of Moab, &#8220;Please let my father and mother come here with you, till I know what God will do for me.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So he brought them before the king of Moab, and they dwelt with him all the time that David was in the stronghold.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now the prophet Gad said to David, &#8220;Do not stay in the stronghold; depart, and go to the land of Judah.&#8221; So David departed and went into the forest of Hereth.</span></p> <h3>
Saul Murders the Priests</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Sam-22-6"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>When Saul heard that David and the men who <i>were</i> with him had been discovered&#8212;now Saul was staying in Gibeah under a tamarisk tree in Ramah, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants standing about him&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>then Saul said to his servants who stood about him, &#8220;Hear now, you Benjamites! Will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, <i>and</i> make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>All of you have conspired against me, and <i>there is</i> no one who reveals to me that my son has made a covenant with the son of Jesse; and <i>there is</i> not one of you who is sorry for me or reveals to me that my son has stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as <i>it is</i> this day.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then answered Doeg the Edomite, who was set over the servants of Saul, and said, &#8220;I saw the son of Jesse going to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And he inquired of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> for him, gave him provisions, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father&#8217;s house, the priests who <i>were</i> in Nob. And they all came to the king. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And Saul said, &#8220;Hear now, son of Ahitub!&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-22-12">He answered, &#8220;Here I am, my lord.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then Saul said to him, &#8220;Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, in that you have given him bread and a sword, and have inquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as it is this day?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So Ahimelech answered the king and said, &#8220;And who among all your servants <i>is as</i> faithful as David, who is the king&#8217;s son-in-law, who goes at your bidding, and is honorable in your house? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Did I then begin to inquire of God for him? Far be it from me! Let not the king impute anything to his servant, <i>or</i> to any in the house of my father. For your servant knew nothing of all this, little or much.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And the king said, &#8220;You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you and all your father&#8217;s house!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then the king said to the guards who stood about him, &#8220;Turn and kill the priests of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, because their hand also <i>is</i> with David, and because they knew when he fled and did not tell it to me.&#8221; But the servants of the king would not lift their hands to strike the priests of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And the king said to Doeg, &#8220;You turn and kill the priests!&#8221; So Doeg the Edomite turned and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>struck the priests, and killed on that day eighty-five men who wore a linen ephod. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Also Nob, the city of the priests, he struck with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and nursing infants, oxen and donkeys and sheep&#8212;with the edge of the sword.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Now one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped and fled after David. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And Abiathar told David that Saul had killed the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s priests. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So David said to Abiathar, &#8220;I knew that day, when Doeg the Edomite <i>was</i> there, that he would surely tell Saul. I have caused <i>the death</i> of all the persons of your father&#8217;s <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>house. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Stay with me; do not fear.
