So I shall escape out of his hand.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then David arose and went over with the six hundred men who <i>were</i> with him to Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, each man with his household, <i>and</i> David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal&#8217;s widow. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And it was told Saul that David had fled to Gath; so he sought him no more.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then David said to Achish, &#8220;If I have now found favor in your eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may dwell there. For why should your servant dwell in the royal city with you?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So Achish gave him Ziklag that day. Therefore Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah to this day. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was one full year and four months.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites, the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Girzites, and the Amalekites. For those <i>nations</i> were the inhabitants of the land from <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>of old, as you go to Shur, even as far as the land of Egypt. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Whenever David <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>attacked the land, he left neither man nor woman alive, but took away the sheep, the oxen, the donkeys, the camels, and the apparel, and returned and came to Achish. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then Achish would say, &#8220;Where have you made a raid today?&#8221; And David would say, &#8220;Against the southern <i>area</i> of Judah, or against the southern <i>area</i> of the Jerahmeelites, or against the southern <i>area</i> of the Kenites.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>David would save neither man nor woman alive, to bring <i>news</i> to Gath, saying, &#8220;Lest they should inform on us, saying, &#8216;Thus David did.&#8217; &#8221; And thus <i>was</i> his behavior all the time he dwelt in the country of the Philistines. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So Achish believed David, saying, &#8220;He has made his people Israel utterly abhor him; therefore he will be my servant forever.&#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-7932a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 27:1">1 Samuel 27:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>despair of searching for</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7938b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 27:7">1 Samuel 27:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>the number of days</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7939c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 27:8">1 Samuel 27:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>Gezrites</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7939d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 27:8">1 Samuel 27:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>ancient times</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-7940e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Samuel 27:9">1 Samuel 27:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>struck</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
