<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and sent Timothy, our brother and minister of God, and our fellow laborer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you and encourage you concerning your faith, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>that no one should be shaken by these afflictions; for you yourselves know that we are appointed to this. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For, in fact, we told you before when we were with you that we would suffer tribulation, just as it happened, and you know. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For this reason, when I could no longer endure it, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter had tempted you, and our labor might be in vain.</span></p> <h3>
Encouraged by Timothy</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Thess-3-6"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But now that Timothy has come to us from you, and brought us good news of your faith and love, and that you always have good remembrance of us, greatly desiring to see us, as we also <i>to see</i> you&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>therefore, brethren, in all our affliction and distress we were comforted concerning you by your faith. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For now we live, if you stand fast in the Lord.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For what thanks can we render to God for you, for all the joy with which we rejoice for your sake before our God, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your face and perfect what is lacking in your faith?</span></p> <h3>
Prayer for the Church</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Thess-3-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now may our God and Father Himself, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way to you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And may the Lord make you increase and abound in love to one another and to all, just as we <i>do</i> to you, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>so that He may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all His saints.</span></p> </div></div></body></html>
