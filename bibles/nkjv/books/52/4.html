<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>for you know what commandments we gave you through the Lord Jesus.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you should abstain from sexual immorality; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>that each of you should know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honor, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>not in passion of lust, like the Gentiles who do not know God; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>that no one should take advantage of and defraud his brother in this matter, because the Lord <i>is</i> the avenger of all such, as we also forewarned you and testified. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For God did not call us to uncleanness, but in holiness. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Therefore he who rejects <i>this</i> does not reject man, but God, who<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span> has also given us His Holy Spirit.</span></p> <h3>
A Brotherly and Orderly Life</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Thess-4-9"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But concerning brotherly love you have no need that I should write to you, for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and indeed you do so toward all the brethren who are in all Macedonia. But we urge you, brethren, that you increase more and more; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>that you also aspire to lead a quiet life, to mind your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>that you may walk properly toward those who are outside, and <i>that</i> you may lack nothing.</span></p> <h3>
The Comfort of Christ&#8217;s Coming</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Thess-4-13"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>But I do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning those who have fallen <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>asleep, lest you sorrow as others who have no hope. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Him those who <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>sleep in Jesus.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive <i>and</i> remain until the coming of the Lord will by no means precede those who are <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>asleep. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then we who are alive <i>and</i> remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Therefore comfort one another with these words.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-29612a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Thessalonians 4:8">1 Thessalonians 4:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>who also gives</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29617b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Thessalonians 4:13">1 Thessalonians 4:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Died</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29618c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Thessalonians 4:14">1 Thessalonians 4:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>through Jesus sleep</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29619d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Thessalonians 4:15">1 Thessalonians 4:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Dead</span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
