<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>But <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>even after we had suffered before and were spitefully treated at Philippi, as you know, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God in much conflict. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For our exhortation <i>did</i> not <i>come</i> from error or uncleanness, nor <i>was it</i> in deceit.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, even so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God who tests our hearts. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For neither at any time did we use flattering words, as you know, nor a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>cloak for covetousness&#8212;God <i>is</i> witness. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Nor did we seek glory from men, either from you or from others, when we might have made demands as apostles of Christ. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But we were gentle among you, just as a nursing <i>mother</i> cherishes her own children. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So, affectionately longing for you, we were well pleased to impart to you not only the gospel of God, but also our own lives, because you had become dear to us. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For you remember, brethren, our labor and toil; for laboring night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you, we preached to you the gospel of God.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>You <i>are</i> witnesses, and God <i>also,</i> how devoutly and justly and blamelessly we behaved ourselves among you who believe; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>as you know how we exhorted, and comforted, and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>charged every one of you, as a father <i>does</i> his own children, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>that you would walk worthy of God who calls you into His own kingdom and glory.</span></p> <h3>
Their Conversion</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Thess-2-13"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For this reason we also thank God without ceasing, because when you received the word of God which you heard from us, you welcomed <i>it</i> not <i>as</i> the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which also effectively works in you who believe. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For you, brethren, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus. For you also suffered the same things from your own countrymen, just as they <i>did</i> from the Judeans, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>who killed both the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they do not please God and are <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>contrary to all men, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved, so as always to fill up <i>the measure of</i> their sins; but wrath has come upon them to the uttermost.</span></p> <h3>
Longing to See Them</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Thess-2-17"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But we, brethren, having been taken away from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavored more eagerly to see your face with great desire. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Therefore we wanted to come to you&#8212;even I, Paul, time and again&#8212;but Satan hindered us. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>For what <i>is</i> our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? <i>Is it</i> not even you in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at His coming? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>For you are our glory and joy.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-29573a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Thessalonians 2:2">1 Thessalonians 2:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M omit <i>even</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29576b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Thessalonians 2:5">1 Thessalonians 2:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>pretext for greed</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29582c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Thessalonians 2:11">1 Thessalonians 2:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M <i>implored</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29586d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Thessalonians 2:15">1 Thessalonians 2:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>hostile</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
