<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_john/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>because of the truth which abides in us and will be with us forever:</span></p> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_john/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Grace, mercy, <i>and</i> peace will be with <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>you from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</span></p> <h3>
Walk in Christ&#8217;s Commandments</span></h3><p><span class="text 2John-1-4"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_john/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>I rejoiced greatly that I have found <i>some</i> of your children walking in truth, as we received commandment from the Father. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_john/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And now I plead with you, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment to you, but that which we have had from the beginning: that we love one another. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_john/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>This is love, that we walk according to His commandments. This is the commandment, that as you have heard from the beginning, you should walk in it.</span></p> <h3>
Beware of Antichrist Deceivers</span></h3><p><span class="text 2John-1-7"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_john/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For many deceivers have gone out into the world who do not confess Jesus Christ <i>as</i> coming in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_john/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Look to yourselves, that <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>we do not lose those things we worked for, but <i>that</i> we may receive a full reward.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_john/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Whoever <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>transgresses and does not abide in the doctrine of Christ does not have God. He who abides in the doctrine of Christ has both the Father and the Son. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_john/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>If anyone comes to you and does not bring this doctrine, do not receive him into your house nor greet him; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_john/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>for he who greets him shares in his evil deeds.</span></p> <h3>
