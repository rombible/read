Solomon&#8217;s Speech upon Completion of the Work</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Chr-6-3"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then the king turned around and blessed the whole assembly of Israel, while all the assembly of Israel was standing. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And he said: &#8220;Blessed <i>be</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel, who has fulfilled with His hands <i>what</i> He spoke with His mouth to my father David, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8216;Since the day that I brought My people out of the land of Egypt, I have chosen no city from any tribe of Israel <i>in which</i> to build a house, that My name might be there, nor did I choose any man to be a ruler over My people Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Yet I have chosen Jerusalem, that My name may be there, and I have chosen David to be over My people Israel.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now it was in the heart of my father David to build a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>temple for the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to my father David, &#8216;Whereas it was in your heart to build a temple for My name, you did well in that it was in your heart. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Nevertheless you shall not build the temple, but your son who will come from your body, he shall build the temple for My name.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has fulfilled His word which He spoke, and I have filled the position of my father David, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> promised; and I have built the temple for the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And there I have put the ark, in which <i>is</i> the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> which He made with the children of Israel.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>(for Solomon had made a bronze platform five cubits long, five cubits wide, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court; and he stood on it, knelt down on his knees before all the assembly of Israel, and spread out his hands toward heaven); </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>and he said: &#8220;<span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel, <i>there is</i> no God in heaven or on earth like You, who keep <i>Your</i> covenant and mercy with Your servants who walk before You with all their hearts. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>You have kept what You promised Your servant David my father; You have both spoken with Your mouth and fulfilled <i>it</i> with Your hand, as <i>it is</i> this day. </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And now, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel, let Your word come true, which You have spoken to Your servant David.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>&#8220;But will God indeed dwell with men on the earth?

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Yet regard the prayer of Your servant and his supplication, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> my God, and listen to the cry and the prayer which Your servant is praying before You: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>that Your eyes may be open toward this temple day and night, toward the place where <i>You</i> said <i>You would</i> put Your name, that You may hear the prayer which Your servant makes toward this place. </span>
