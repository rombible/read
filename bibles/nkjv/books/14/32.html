<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come, and that his purpose was to make war against Jerusalem, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>he consulted with his leaders and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>commanders to stop the water from the springs which <i>were</i> outside the city; and they helped him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Thus many people gathered together who stopped all the springs and the brook that ran through the land, saying, &#8220;Why should the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>kings of Assyria come and find much water?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And he strengthened himself, built up all the wall that was broken, raised <i>it</i> up to the towers, and <i>built</i> another wall outside; also he repaired <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>the Millo <i>in</i> the City of David, and made <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>weapons and shields in abundance. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then he set military captains over the people, gathered them together to him in the open square of the city gate, and gave them encouragement, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8220;Be strong and courageous; do not be afraid nor dismayed before the king of Assyria, nor before all the multitude that <i>is</i> with him; for <i>there are</i> more with us than with him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>With him <i>is</i> an arm of flesh; but with us <i>is</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God, to help us and to fight our battles.&#8221; And the people were strengthened by the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>After this Sennacherib king of Assyria sent his servants to Jerusalem (but he and all the forces with him <i>laid siege</i> against Lachish), to Hezekiah king of Judah, and to all Judah who <i>were</i> in Jerusalem, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8220;Thus says Sennacherib king of Assyria: &#8216;In what do you trust, that you remain under siege in Jerusalem? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Does not Hezekiah persuade you to give yourselves over to die by famine and by thirst, saying, &#8220;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God will deliver us from the hand of the king of Assyria&#8221;? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Has not the same Hezekiah taken away His high places and His altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, &#8220;You shall worship before one altar and burn incense on it&#8221;? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of <i>other</i> lands? Were the gods of the nations of those lands in any way able to deliver their lands out of my hand? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Who <i>was there</i> among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed that could deliver his people from my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you from my hand? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Now therefore, do not let Hezekiah deceive you or persuade you like this, and do not believe him; for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people from my hand or the hand of my fathers. How much less will your God deliver you from my hand?&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Furthermore, his servants spoke against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God and against His servant Hezekiah.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>He also wrote letters to revile the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel, and to speak against Him, saying, &#8220;As the gods of the nations of <i>other</i> lands have not delivered their people from my hand, so the God of Hezekiah will not deliver His people from my hand.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then they called out with a loud voice in <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>Hebrew to the people of Jerusalem who <i>were</i> on the wall, to frighten them and trouble them, that they might take the city. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And they spoke against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth&#8212;the work of men&#8217;s hands.</span></p> <h3>
Sennacherib&#8217;s Defeat and Death</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Chr-32-20"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Now because of this King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah, the son of Amoz, prayed and cried out to heaven. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> sent an angel who cut down every mighty man of valor, leader, and captain in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned shamefaced to his own land. And when he had gone into the temple of his god, some of his own offspring struck him down with the sword there.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Thus the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all <i>others,</i> and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>guided them on every side. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And many brought gifts to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> at Jerusalem, and presents<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span> to Hezekiah king of Judah, so that he was exalted in the sight of all nations thereafter.</span></p> <h3>
Hezekiah Humbles Himself</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Chr-32-24"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>In those days Hezekiah was sick and near death, and he prayed to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; and He spoke to him and gave him a sign. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>But Hezekiah did not repay according to the favor <i>shown</i> him, for his heart was lifted up; therefore wrath was looming over him and over Judah and Jerusalem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Then Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> did not come upon them in the days of Hezekiah.</span></p> <h3>
Hezekiah&#8217;s Wealth and Honor</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Chr-32-27"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Hezekiah had very great riches and honor. And he made himself treasuries for silver, for gold, for precious stones, for spices, for shields, and for all kinds of desirable items; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>storehouses for the harvest of grain, wine, and oil; and stalls for all kinds of livestock, and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>folds for flocks. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Moreover he provided cities for himself, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance; for God had given him very much property. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>This same Hezekiah also stopped the water outlet of Upper Gihon, and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>brought the water by tunnel to the west side of the City of David. Hezekiah prospered in all his works.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>However, <i>regarding</i> the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, whom they sent to him to inquire about the wonder that was <i>done</i> in the land, God withdrew from him, in order to test him, that He might know all <i>that was</i> in his heart.</span></p> <h3>
Death of Hezekiah</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Chr-32-32"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, indeed they <i>are</i> written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, <i>and</i> in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>So Hezekiah <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>rested with his fathers, and they buried him in the upper tombs of the sons of David; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem honored him at his death. Then Manasseh his son reigned in his place.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-11879a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 32:3">2 Chronicles 32:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>mighty men</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11880b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 32:4">2 Chronicles 32:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'>So with MT, Vg.; Arab., LXX, Syr. <i>king</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11881c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 32:5">2 Chronicles 32:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>The Landfill</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11881d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 32:5">2 Chronicles 32:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>javelins</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11894e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 32:18">2 Chronicles 32:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Judean</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11898f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 32:22">2 Chronicles 32:22</span> <span class='footnote-text'>LXX <i>gave them rest;</i> Vg. <i>gave them treasures</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11899g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 32:23">2 Chronicles 32:23</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>precious things</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11904h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 32:28">2 Chronicles 32:28</span> <span class='footnote-text'>So with LXX, Vg.; Arab., Syr. omit <i>folds for flocks;</i> MT <i>flocks for sheepfolds</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11906i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 32:30">2 Chronicles 32:30</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>brought it straight to</i> (cf. <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Kgs.20.20" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Kgs.20.20&amp;version=NKJV">2 Kin. 20:20</span>)</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11909j"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 32:33">2 Chronicles 32:33</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Died and joined his ancestors</span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
