<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made molded images for the Baals. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>He burned incense in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, and burned his children in the fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had cast out before the children of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And he sacrificed and burned incense on the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>high places, on the hills, and under every green tree.</span></p> <h3>
Syria and Israel Defeat Judah</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Chr-28-5"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Therefore the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria. They defeated him, and carried away a great multitude of them as captives, and brought <i>them</i> to Damascus. Then he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who defeated him with a great slaughter. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>For Pekah the son of Remaliah killed one hundred and twenty thousand in Judah in one day, all valiant men, because they had forsaken the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of their fathers. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the king&#8217;s son, Azrikam the officer over the house, and Elkanah <i>who was</i> second to the king. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand women, sons, and daughters; and they also took away much <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria.</span></p> <h3>
Israel Returns the Captives</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Chr-28-9"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But a prophet of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was there, whose name <i>was</i> Oded; and he went out before the army that came to Samaria, and said to them: &#8220;Look, because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of your fathers was angry with Judah, He has delivered them into your hand; but you have killed them in a rage <i>that</i> reaches up to heaven. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And now you propose to force the children of Judah and Jerusalem to be your male and female slaves; <i>but are</i> you not also guilty before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now hear me, therefore, and return the captives, whom you have taken captive from your brethren, for the fierce wrath of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>is</i> upon you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then some of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against those who came from the war, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>and said to them, &#8220;You shall not bring the captives here, for we <i>already</i> have offended the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. You intend to add to our sins and to our guilt; for our guilt is great, and <i>there is</i> fierce wrath against Israel.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So the armed men left the captives and the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>spoil before the leaders and all the assembly. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then the men who were designated by name rose up and took the captives, and from the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>spoil they clothed all who were naked among them, dressed them and gave them sandals, gave them food and drink, and anointed them; and they let all the feeble ones ride on donkeys. So they brought them to their brethren at Jericho, the city of palm trees. Then they returned to Samaria.</span></p> <h3>
Assyria Refuses to Help Judah</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Chr-28-16"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>At the same time King Ahaz sent to the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>kings of Assyria to help him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>For again the Edomites had come, attacked Judah, and carried away captives. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland and of the South of Judah, and had taken Beth Shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Sochoh with its villages, Timnah with its villages, and Gimzo with its villages; and they dwelt there. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>For the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel, for he had encouraged moral decline in Judah and had been continually unfaithful to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Also Tiglath-Pileser<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span> king of Assyria came to him and distressed him, and did not assist him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>For Ahaz took part <i>of the treasures</i> from the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, from the house of the king, and from the leaders, and he gave <i>it</i> to the king of Assyria; but he did not help him.</span></p> <h3>
Apostasy and Death of Ahaz</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Chr-28-22"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Now in the time of his distress King Ahaz became increasingly unfaithful to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. This <i>is that</i> King Ahaz. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus which had defeated him, saying, &#8220;Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them, I will sacrifice to them that they may help me.&#8221; But they were the ruin of him and of all Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>So Ahaz gathered the articles of the house of God, cut in pieces the articles of the house of God, shut up the doors of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and made for himself altars in every corner of Jerusalem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And in every single city of Judah he made <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>high places to burn incense to other gods, and provoked to anger the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of his fathers.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Now the rest of his acts and all his ways, from first to last, indeed they <i>are</i> written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>So Ahaz <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>rested with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, in Jerusalem; but they did not bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel. Then Hezekiah his son reigned in his place.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-11769a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 28:4">2 Chronicles 28:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Places for pagan worship</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11773b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 28:8">2 Chronicles 28:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>plunder</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11779c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 28:14">2 Chronicles 28:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>plunder</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11780d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 28:15">2 Chronicles 28:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>plunder</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11781e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 28:16">2 Chronicles 28:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>LXX, Syr., Vg. <i>king</i> (cf. v. <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Chr.28.20" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Chr.28.20&amp;version=NKJV">20</span>)</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11784f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 28:19">2 Chronicles 28:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>humbled Judah</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11785g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 28:20">2 Chronicles 28:20</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. <i>Tilgath-Pilneser</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11790h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 28:25">2 Chronicles 28:25</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Places for pagan worship</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11792i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 28:27">2 Chronicles 28:27</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Died and joined his ancestors</span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
