<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>He built <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>Elath and restored it to Judah, after the king rested with his fathers.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Uzziah <i>was</i> sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother&#8217;s name was Jecholiah of Jerusalem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And he did <i>what was</i> right in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, according to all that his father Amaziah had done. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>He sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>visions of God; and as long as he sought the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, God made him prosper.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now he went out and made war against the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath, the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod; and he built cities <i>around</i> Ashdod and among the Philistines. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>God helped him against the Philistines, against the Arabians who lived in Gur Baal, and against the Meunites. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Also the Ammonites brought tribute to Uzziah. His fame spread as far as the entrance of Egypt, for he became exceedingly strong.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, at the Valley Gate, and at the corner buttress of the wall; then he fortified them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Also he built towers in the desert. He dug many wells, for he had much livestock, both in the lowlands and in the plains; <i>he also had</i> farmers and vinedressers in the mountains and in <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>Carmel, for he loved the soil.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Moreover Uzziah had an army of fighting men who went out to war by companies, according to the number on their roll as prepared by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer, under the hand of Hananiah, <i>one</i> of the king&#8217;s captains. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>The total number of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>chief officers of the mighty men of valor <i>was</i> two thousand six hundred. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And under their authority <i>was</i> an army of three hundred and seven thousand five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then Uzziah prepared for them, for the entire army, shields, spears, helmets, body armor, bows, and slings <i>to cast</i> stones. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And he made devices in Jerusalem, invented by skillful men, to be on the towers and the corners, to shoot arrows and large stones. So his fame spread far and wide, for he was marvelously helped till he became strong.</span></p> <h3>
The Penalty for Uzziah&#8217;s Pride</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Chr-26-16"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But when he was strong his heart was lifted up, to <i>his</i> destruction, for he transgressed against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> his God by entering the temple of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> to burn incense on the altar of incense. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him were eighty priests of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8212;valiant men. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And they withstood King Uzziah, and said to him, &#8220;<i>It</i> <i>is</i> not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, but for the priests, the sons of Aaron, who are consecrated to burn incense. Get out of the sanctuary, for you have trespassed! You <i>shall have</i> no honor from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then Uzziah became furious; and he <i>had</i> a censer in his hand to burn incense. And while he was angry with the priests, leprosy broke out on his forehead, before the priests in the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, beside the incense altar. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And Azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked at him, and there, on his forehead, he <i>was</i> leprous; so they thrust him out of that place. Indeed he also hurried to get out, because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had struck him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>King Uzziah was a leper until the day of his death. He dwelt in an isolated house, because he was a leper; for he was cut off from the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. Then Jotham his son <i>was</i> over the king&#8217;s house, judging the people of the land.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, from first to last, the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz wrote. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>So Uzziah <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>rested with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which <i>belonged</i> to the kings, for they said, &#8220;He is a leper.&#8221; Then Jotham his son reigned in his place.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-11734a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 26:1">2 Chronicles 26:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Azariah,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Kgs.14.21-2Kgs.14.29" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Kgs.14.21-2Kgs.14.29&amp;version=NKJV">2 Kin. 14:21ff.</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11735b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 26:2">2 Chronicles 26:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. <i>Eloth</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11738c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 26:5">2 Chronicles 26:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. mss., LXX, Syr., Tg., Arab. <i>fear</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11743d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 26:10">2 Chronicles 26:10</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>the fertile fields</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11745e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 26:12">2 Chronicles 26:12</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>chief fathers</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11756f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 26:23">2 Chronicles 26:23</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Died and joined his ancestors</span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
