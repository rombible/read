<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, to the judges, and to every leader in all Israel, the heads of the fathers&#8217; <i>houses.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then Solomon, and all the assembly with him, went to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>the high place that <i>was</i> at Gibeon; for the tabernacle of meeting with God was there, which Moses the servant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had made in the wilderness. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But David had brought up the ark of God from Kirjath Jearim to <i>the place</i> David had prepared for it, for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now the bronze altar that Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>he put before the tabernacle of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; Solomon and the assembly sought Him <i>there.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, which <i>was</i> at the tabernacle of meeting, and offered a thousand burnt offerings on it.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>On that night God appeared to Solomon, and said to him, &#8220;Ask! What shall I give you?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And Solomon said to God: &#8220;You have shown great mercy to David my father, and have made me king in his place. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Now, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God, let Your promise to David my father be established, for You have made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Now give me wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this great people of Yours?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then God said to Solomon: &#8220;Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked riches or wealth or honor or the life of your enemies, nor have you asked long life&#8212;but have asked wisdom and knowledge for yourself, that you may judge My people over whom I have made you king&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>wisdom and knowledge <i>are</i> granted to you; and I will give you riches and wealth and honor, such as none of the kings have had who <i>were</i> before you, nor shall any after you have the like.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Solomon&#8217;s Military and Economic Power</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Chr-1-13"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So Solomon came to Jerusalem from <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>the high place that <i>was</i> at Gibeon, from before the tabernacle of meeting, and reigned over Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen; he had one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Also the king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedars as abundant as the sycamores which <i>are</i> in the lowland. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And Solomon had horses imported from Egypt and Keveh; the king&#8217;s merchants bought them in Keveh at the <i>current</i> price. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>They also acquired and imported from Egypt a chariot for six hundred <i>shekels</i> of silver, and a horse for one hundred and fifty; thus, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>through their agents, they exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-11198a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 1:3">2 Chronicles 1:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Place for worship</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11200b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 1:5">2 Chronicles 1:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Some authorities <i>it was there</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11208c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 1:13">2 Chronicles 1:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Place for worship</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11212d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 1:17">2 Chronicles 1:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>by their hands</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
