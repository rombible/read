Then Jehoram his son reigned in his place. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>He had brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azaryahu, Michael, and Shephatiah; all these <i>were</i> the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Their father gave them great gifts of silver and gold and precious things, with fortified cities in Judah; but he gave the kingdom to Jehoram, because he <i>was</i> the firstborn.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Now when Jehoram <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>was established over the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself and killed all his brothers with the sword, and also <i>others</i> of the princes of Israel.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Jehoram <i>was</i> thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab had done, for he had the daughter of Ahab as a wife; and he did evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Yet the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that He had made with David, and since He had promised to give a lamp to him and to his sons forever.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>In his days Edom revolted against Judah&#8217;s authority, and made a king over themselves. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So Jehoram went out with his officers, and all his chariots with him. And he rose by night and attacked the Edomites who had surrounded him and the captains of the chariots. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Thus Edom has been in revolt against Judah&#8217;s authority to this day. At that time Libnah revolted against his rule, because he had forsaken the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of his fathers. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Moreover he made <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit harlotry, and led Judah astray.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And a letter came to him from Elijah the prophet, saying,</span></p><div class="left-1 top-1"><p class="first-line-none"><span class="text 2Chr-21-12">Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of your father David:</span></p><p class="first-line-none"><span class="text 2Chr-21-12">Because you have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat your father, or in the ways of Asa king of Judah, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and have made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the harlot like the harlotry of the house of Ahab, and also have killed your brothers, those of your father&#8217;s household, <i>who were</i> better than yourself, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>behold, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will strike your people with a serious affliction&#8212;your children, your wives, and all your possessions; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and you <i>will become</i> very sick with a disease of your intestines, until your intestines come out by reason of the sickness, day by day.</span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Moreover the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines and the Arabians who <i>were</i> near the Ethiopians. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And they came up into Judah and invaded it, and carried away all the possessions that were found in the king&#8217;s house, and also his sons and his wives, so that there was not a son left to him except <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>After all this the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> struck him in his intestines with an incurable disease. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then it happened in the course of time, after the end of two years, that his intestines came out because of his sickness; so he died in severe pain. And his people made no <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>burning for him, like the burning for his fathers.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>He was thirty-two years old when he became king. He reigned in Jerusalem eight years and, to no one&#8217;s sorrow, departed. However they buried him in the City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-11626a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 21:1">2 Chronicles 21:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Died and joined his ancestors</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11629b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 21:4">2 Chronicles 21:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>arose</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11636c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 21:11">2 Chronicles 21:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Places for pagan worship</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11642d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 21:17">2 Chronicles 21:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Ahaziah</i> or <i>Azariah,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Chr.22.1" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Chr.22.1&amp;version=NKJV">2 Chr. 22:1</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11644e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 21:19">2 Chronicles 21:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Burning of spices</span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
