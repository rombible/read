His mother&#8217;s name <i>was</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>Jerushah the daughter of Zadok. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he did <i>what was</i> right in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, according to all that his father Uzziah had done (although he did not enter the temple of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>). But still the people acted corruptly.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>He built the Upper Gate of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and he built extensively on the wall of Ophel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the forests he built fortresses and towers. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>He also fought with the king of the Ammonites and defeated them. And the people of Ammon gave him in that year one hundred talents of silver, ten thousand kors of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. The people of Ammon paid this to him in the second and third years also. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So Jotham became mighty, because he prepared his ways before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> his God.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars and his ways, indeed they <i>are</i> written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So Jotham <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>rested with his fathers, and they buried him in the City of David.
