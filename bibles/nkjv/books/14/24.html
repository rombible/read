His mother&#8217;s name <i>was</i> Zibiah of Beersheba. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Joash did <i>what was</i> right in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> all the days of Jehoiada the priest. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And Jehoiada took two wives for him, and he had sons and daughters.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Now it happened after this <i>that</i> Joash set his heart on repairing the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then he gathered the priests and the Levites, and said to them, &#8220;Go out to the cities of Judah, and gather from all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that you do it quickly.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Chr-24-5">However the Levites did not do it quickly. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So the king called Jehoiada the chief <i>priest,</i> and said to him, &#8220;Why have you not required the Levites to bring in from Judah and from Jerusalem the collection, <i>according to the commandment</i> of Moses the servant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and of the assembly of Israel, for the tabernacle of witness?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken into the house of God, and had also presented all the dedicated things of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> to the Baals.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then at the king&#8217;s command they made a chest, and set it outside at the gate of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And they made a proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to bring to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> the collection <i>that</i> Moses the servant of God <i>had imposed</i> on Israel in the wilderness. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then all the leaders and all the people rejoiced, brought their contributions, and put <i>them</i> into the chest until all had given. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So it was, at that time, when the chest was brought to the king&#8217;s official by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that <i>there was</i> much money, that the king&#8217;s scribe and the high priest&#8217;s officer came and emptied the chest, and took it and returned it to its place. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>The king and Jehoiada gave it to those who did the work of the service of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; and they hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and also those who worked in iron and bronze to restore the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So the workmen labored, and the work was completed by them; they restored the house of God to its original condition and reinforced it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>When they had finished, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada; they made from it articles for the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, articles for serving and offering, spoons and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt offerings in the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> continually all the days of Jehoiada.</span></p> <h3>
Apostasy of Joash</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Chr-24-15"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But Jehoiada grew old and was full of days, and he died; <i>he was</i> one hundred and thirty years old when he died. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And they buried him in the City of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, both toward God and His house.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Now after the death of Jehoiada the leaders of Judah came and bowed down to the king. And the king listened to them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Therefore they left the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of their fathers, and served wooden images and idols; and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem because of their trespass. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Yet He sent prophets to them, to bring them back to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; and they testified against them, but they would not listen.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then the Spirit of God <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, who stood above the people, and said to them, &#8220;Thus says God: &#8216;Why do you transgress the commandments of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, so that you cannot prosper? Because you have forsaken the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, He also has forsaken you.&#8217; &#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>So they conspired against him, and at the command of the king they stoned him with stones in the court of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Thus Joash the king did not remember the kindness which Jehoiada his <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>father had done to him, but killed his son; and as he died, he said, &#8220;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> look on <i>it,</i> and repay!&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Death of Joash</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Chr-24-23"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>So it happened in the spring of the year <i>that</i> the army of Syria came up against him; and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the leaders of the people from among the people, and sent all their <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>spoil to the king of Damascus. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men; but the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> delivered a very great army into their hand, because they had forsaken the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of their fathers. So they executed judgment against Joash. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And when they had withdrawn from him (for they left him severely wounded), his own servants conspired against him because of the blood of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>sons of Jehoiada the priest, and killed him on his bed. So he died. And they buried him in the City of David, but they did not bury him in the tombs of the kings.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>These are the ones who conspired against him: <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>Shimrith the Moabitess. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Now <i>concerning</i> his sons, and the many oracles about him, and the repairing of the house of God, indeed they <i>are</i> written in the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>annals of the book of the kings.
