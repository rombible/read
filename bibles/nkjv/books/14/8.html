<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>that the cities which <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>Hiram had given to Solomon, Solomon built them; and he settled the children of Israel there. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And Solomon went to Hamath Zobah and seized it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>He also built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the storage cities which he built in Hamath. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>He built Upper Beth Horon and Lower Beth Horon, fortified cities <i>with</i> walls, gates, and bars, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>also Baalath and all the storage cities that Solomon had, and all the chariot cities and the cities of the cavalry, and all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>All the people <i>who were</i> left of the Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, who <i>were</i> not of Israel&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>that is, their descendants who were left in the land after them, whom the children of Israel did not destroy&#8212;from these Solomon raised forced labor, as it is to this day. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But Solomon did not make the children of Israel <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>servants for his work. Some <i>were</i> men of war, captains of his officers, captains of his chariots, and his cavalry. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And others <i>were</i> chiefs of the officials of King Solomon: two hundred and fifty, who ruled over the people.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now Solomon brought the daughter of Pharaoh up from the City of David to the house he had built for her, for he said, &#8220;My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because <i>the places</i> to which the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has come are holy.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then Solomon offered burnt offerings to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> on the altar of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> which he had built before the vestibule, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>according to the daily rate, offering according to the commandment of Moses, for the Sabbaths, the New Moons, and the three appointed yearly feasts&#8212;the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Tabernacles. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And, according to the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>order of David his father, he appointed the divisions of the priests for their service, the Levites for their duties (to praise and serve before the priests) as the duty of each day required, and the gatekeepers by their divisions at each gate; for so David the man of God had commanded. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>They did not depart from the command of the king to the priests and Levites concerning any matter or concerning the treasuries.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Now all the work of Solomon was well-ordered <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>from the day of the foundation of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> until it was finished. So the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was completed.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then Solomon went to Ezion Geber and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>Elath on the seacoast, in the land of Edom. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And Hiram sent him ships by the hand of his servants, and servants who knew the sea. They went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and acquired four hundred and fifty talents of gold from there, and brought it to King Solomon.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-11349a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 8:2">2 Chronicles 8:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. <i>Huram,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Chr.2.3" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Chr.2.3&amp;version=NKJV">2 Chr. 2:3</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11356b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 8:9">2 Chronicles 8:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>slaves</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11361c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 8:14">2 Chronicles 8:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>ordinance</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11363d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 8:16">2 Chronicles 8:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>So with LXX, Syr., Vg.; MT <i>as far as</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11364e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 8:17">2 Chronicles 8:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. <i>Eloth,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Kgs.14.22" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Kgs.14.22&amp;version=NKJV">2 Kin. 14:22</span></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
