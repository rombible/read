<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then he made the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>Sea of cast <i>bronze,</i> ten cubits from one brim to the other; <i>it was</i> completely round. Its height <i>was</i> five cubits, and a line of thirty cubits measured its circumference. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And under it <i>was</i> the likeness of oxen encircling it all around, ten to a cubit, all the way around the Sea. The oxen <i>were</i> cast in two rows, when it was cast. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>It stood on twelve oxen: three looking toward the north, three looking toward the west, three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; the Sea <i>was set</i> upon them, and all their back parts <i>pointed</i> inward. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>It <i>was</i> a handbreadth thick; and its brim was shaped like the brim of a cup, <i>like</i> a lily blossom. It contained <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>three thousand baths.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>He also made ten lavers, and put five on the right side and five on the left, to wash in them; such things as they offered for the burnt offering they would wash in them, but the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Sea <i>was</i> for the priests to wash in. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And he made ten lampstands of gold according to their design, and set <i>them</i> in the temple, five on the right side and five on the left. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>He also made ten tables, and placed <i>them</i> in the temple, five on the right side and five on the left. And he made one hundred bowls of gold.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court and doors for the court; and he overlaid these doors with bronze. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>He set the Sea on the right side, toward the southeast.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then Huram made the pots and the shovels and the bowls. So Huram finished doing the work that he was to do for King Solomon for the house of God: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>the two pillars and the bowl-shaped capitals <i>that were</i> on top of the two pillars; the two networks covering the two bowl-shaped capitals which <i>were</i> on top of the pillars; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>four hundred pomegranates for the two networks (two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowl-shaped capitals that <i>were</i> on the pillars); </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>he also made carts and the lavers on the carts; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>one Sea and twelve oxen under it; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>also the pots, the shovels, the forks&#8212;and all their articles Huram his <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>master <i>craftsman</i> made of burnished bronze for King Solomon for the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>In the plain of Jordan the king had them cast in clay molds, between Succoth and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>Zeredah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And Solomon had all these articles made in such great abundance that the weight of the bronze was not determined.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Thus Solomon had all the furnishings made for the house of God: the altar of gold and the tables on which <i>was</i> the showbread; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/4-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>the lampstands with their lamps of pure gold, to burn in the prescribed manner in front of the inner sanctuary, </span>
