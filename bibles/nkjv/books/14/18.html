<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>After some years he went down to <i>visit</i> Ahab in Samaria; and Ahab killed sheep and oxen in abundance for him and the people who were with him, and persuaded him to go up <i>with him</i> to Ramoth Gilead. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, &#8220;Will you go with me <i>against</i> Ramoth Gilead?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Chr-18-3">And he answered him, &#8220;I <i>am</i> as you <i>are,</i> and my people as your people; <i>we will be</i> with you in the war.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Also Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, &#8220;Please inquire for the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> today.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, four hundred men, and said to them, &#8220;Shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I refrain?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Chr-18-5">So they said, &#8220;Go up, for God will deliver it into the king&#8217;s hand.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But Jehoshaphat said, &#8220;<i>Is there</i> not still a prophet of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> here, that we may inquire of Him?&#8221;<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, &#8220;<i>There is</i> still one man by whom we may inquire of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; but I hate him, because he never prophesies good concerning me, but always evil. He <i>is</i> Micaiah the son of Imla.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Chr-18-7">And Jehoshaphat said, &#8220;Let not the king say such things!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then the king of Israel called one <i>of his</i> officers and said, &#8220;Bring Micaiah the son of Imla quickly!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>The king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah, clothed in <i>their</i> robes, sat each on his throne; and they sat at a threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Now Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made horns of iron for himself; and he said, &#8220;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8216;With these you shall gore the Syrians until they are destroyed.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, &#8220;Go up to Ramoth Gilead and prosper, for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will deliver <i>it</i> into the king&#8217;s hand.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then the messenger who had gone to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, &#8220;Now listen, the words of the prophets with one accord encourage the king. Therefore please let your word be like <i>the word of</i> one of them, and speak encouragement.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And Micaiah said, &#8220;<i>As</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> lives, whatever my God says, that I will speak.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then he came to the king; and the king said to him, &#8220;Micaiah, shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I refrain?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Chr-18-14">And he said, &#8220;Go and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So the king said to him, &#8220;How many times shall I make you swear that you tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then he said, &#8220;I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said, &#8216;These have no master. Let each return to his house in peace.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, &#8220;Did I not tell you he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then <i>Micaiah</i> said, &#8220;Therefore hear the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: I saw the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing on His right hand and His left. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said, &#8216;Who will persuade Ahab king of Israel to go up, that he may fall at Ramoth Gilead?&#8217; So one spoke in this manner, and another spoke in that manner. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then a spirit came forward and stood before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and said, &#8216;I will persuade him.&#8217; The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to him, &#8216;In what way?&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>So he said, &#8216;I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.&#8217; And <i>the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span></i> said, &#8216;You shall persuade <i>him</i> and also prevail; go out and do so.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Therefore look! The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these prophets of yours, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has declared disaster against you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said, &#8220;Which way did the spirit from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> go from me to speak to you?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And Micaiah said, &#8220;Indeed you shall see on that day when you go into an inner chamber to hide!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then the king of Israel said, &#8220;Take Micaiah, and return him to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king&#8217;s son; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>and say, &#8216;Thus says the king: &#8220;Put this <i>fellow</i> in prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and water of affliction, until I return in peace.&#8221; &#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>But Micaiah said, &#8220;If you ever return in peace, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has not spoken by me.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Take heed, all you people!&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Ahab Dies in Battle</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Chr-18-28"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, &#8220;I will disguise myself and go into battle; but you put on your robes.&#8221; So the king of Israel disguised himself, and they went into battle.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots who <i>were</i> with him, saying, &#8220;Fight with no one small or great, but only with the king of Israel.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>So it was, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, &#8220;It <i>is</i> the king of Israel!&#8221; Therefore they surrounded him to attack; but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> helped him, and God diverted them from him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>For so it was, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Now a certain man drew a bow at random, and struck the king of Israel between the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>joints of his armor.
