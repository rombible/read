<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So it happened, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard <i>it</i> (he was in Egypt, where he had fled from the presence of King Solomon), that Jeroboam returned from Egypt. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then they sent for him and called him. And Jeroboam and all Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8220;Your father made our yoke heavy; now therefore, lighten the burdensome service of your father and his heavy yoke which he put on us, and we will serve you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So he said to them, &#8220;Come back to me after three days.&#8221; And the people departed.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then King Rehoboam consulted the elders who stood before his father Solomon while he still lived, saying, &#8220;How do you advise <i>me</i> to answer these people?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And they spoke to him, saying, &#8220;If you are kind to these people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they will be your servants forever.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But he rejected the advice which the elders had given him, and consulted the young men who had grown up with him, who stood before him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And he said to them, &#8220;What advice do you give? How should we answer this people who have spoken to me, saying, &#8216;Lighten the yoke which your father put on us&#8217;?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then the young men who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, &#8220;Thus you should speak to the people who have spoken to you, saying, &#8216;Your father made our yoke heavy, but you make <i>it</i> lighter on us&#8217;&#8212;thus you shall say to them: &#8216;My little <i>finger</i> shall be thicker than my father&#8217;s waist! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And now, whereas my father put a heavy yoke on you, I will add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I <i>will chastise you</i> with <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>scourges!&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king had directed, saying, &#8220;Come back to me the third day.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then the king answered them roughly. King Rehoboam rejected the advice of the elders, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>and he spoke to them according to the advice of the young men, saying, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>&#8220;My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it; my father chastised you with whips, but I <i>will chastise you</i> with <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>scourges!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So the king did not listen to the people; for the turn <i>of events</i> was from God, that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> might fulfill His word, which He had spoken by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Now when all Israel <i>saw</i> that the king did not listen to them, the people answered the king, saying:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text 2Chr-10-16">&#8220;What share have we in David?</span><br /><span class="text 2Chr-10-16"><i>We have</i> no inheritance in the son of Jesse.</span><br /><span class="text 2Chr-10-16">Every man to your tents, O Israel!</span><br /><span class="text 2Chr-10-16">Now see to your own house, O David!&#8221;</span></p></div><p class="top-1"><span class="text 2Chr-10-16">So all Israel departed to their tents. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But Rehoboam reigned over the children of Israel who dwelt in the cities of Judah.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who <i>was</i> in charge of revenue; but the children of Israel stoned him with stones, and he died. Therefore King Rehoboam mounted <i>his</i> chariot in haste to flee to Jerusalem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-11407a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 10:11">2 Chronicles 10:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Scourges with points or barbs, lit. <i>scorpions</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11410b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 10:14">2 Chronicles 10:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'>So with many Heb. mss., LXX, Syr., Vg.
