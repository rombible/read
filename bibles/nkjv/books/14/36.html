<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Nebuchadnezzar also carried off <i>some</i> of the articles from the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, the abominations which he did, and what was found against him, indeed they <i>are</i> written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But they mocked the messengers of God, despised His words, and scoffed at His prophets, until the wrath of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> arose against His people, till <i>there was</i> no remedy.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Therefore He brought against them the king of the Chaldeans, who killed their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion on young man or virgin, on the aged or the weak; He gave <i>them</i> all into his hand. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And all the articles from the house of God, great and small, the treasures of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and the treasures of the king and of his leaders, all <i>these</i> he took to Babylon. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then they burned the house of God, broke down the wall of Jerusalem, burned all its palaces with fire, and destroyed all its precious possessions. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And those who escaped from the sword he carried away to Babylon, where they became servants to him and his sons until the rule of the kingdom of Persia, </span>
