<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he placed troops in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim which Asa his father had taken. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Now the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the former ways of his father David; he did not seek the Baals, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>but sought <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>the God of his father, and walked in His commandments and not according to the acts of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Therefore the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> established the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah gave presents to Jehoshaphat, and he had riches and honor in abundance. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And his heart took delight in the ways of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; moreover he removed the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>high places and wooden images from Judah.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Also in the third year of his reign he sent his leaders, Ben-Hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And with them <i>he sent</i> Levites: Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tobadonijah&#8212;the Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So they taught in Judah, and <i>had</i> the Book of the Law of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> with them; they went throughout all the cities of Judah and taught the people.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And the fear of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> fell on all the kingdoms of the lands that <i>were</i> around Judah, so that they did not make war against Jehoshaphat. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Also <i>some</i> of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents and silver as tribute; and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven thousand seven hundred rams and seven thousand seven hundred male goats.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So Jehoshaphat became increasingly powerful, and he built fortresses and storage cities in Judah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>He had much property in the cities of Judah; and the men of war, mighty men of valor, <i>were</i> in Jerusalem.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>These <i>are</i> their numbers, according to their fathers&#8217; houses. Of Judah, the captains of thousands: Adnah the captain, and with him three hundred thousand mighty men of valor; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and next to him <i>was</i> Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred and eighty thousand; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>and next to him <i>was</i> Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valor. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Of Benjamin: Eliada a mighty man of valor, and with him two hundred thousand men armed with bow and shield; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>and next to him <i>was</i> Jehozabad, and with him one hundred and eighty thousand prepared for war. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>These served the king, besides those the king put in the fortified cities throughout all Judah.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-11528a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 17:4">2 Chronicles 17:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'>LXX <i>the <span class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11530b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 17:6">2 Chronicles 17:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Places for pagan worship</span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
