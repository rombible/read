<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then some came and told Jehoshaphat, saying, &#8220;A great multitude is coming against you from beyond the sea, from <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>Syria; and they are in Hazazon Tamar&#8221; (which <i>is</i> En Gedi). </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And Jehoshaphat feared, and set <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>himself to seek the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So Judah gathered together to ask <i>help</i> from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; and from all the cities of Judah they came to seek the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, before the new court, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and said: &#8220;O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of our fathers, <i>are</i> You not God in heaven, and do You <i>not</i> rule over all the kingdoms of the nations, and in Your hand <i>is there not</i> power and might, so that no one is able to withstand You? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span><i>Are</i> You not our God, <i>who</i> drove out the inhabitants of this land before Your people Israel, and gave it to the descendants of Abraham Your friend forever? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And they dwell in it, and have built You a sanctuary in it for Your name, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8216;If disaster comes upon us&#8212;sword, judgment, pestilence, or famine&#8212;we will stand before this temple and in Your presence (for Your name <i>is</i> in this temple), and cry out to You in our affliction, and You will hear and save.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And now, here are the people of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir&#8212;whom You would not let Israel invade when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned from them and did not destroy them&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>here they are, rewarding us by coming to throw us out of Your possession which You have given us to inherit. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>O our God, will You not judge them? For we have no power against this great multitude that is coming against us; nor do we know what to do, but our eyes <i>are</i> upon You.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Now all Judah, with their little ones, their wives, and their children, stood before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then the Spirit of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, in the midst of the assembly. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;Listen, all you of Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem, and you, King Jehoshaphat! Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> to you: &#8216;Do not be afraid nor dismayed because of this great multitude, for the battle <i>is</i> not yours, but God&#8217;s. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Tomorrow go down against them. They will surely come up by the Ascent of Ziz, and you will find them at the end of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>brook before the Wilderness of Jeruel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>You will not <i>need</i> to fight in this <i>battle.</i> Position yourselves, stand still and see the salvation of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, who is with you, O Judah and Jerusalem!&#8217; Do not fear or be dismayed; tomorrow go out against them, for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>is</i> with you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with <i>his</i> face to the ground, and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem bowed before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, worshiping the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then the Levites of the children of the Kohathites and of the children of the Korahites stood up to praise the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel with voices loud and high.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So they rose early in the morning and went out into the Wilderness of Tekoa; and as they went out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, &#8220;Hear me, O Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem: Believe in the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God, and you shall be established; believe His prophets, and you shall prosper.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed those who should sing to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and who should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army and were saying:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text 2Chr-20-21">&#8220;Praise the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>,</span><br /><span class="text 2Chr-20-21">For His mercy <i>endures</i> forever.&#8221;</span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Now when they began to sing and to praise, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> set ambushes against the people of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, who had come against Judah; and they were defeated. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>For the people of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir to utterly kill and destroy <i>them.</i> And when they <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, they helped to destroy one another.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>So when Judah came to a place overlooking the wilderness, they looked toward the multitude; and there <i>were</i> their dead bodies, fallen on the earth. No one had escaped.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>When Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away their spoil, they found among them an abundance of valuables on the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>dead bodies, and precious jewelry, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away; and they were three days gathering the spoil because there was so much. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And on the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>Berachah, for there they blessed the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; therefore the name of that place was called The Valley of Berachah until this day. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, with Jehoshaphat in front of them, to go back to Jerusalem with joy, for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had made them rejoice over their enemies. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>So they came to Jerusalem, with stringed instruments and harps and trumpets, to the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of <i>those</i> countries when they heard that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had fought against the enemies of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Then the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet, for his God gave him rest all around.</span></p> <h3>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And he walked in the way of his father Asa, and did not turn aside from it, doing <i>what was</i> right in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Nevertheless the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>high places were not taken away, for as yet the people had not directed their hearts to the God of their fathers.</span></p> <p>
