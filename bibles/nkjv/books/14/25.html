His mother&#8217;s name <i>was</i> Jehoaddan of Jerusalem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he did <i>what was</i> right in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, but not with a loyal heart.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Now it happened, as soon as the kingdom was established for him, that he executed his servants who had murdered his father the king. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>However he did not execute their children, but <i>did</i> as <i>it is</i> written in the Law in the Book of Moses, where the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> commanded, saying, &#8220;The fathers shall not be put to death for their children, nor shall the children be put to death for their fathers; but a person shall die for his own sin.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
The War Against Edom</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Chr-25-5"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together and set over them captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, according to <i>their</i> fathers&#8217; houses, throughout all Judah and Benjamin; and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them to be three hundred thousand choice <i>men, able</i> to go to war, who could handle spear and shield. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>He also hired one hundred thousand mighty men of valor from Israel for one hundred talents of silver. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But a man of God came to him, saying, &#8220;O king, do not let the army of Israel go with you, for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>is</i> not with Israel&#8212;<i>not with</i> any of the children of Ephraim. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But if you go, be gone! Be strong in battle! <i>Even so,</i> God shall make you fall before the enemy; for God has power to help and to overthrow.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then Amaziah said to the man of God, &#8220;But what <i>shall we</i> do about the hundred talents which I have given to the troops of Israel?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Chr-25-9">And the man of God answered, &#8220;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> is able to give you much more than this.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So Amaziah discharged the troops that had come to him from Ephraim, to go back home. Therefore their anger was greatly aroused against Judah, and they returned home in great anger.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then Amaziah strengthened himself, and leading his people, he went to the Valley of Salt and killed ten thousand of the people of Seir. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Also the children of Judah took captive ten thousand alive, brought them to the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, so that they all were dashed in pieces.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>But as for the soldiers of the army which Amaziah had discharged, so that they would not go with him to battle, they raided the cities of Judah from Samaria to Beth Horon, killed three thousand in them, and took much <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>spoil.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Now it was so, after Amaziah came from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the people of Seir, set them up <i>to be</i> his gods, and bowed down before them and burned incense to them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Therefore the anger of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was aroused against Amaziah, and He sent him a prophet who said to him, &#8220;Why have you sought the gods of the people, which could not rescue their own people from your hand?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So it was, as he talked with him, that <i>the king</i> said to him, &#8220;Have we made you the king&#8217;s counselor? Cease! Why should you be killed?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Chr-25-16">Then the prophet ceased, and said, &#8220;I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this and have not heeded my advice.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Israel Defeats Judah</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Chr-25-17"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Now Amaziah king of Judah asked advice and sent to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>Joash the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, &#8220;Come, let us face one another <i>in battle.</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, &#8220;The thistle that <i>was</i> in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, &#8216;Give your daughter to my son as wife&#8217;; and a wild beast that <i>was</i> in Lebanon passed by and trampled the thistle. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Indeed you say that you have defeated the Edomites, and your heart is lifted up to boast. Stay at home now; why should you meddle with trouble, that you should fall&#8212;you and Judah with you?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>But Amaziah would not heed, for it <i>came</i> from God, that He might give them into the hand <i>of their enemies,</i> because they sought the gods of Edom. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>So Joash king of Israel went out; and he and Amaziah king of Judah faced one another at Beth Shemesh, which <i>belongs</i> to Judah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And Judah was defeated by Israel, and every man fled to his tent. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Then Joash the king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth Shemesh; and he brought him to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate&#8212;four hundred cubits. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And <i>he took</i> all the gold and silver, all the articles that were found in the house of God with Obed-Edom, the treasures of the king&#8217;s house, and hostages, and returned to Samaria.</span></p> <h3>
Death of Amaziah</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Chr-25-25"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, lived fifteen years after the death of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, from first to last, indeed <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>After the time that Amaziah turned away from following the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish and killed him there. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then they brought him on horses and buried him with his fathers in <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>the City of Judah.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-11718a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 25:13">2 Chronicles 25:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>plunder</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11722b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 25:17">2 Chronicles 25:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Jehoash,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Kgs.14.8-2Kgs.14.29" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Kgs.14.8-2Kgs.14.29&amp;version=NKJV">2 Kin. 14:8ff.</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11733c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 25:28">2 Chronicles 25:28</span> <span class='footnote-text'>The City of David</span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
