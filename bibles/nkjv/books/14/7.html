<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And the priests could not enter the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, because the glory of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had filled the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s house. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>When all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> on the temple, they bowed their faces to the ground on the pavement, and worshiped and praised the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, <i>saying:</i></span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text 2Chr-7-3">&#8220;For <i>He is</i> good,</span><br /><span class="text 2Chr-7-3">For His mercy <i>endures</i> forever.&#8221;</span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand bulls and one hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And the priests attended to their services; the Levites also with instruments of the music of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, which King David had made to praise the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, saying, &#8220;For His mercy <i>endures</i> forever,&#8221; whenever David offered praise by their <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>ministry. The priests sounded trumpets opposite them, while all Israel stood.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Furthermore Solomon consecrated the middle of the court that <i>was</i> in front of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; for there he offered burnt offerings and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings, the grain offerings, and the fat.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>At that time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly from the entrance of Hamath to the<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> Brook of Egypt. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And on the eighth day they held a sacred assembly, for they observed the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>On the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their tents, joyful and glad of heart for the good that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had done for David, for Solomon, and for His people Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Thus Solomon finished the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and the king&#8217;s house; and Solomon successfully accomplished all that came into his heart to make in the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and in his own house.</span></p> <h3>
God&#8217;s Second Appearance to Solomon</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Chr-7-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> appeared to Solomon by night, and said to him: &#8220;I have heard your prayer, and have chosen this place for Myself as a house of sacrifice. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>When I shut up heaven and there is no rain, or command the locusts to devour the land, or send pestilence among My people, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>if My people who are called by My name will humble themselves, and pray and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Now My eyes will be open and My ears attentive to prayer <i>made</i> in this place. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>For now I have chosen and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>sanctified this house, that My name may be there forever; and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>My eyes and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>My heart will be there perpetually. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>As for you, if you walk before Me as your father David walked, and do according to all that I have commanded you, and if you keep My statutes and My judgments, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>then I will establish the throne of your kingdom, as I covenanted with David your father, saying, &#8216;You shall not fail <i>to have</i> a man as ruler in Israel.&#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>&#8220;But if you turn away and forsake My statutes and My commandments which I have set before you, and go and serve other gods, and worship them, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>then I will uproot them from My land which I have given them; and this house which I have <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>sanctified for My name I will cast out of My sight, and will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>&#8220;And <i>as for</i> this <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>house, which <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>is exalted, everyone who passes by it will be astonished and say, &#8216;Why has the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> done thus to this land and this house?&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then they will answer, &#8216;Because they forsook the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and embraced other gods, and worshiped them and served them; therefore He has brought all this calamity on them.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-11326a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 7:1">2 Chronicles 7:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>house</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11331b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 7:6">2 Chronicles 7:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>hand</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11333c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 7:8">2 Chronicles 7:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'>The Shihor, <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="1Chr.13.5" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=1Chr.13.5&amp;version=NKJV">1 Chr. 13:5</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11341d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 7:16">2 Chronicles 7:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>set apart</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11341e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 7:16">2 Chronicles 7:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>My attention</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11341f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 7:16">2 Chronicles 7:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>My concern</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11345g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 7:20">2 Chronicles 7:20</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>set apart</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11346h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 7:21">2 Chronicles 7:21</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Temple</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11346i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 7:21">2 Chronicles 7:21</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>was</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
