<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he went out <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>to meet Asa, and said to him: &#8220;Hear me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin. The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>is</i> with you while you are with Him. If you seek Him, He will be found by you; but if you forsake Him, He will forsake you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For a long time Israel <i>has been</i> without the true God, without a teaching priest, and without law; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>but when in their trouble they turned to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel, and sought Him, He was found by them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And in those times <i>there was</i> no peace to the one who went out, nor to the one who came in, but great turmoil <i>was</i> on all the inhabitants of the lands. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So nation was <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>destroyed by nation, and city by city, for God troubled them with every adversity. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But you, be strong and do not let your hands be weak, for your work shall be rewarded!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And when Asa heard these words and the prophecy of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Oded the prophet, he took courage, and removed the abominable idols from all the land of Judah and Benjamin and from the cities which he had taken in the mountains of Ephraim; and he restored the altar of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> that <i>was</i> before the vestibule of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and those who dwelt with them from Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon, for they came over to him in great numbers from Israel when they saw that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> his God was with him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So they gathered together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And they offered to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>at that time seven hundred bulls and seven thousand sheep from the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>spoil they had brought. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then they entered into a covenant to seek the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>and whoever would not seek the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel was to be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then they took an oath before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> with a loud voice, with shouting and trumpets and rams&#8217; horns. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And all Judah rejoiced at the oath, for they had sworn with all their heart and sought Him with all their soul; and He was found by them, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> gave them rest all around.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Also he removed Maachah, the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>mother of Asa the king, from <i>being</i> queen mother, because she had made an obscene image of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>Asherah; and Asa cut down her obscene image, then crushed and burned <i>it</i> by the Brook Kidron. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>high places were not removed from Israel. Nevertheless the heart of Asa was loyal all his days.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>He also brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated and that he himself had dedicated: silver and gold and utensils. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And there was no war until the thirty-fifth year of the reign of Asa.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-11493a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 15:2">2 Chronicles 15:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>before</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11497b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 15:6">2 Chronicles 15:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>beaten in pieces</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11499c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 15:8">2 Chronicles 15:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'>So with MT, LXX; Syr., Vg. <i>Azariah the son of Oded</i> (cf. v. <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Chr.15.1" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Chr.15.1&amp;version=NKJV">1</span>)</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11502d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 15:11">2 Chronicles 15:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>in that day</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11502e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 15:11">2 Chronicles 15:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>plunder</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11507f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 15:16">2 Chronicles 15:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>grandmother</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11507g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 15:16">2 Chronicles 15:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>A Canaanite deity</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11508h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 15:17">2 Chronicles 15:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Places for pagan worship</span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
