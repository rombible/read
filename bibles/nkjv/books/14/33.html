<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>But he did evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, according to the abominations of the nations whom the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had cast out before the children of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For he rebuilt the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down; he raised up altars for the Baals, and made wooden images; and he worshiped all <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>the host of heaven and served them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>He also built altars in the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, of which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had said, &#8220;In Jerusalem shall My name be forever.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Also he caused his sons to pass through the fire in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom; he practiced soothsaying, used witchcraft and sorcery, and consulted mediums and spiritists. He did much evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, to provoke Him to anger. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>He even set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, &#8220;In this house and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put My name forever; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>and I will not again remove the foot of Israel from the land which I have appointed for your fathers&#8212;only if they are careful to do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So Manasseh seduced Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to do more evil than the nations whom the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had destroyed before the children of Israel.</span></p> <h3>
Manasseh Restored After Repentance</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Chr-33-10"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Manasseh and his people, but they would not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>listen. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Therefore the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> brought upon them the captains of the army of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh with <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>hooks, bound him with <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>bronze <i>fetters,</i> and carried him off to Babylon. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now when he was in affliction, he implored the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>and prayed to Him; and He received his entreaty, heard his supplication, and brought him back to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>was</i> God.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>After this he built a wall outside the City of David on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, as far as the entrance of the Fish Gate; and <i>it</i> enclosed Ophel, and he raised it to a very great height. Then he put military captains in all the fortified cities of Judah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>He took away the foreign gods and the idol from the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and in Jerusalem; and he cast <i>them</i> out of the city. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>He also repaired the altar of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, sacrificed peace offerings and thank offerings on it, and commanded Judah to serve the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Nevertheless the people still sacrificed on the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>high places, <i>but</i> only to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> their God.</span></p> <h3>
Death of Manasseh</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Chr-33-18"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel, indeed they <i>are written</i> in the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>book of the kings of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Also his prayer and <i>how God</i> received his entreaty, and all his sin and trespass, and the sites where he built <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>high places and set up wooden images and carved images, before he was humbled, indeed they <i>are</i> written among the sayings of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>Hozai. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So Manasseh rested with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house. Then his son Amon reigned in his place.</span></p> <h3>
Amon&#8217;s Reign and Death</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Chr-33-21"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Amon <i>was</i> twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But he did evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, as his father Manasseh had done; for Amon sacrificed to all the carved images which his father Manasseh had made, and served them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And he did not humble himself before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, as his father Manasseh had humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then his servants conspired against him, and killed him in his own house. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>But the people of the land executed all those who had conspired against King Amon. Then the people of the land made his son Josiah king in his place.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-11912a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 33:3">2 Chronicles 33:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Places for pagan worship</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11912b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 33:3">2 Chronicles 33:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>The gods of the Assyrians</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11916c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 33:7">2 Chronicles 33:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Temple</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11919d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 33:10">2 Chronicles 33:10</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>obey</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11920e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 33:11">2 Chronicles 33:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Nose hooks, <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Kgs.19.28" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Kgs.19.28&amp;version=NKJV">2 Kin. 19:28</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11920f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 33:11">2 Chronicles 33:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>chains</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11926g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 33:17">2 Chronicles 33:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Places for pagan worship</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11927h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 33:18">2 Chronicles 33:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>words</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11928i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 33:19">2 Chronicles 33:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Places for pagan worship</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11928j"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 33:19">2 Chronicles 33:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'>LXX <i>the seers</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
