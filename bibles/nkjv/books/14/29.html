His mother&#8217;s name <i>was</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>Abijah the daughter of Zechariah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he did <i>what was</i> right in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, according to all that his father David had done.</span></p> <h3>
Hezekiah Cleanses the Temple</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Chr-29-3"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>In the first year of his reign, in the first month, he opened the doors of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and repaired them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them in the East Square, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and said to them: &#8220;Hear me, Levites! Now <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>sanctify yourselves, sanctify the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of your fathers, and carry out the rubbish from the holy <i>place.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>For our fathers have trespassed and done evil in the eyes of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God; they have forsaken Him, have turned their faces away from the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>dwelling place of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and turned <i>their</i> backs <i>on Him.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>They have also shut up the doors of the vestibule, put out the lamps, and have not burned incense or offered burnt offerings in the holy <i>place</i> to the God of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Therefore the wrath of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> fell upon Judah and Jerusalem, and He has given them up to trouble, to desolation, and to jeering, as you see with your eyes. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For indeed, because of this our fathers have fallen by the sword; and our sons, our daughters, and our wives <i>are</i> in captivity.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8220;Now <i>it is</i> in my heart to make a covenant with the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel, that His fierce wrath may turn away from us. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>My sons, do not be negligent now, for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has chosen you to stand before Him, to serve Him, and that you should minister to Him and burn incense.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then these Levites arose: Mahath the son of Amasai and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites; of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi and Azariah the son of Jehallelel; of the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah and Eden the son of Joah; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>of the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeiel; of the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah; </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And they gathered their brethren, sanctified<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span> themselves, and went according to the commandment of the king, at the words of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, to cleanse the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then the priests went into the inner part of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> to cleanse <i>it,</i> and brought out all the debris that they found in the temple of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> to the court of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. And the Levites took <i>it</i> out and carried <i>it</i> to the Brook Kidron.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Now they began to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>sanctify on the first <i>day</i> of the first month, and on the eighth day of the month they came to the vestibule of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. So they sanctified the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> in eight days, and on the sixteenth day of the first month they finished.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then they went in to King Hezekiah and said, &#8220;We have cleansed all the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, the altar of burnt offerings with all its articles, and the table of the showbread with all its articles. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Moreover all the articles which King Ahaz in his reign had cast aside in his transgression we have prepared and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>sanctified; and there they <i>are,</i> before the altar of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Hezekiah Restores Temple Worship</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Chr-29-20"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then King Hezekiah rose early, gathered the rulers of the city, and went up to the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And they brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven male goats for a sin offering for the kingdom, for the sanctuary, and for Judah. Then he commanded the priests, the sons of Aaron, to offer <i>them</i> on the altar of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So they killed the bulls, and the priests received the blood and sprinkled <i>it</i> on the altar. Likewise they killed the rams and sprinkled the blood on the altar. They also killed the lambs and sprinkled the blood on the altar. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Then they brought out the male goats <i>for</i> the sin offering before the king and the assembly, and they laid their hands on them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And the priests killed them; and they presented their blood on the altar as a sin offering to make an atonement for all Israel, for the king commanded <i>that</i> the burnt offering and the sin offering <i>be made</i> for all Israel.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And he stationed the Levites in the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> with cymbals, with stringed instruments, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, of Gad the king&#8217;s seer, and of Nathan the prophet; for thus <i>was</i> the commandment of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> by His prophets. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>The Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Then Hezekiah commanded <i>them</i> to offer the burnt offering on the altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>also</i> began, with the trumpets and with the instruments of David king of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>So all the assembly worshiped, the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded; all <i>this continued</i> until the burnt offering was finished. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And when they had finished offering, the king and all who were present with him bowed and worshiped. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Moreover King Hezekiah and the leaders commanded the Levites to sing praise to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> with the words of David and of Asaph the seer. So they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshiped.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Then Hezekiah answered and said, &#8220;Now <i>that</i> you have consecrated yourselves to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, come near, and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221; So the assembly brought in sacrifices and thank offerings, and as many as were of a willing heart <i>brought</i> burnt offerings. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And the number of the burnt offerings which the assembly brought was seventy bulls, one hundred rams, <i>and</i> two hundred lambs; all these <i>were</i> for a burnt offering to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>The consecrated things <i>were</i> six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>But the priests were too few, so that they could not skin all the burnt offerings; therefore their brethren the Levites helped them until the work was ended and until the <i>other</i> priests had <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>sanctified themselves, for the Levites were more diligent in sanctifying themselves than the priests. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Also the burnt offerings <i>were</i> in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings and <i>with</i> the drink offerings for <i>every</i> burnt offering.</span></p><p><span class="text 2Chr-29-35">So the service of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was set in order. </span>
