<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother&#8217;s name <i>was</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah.</span></p><p><span class="text 2Chr-13-2">And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Abijah set the battle in order with an army of valiant warriors, four hundred thousand choice men. Jeroboam also drew up in battle formation against him with eight hundred thousand choice men, mighty men of valor.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim, which <i>is</i> in the mountains of Ephraim, and said, &#8220;Hear me, Jeroboam and all Israel: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Should you not know that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel gave the dominion over Israel to David forever, to him and his sons, by a covenant of salt? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up and rebelled against his lord. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then worthless rogues gathered to him, and strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and inexperienced and could not withstand them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And now you think to withstand the kingdom of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, which is in the hand of the sons of David; and you <i>are</i> a great multitude, and with you are the gold calves which Jeroboam made for you as gods. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Have you not cast out the priests of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made for yourselves priests, like the peoples of <i>other</i> lands, so that whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams may be a priest of <i>things that are</i> not gods? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>But as for us, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>is</i> our God, and we have not forsaken Him; and the priests who minister to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>are</i> the sons of Aaron, and the Levites <i>attend</i> to <i>their</i> duties. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And they burn to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense; <i>they</i> also <i>set</i> the showbread <i>in order on</i> the pure <i>gold</i> table, and the lampstand of gold with its lamps to burn every evening; for we keep the command of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God, but you have forsaken Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now look, God Himself is with us as <i>our</i> head, and His priests with sounding trumpets to sound the alarm against you. O children of Israel, do not fight against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of your fathers, for you shall not prosper!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>But Jeroboam caused an ambush to go around behind them; so they were in front of Judah, and the ambush <i>was</i> behind them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And when Judah looked around, to their surprise the battle line <i>was</i> at both front and rear; and they cried out to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and the priests sounded the trumpets. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then the men of Judah gave a shout; and as the men of Judah shouted, it happened that God struck Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And the children of Israel fled before Judah, and God delivered them into their hand. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then Abijah and his people struck them with a great slaughter; so five hundred thousand choice men of Israel fell slain. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Thus the children of Israel were subdued at that time; and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied on the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of their fathers.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And Abijah pursued Jeroboam and took cities from him: Bethel with its villages, Jeshanah with its villages, and Ephrain<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span> with its villages. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So Jeroboam did not recover strength again in the days of Abijah; and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> struck him, and he died.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>But Abijah grew mighty, married fourteen wives, and begot twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Now the rest of the acts of Abijah, his ways, and his sayings <i>are</i> written in the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>annals of the prophet Iddo.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-11456a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 13:2">2 Chronicles 13:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Maachah,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="1Kgs.15.2" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=1Kgs.15.2&amp;version=NKJV">1 Kin. 15:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Chr.11.20" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Chr.11.20&amp;version=NKJV">2 Chr. 11:20</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Chr.11.21" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Chr.11.21&amp;version=NKJV">21</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11473b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 13:19">2 Chronicles 13:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>Ephron</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11476c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 13:22">2 Chronicles 13:22</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>commentary,</i> Heb. <i>midrash</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
