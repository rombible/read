<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>But the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8220;Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8216;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8220;You shall not go up or fight against your brethren! Let every man return to his house, for this thing is from Me.&#8221; &#8217; &#8221; Therefore they obeyed the words of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and turned back from attacking Jeroboam.</span></p> <h3>
Rehoboam Fortifies the Cities</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Chr-11-5"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defense in Judah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And he built Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Beth Zur, Sochoh, Adullam, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Gath, Mareshah, Ziph, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and Benjamin, fortified cities. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And he fortified the strongholds, and put captains in them, and stores of food, oil, and wine. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Also in every city <i>he put</i> shields and spears, and made them very strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side.</span></p> <h3>
Priests and Levites Move to Judah</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Chr-11-13"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And from all their territories the priests and the Levites who <i>were</i> in all Israel took their stand with him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For the Levites left their common-lands and their possessions and came to Judah and Jerusalem, for Jeroboam and his sons had rejected them from serving as priests to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then he appointed for himself priests for the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>high places, for the demons, and the calf idols which he had made. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>after <i>the</i> Levites <i>left,</i> those from all the tribes of Israel, such as set their heart to seek the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel, came to Jerusalem to sacrifice to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of their fathers. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong for three years, because they walked in the way of David and Solomon for three years.</span></p> <h3>
The Family of Rehoboam</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Chr-11-18"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then Rehoboam took for himself as wife Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David, <i>and of</i> Abihail the daughter of Eliah the son of Jesse. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And she bore him children: Jeush, Shamariah, and Zaham. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>After her he took Maachah the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>granddaughter of Absalom; and she bore him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Now Rehoboam loved Maachah the granddaughter of Absalom more than all his wives and his concubines; for he took eighteen wives and sixty concubines, and begot twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maachah as chief, <i>to be</i> leader among his brothers; for he <i>intended</i> to make him king. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>He dealt wisely, and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>dispersed some of his sons throughout all the territories of Judah and Benjamin, to every fortified city; and he gave them provisions in abundance.
