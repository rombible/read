Asa Reigns in Judah</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Chr-14-2"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Asa did <i>what was</i> good and right in the eyes of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> his God, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>for he removed the altars of the foreign <i>gods</i> and the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>high places, and broke down the <i>sacred</i> pillars and cut down the wooden images. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>He commanded Judah to seek the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of their fathers, and to observe the law and the commandment. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>He also removed the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>high places and the incense altars from all the cities of Judah, and the kingdom was quiet under him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And he built fortified cities in Judah, for the land had rest; he had no war in those years, because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had given him rest. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Therefore he said to Judah, &#8220;Let us build these cities and make walls around <i>them,</i> and towers, gates, and bars, <i>while</i> the land <i>is</i> yet before us, because we have sought the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God; we have sought <i>Him,</i> and He has given us rest on every side.&#8221; So they built and prospered. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And Asa had an army of three hundred thousand from Judah who carried <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>shields and spears, and from Benjamin two hundred and eighty thousand men who carried shields and drew bows; all these <i>were</i> mighty men of valor.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then Zerah the Ethiopian came out against them with an army of a million men and three hundred chariots, and he came to Mareshah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So Asa went out against him, and they set the troops in battle array in the Valley of Zephathah at Mareshah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And Asa cried out to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> his God, and said, &#8220;<span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, <i>it is</i> nothing for You to help, whether with many or with those who have no power; help us, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God, for we rest on You, and in Your name we go against this multitude. O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, You <i>are</i> our God; do not let man prevail against You!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> struck the Ethiopians before Asa and Judah, and the Ethiopians fled. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And Asa and the people who <i>were</i> with him pursued them to Gerar. So the Ethiopians were overthrown, and they could not recover, for they were broken before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and His army. And they carried away very much <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>spoil. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then they defeated all the cities around Gerar, for the fear of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came upon them; and they plundered all the cities, for there was exceedingly much <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>spoil in them. </span>
