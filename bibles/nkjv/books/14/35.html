<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he set the priests in their duties and encouraged them for the service of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then he said to the Levites who taught all Israel, who were holy to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8220;Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David, king of Israel, built. <i>It shall</i> no longer <i>be</i> a burden on <i>your</i> shoulders. Now serve the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God and His people Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Prepare <i>yourselves</i> according to your fathers&#8217; <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>houses, according to your divisions, following the written instruction of David king of Israel and the written instruction of Solomon his son. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And stand in the holy <i>place</i> according to the divisions of the fathers&#8217; houses of your brethren the <i>lay</i> people, and <i>according to</i> the division of the father&#8217;s house of the Levites. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So slaughter the Passover <i>offerings,</i> consecrate yourselves, and prepare <i>them</i> for your brethren, that <i>they</i> may do according to the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> by the hand of Moses.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then Josiah gave the <i>lay</i> people lambs and young goats from the flock, all for Passover <i>offerings</i> for all who were present, to the number of thirty thousand, as well as three thousand cattle; these <i>were</i> from the king&#8217;s possessions. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And his leaders gave willingly to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave to the priests for the Passover <i>offerings</i> two thousand six hundred <i>from the flock,</i> and three hundred cattle. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Also Conaniah, his brothers Shemaiah and Nethanel, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave to the Levites for Passover <i>offerings</i> five thousand <i>from the flock</i> and five hundred cattle.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their places, and the Levites in their divisions, according to the king&#8217;s command. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And they slaughtered the Passover <i>offerings;</i> and the priests sprinkled <i>the blood</i> with their hands, while the Levites skinned <i>the animals.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then they removed the burnt offerings that <i>they</i> might give them to the divisions of the fathers&#8217; houses of the <i>lay</i> people, to offer to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, as <i>it is</i> written in the Book of Moses. And so <i>they did</i> with the cattle. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Also they roasted the Passover <i>offerings</i> with fire according to the ordinance; but the <i>other</i> holy <i>offerings</i> they boiled in pots, in caldrons, and in pans, and divided <i>them</i> quickly among all the <i>lay</i> people. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then afterward they prepared portions for themselves and for the priests, because the priests, the sons of Aaron, <i>were busy</i> in offering burnt offerings and fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared portions for themselves and for the priests, the sons of Aaron. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And the singers, the sons of Asaph, <i>were</i> in their places, according to the command of David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun the king&#8217;s seer. Also the gatekeepers were at each gate; they did not have to leave their position, because their brethren the Levites prepared portions for them.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So all the service of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was prepared the same day, to keep the Passover and to offer burnt offerings on the altar of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, according to the command of King Josiah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And the children of Israel who were present kept the Passover at that time, and the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>There had been no Passover kept in Israel like that since the days of Samuel the prophet; and none of the kings of Israel had kept such a Passover as Josiah kept, with the priests and the Levites, all Judah and Israel who were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah this Passover was kept.</span></p> <h3>
Josiah Dies in Battle</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Chr-35-20"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Carchemish by the Euphrates; and Josiah went out against him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>But he sent messengers to him, saying, &#8220;What have I to do with you, king of Judah? <i>I have</i> not <i>come</i> against you this day, but against the house with which I have war; for God commanded me to make haste. Refrain <i>from meddling with</i> God, who <i>is</i> with me, lest He destroy you.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself so that he might fight with him, and did not heed the words of Necho from the mouth of God. So he came to fight in the Valley of Megiddo.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And the archers shot King Josiah; and the king said to his servants, &#8220;Take me away, for I am severely wounded.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>His servants therefore took him out of that chariot and put him in the second chariot that he had, and they brought him to Jerusalem. So he died, and was buried in <i>one of</i> the tombs of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Jeremiah also lamented for Josiah. And to this day all the singing men and the singing women speak of Josiah in their lamentations. They made it a custom in Israel; and indeed they <i>are</i> written in the Laments.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and his goodness, according to <i>what was</i> written in the Law of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>and his deeds from first to last, indeed they <i>are</i> written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-11971a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 35:4">2 Chronicles 35:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>households</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
