<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to King Jehoshaphat, &#8220;Should you help the wicked and love those who hate the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>? Therefore the wrath of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>is</i> upon you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Nevertheless good things are found in you, in that you have removed the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>wooden images from the land, and have prepared your heart to seek God.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
The Reforms of Jehoshaphat</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Chr-19-4"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem; and he went out again among the people from Beersheba to the mountains of Ephraim, and brought them back to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of their fathers. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then he set judges in the land throughout all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and said to the judges, &#8220;Take heed to what you are doing, for you do not judge for man but for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, who <i>is</i> with you <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>in the judgment. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now therefore, let the fear of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> be upon you; take care and do <i>it,</i> for <i>there is</i> no iniquity with the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God, no partiality, nor taking of bribes.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Moreover in Jerusalem, for the judgment of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and for controversies, Jehoshaphat appointed some of the Levites and priests, and some of the chief fathers of Israel, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>when they returned to Jerusalem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And he commanded them, saying, &#8220;Thus you shall act in the fear of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, faithfully and with a loyal heart: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Whatever case comes to you from your brethren who dwell in their cities, whether of bloodshed or offenses against law or commandment, against statutes or ordinances, you shall warn them, lest they trespass against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and wrath come upon you and your brethren. Do this, and you will not be guilty. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And take notice: Amariah the chief priest <i>is</i> over you in all matters of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, for all the king&#8217;s matters; also the Levites <i>will be</i> officials before you. Behave courageously, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will be with the good.&#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-11580a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 19:3">2 Chronicles 19:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>Asherim,</i> Heb. <i>Asheroth</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11583b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 19:6">2 Chronicles 19:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>in the matter of the judgment</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11585c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 19:8">2 Chronicles 19:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'>LXX, Vg. <i>for the inhabitants of Jerusalem</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
