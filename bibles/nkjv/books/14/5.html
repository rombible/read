And he put <i>them</i> in the treasuries of the house of God.</span></p> <h3>
The Ark Brought into the Temple</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Chr-5-2"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Now Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel, in Jerusalem, that they might bring the ark of the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> up from the City of David, which <i>is</i> Zion. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Therefore all the men of Israel assembled with the king at the feast, which <i>was</i> in the seventh month. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So all the elders of Israel came, and the Levites took up the ark. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then they brought up the ark, the tabernacle of meeting, and all the holy furnishings that <i>were</i> in the tabernacle. The priests and the Levites brought them up. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Also King Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel who were assembled with him before the ark, were sacrificing sheep and oxen that could not be counted or numbered for multitude. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> to its place, into the inner sanctuary of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>temple, to the Most Holy <i>Place,</i> under the wings of the cherubim. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For the cherubim spread <i>their</i> wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim overshadowed the ark and its poles. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>The poles extended so that the ends of the poles of the ark could be seen from <i>the holy place,</i> in front of the inner sanctuary; but they could not be seen from outside. And <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>they are there to this day. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Nothing was in the ark except the two tablets which Moses put <i>there</i> at Horeb, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>when the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> made <i>a covenant</i> with the children of Israel, when they had come out of Egypt.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And it came to pass when the priests came out of the <i>Most</i> Holy <i>Place</i> (for all the priests who <i>were</i> present had <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>sanctified themselves, without keeping to their divisions), </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>and the Levites <i>who were</i> the singers, all those of Asaph and Heman and Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren, stood at the east end of the altar, clothed in white linen, having cymbals, stringed instruments and harps, and with them one hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>indeed it came to pass, when the trumpeters and singers <i>were</i> as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, <i>saying:</i></span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text 2Chr-5-13">&#8220;<i>For He is</i> good,</span><br /><span class="text 2Chr-5-13">For His mercy <i>endures</i> forever,&#8221;</span></p></div><p class="first-line-none top-1"><span class="text 2Chr-5-13">that the house, the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, was filled with a cloud, </span>
