<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And it happened in the fifth year of King Rehoboam <i>that</i> Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>with twelve hundred chariots, sixty thousand horsemen, and people without number who came with him out of Egypt&#8212;the Lubim and the Sukkiim and the Ethiopians. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And he took the fortified cities of Judah and came to Jerusalem.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and the leaders of Judah, who were gathered together in Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, &#8220;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8216;You have forsaken Me, and therefore I also have left you in the hand of Shishak.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So the leaders of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, &#8220;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>is</i> righteous.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now when the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came to Shemaiah, saying, &#8220;They have humbled themselves; <i>therefore</i> I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance. My wrath shall not be poured out on Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Nevertheless they will be his servants, that they may distinguish My service from the service of the kingdoms of the nations.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and the treasures of the king&#8217;s house; he took everything. He also carried away the gold shields which Solomon had made. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then King Rehoboam made bronze shields in their place, and committed <i>them</i> to the hands of the captains of the guard, who guarded the doorway of the king&#8217;s house. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And whenever the king entered the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, the guard would go and bring them out; then they would take them back into the guardroom. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>When he humbled himself, the wrath of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> turned from him, so as not to destroy <i>him</i> completely; and things also went well in Judah.</span></p> <h3>
The End of Rehoboam&#8217;s Reign</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Chr-12-13"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Thus King Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem and reigned. Now Rehoboam <i>was</i> forty-one years old when he became king; and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put His name there. His mother&#8217;s name <i>was</i> Naamah, an Ammonitess. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And he did evil, because he did not prepare his heart to seek the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>The acts of Rehoboam, first and last, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies? And <i>there were</i> wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So Rehoboam <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>rested with his fathers, and was buried in the City of David. Then Abijah<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span> his son reigned in his place.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-11454a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 12:16">2 Chronicles 12:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Died and joined his ancestors</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11454b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 12:16">2 Chronicles 12:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Abijam,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="1Kgs.14.31" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=1Kgs.14.31&amp;version=NKJV">1 Kin. 14:31</span></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
