<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then Asa brought silver and gold from the treasuries of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and of the king&#8217;s house, and sent to Ben-Hadad king of Syria, who dwelt in Damascus, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8220;<i>Let there be</i> a treaty between you and me, as there was between my father and your father. See, I have sent you silver and gold; come, break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel, so that he will withdraw from me.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So Ben-Hadad heeded King Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel. They attacked Ijon, Dan, Abel Maim, and all the storage cities of Naphtali. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now it happened, when Baasha heard <i>it,</i> that he stopped building Ramah and ceased his work. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then King Asa took all Judah, and they carried away the stones and timber of Ramah, which Baasha had used for building; and with them he built Geba and Mizpah.</span></p> <h3>
Hanani&#8217;s Message to Asa</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Chr-16-7"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said to him: &#8220;Because you have relied on the king of Syria, and have not relied on the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God, therefore the army of the king of Syria has escaped from your hand. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Were the Ethiopians and the Lubim not a huge army with very many chariots and horsemen? Yet, because you relied on the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, He delivered them into your hand. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For the eyes of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show Himself strong on behalf of <i>those</i> whose heart <i>is</i> loyal to Him. In this you have done foolishly; therefore from now on you shall have wars.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then Asa was angry with the seer, and put him in prison, for <i>he was</i> enraged at him because of this. And Asa oppressed <i>some</i> of the people at that time.</span></p> <h3>
Illness and Death of Asa</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Chr-16-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Note that the acts of Asa, first and last, are indeed written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And in the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa became diseased in his feet, and his malady was severe; yet in his disease he did not seek the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, but the physicians.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So Asa <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>rested with his fathers; he died in the forty-first year of his reign. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>They buried him in his own tomb, which he had <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>made for himself in the City of David; and they laid him in the bed which was filled with spices and various ingredients prepared in a mixture of ointments. They made a very great burning for him.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-11523a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 16:13">2 Chronicles 16:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Died and joined his ancestors</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11524b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 16:14">2 Chronicles 16:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>dug</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
