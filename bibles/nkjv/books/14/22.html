<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Ahaziah <i>was</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>forty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother&#8217;s name <i>was</i> Athaliah the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>granddaughter of Omri. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother advised him to do wickedly. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Therefore he did evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, like the house of Ahab; for they were his counselors after the death of his father, to his destruction. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>He also followed their advice, and went with <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth Gilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then he returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds which he had received at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>Azariah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>His going to Joram was God&#8217;s occasion for Ahaziah&#8217;s <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>downfall; for when he arrived, he went out with <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had anointed to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>cut off the house of Ahab. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And it happened, when Jehu was executing judgment on the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah&#8217;s brothers who served Ahaziah, that he killed them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then he searched for Ahaziah; and they caught him (he was hiding in Samaria), and brought him to Jehu. When they had killed him, they buried him, &#8220;because,&#8221; they said, &#8220;he is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> with all his heart.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Chr-22-9">So the house of Ahaziah had no one to assume power over the kingdom.</span></p> <h3>
Athaliah Reigns in Judah</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Chr-22-10"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal heirs of the house of Judah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king&#8217;s sons who were being murdered, and put him and his nurse in a bedroom. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of King Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest (for she was the sister of Ahaziah), hid him from Athaliah so that she did not kill him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And he was hidden with them in the house of God for six years, while Athaliah reigned over the land.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-11647a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 22:2">2 Chronicles 22:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>twenty-two,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Kgs.8.26" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Kgs.8.26&amp;version=NKJV">2 Kin. 8:26</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11647b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 22:2">2 Chronicles 22:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>daughter</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11650c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 22:5">2 Chronicles 22:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Joram,</i> v. <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Chr.22.7" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Chr.22.7&amp;version=NKJV">7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Kgs.8.28" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Kgs.8.28&amp;version=NKJV">2 Kin. 8:28</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11651d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 22:6">2 Chronicles 22:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. mss., LXX, Syr., Vg. <i>Ahaziah</i> and <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Kgs.8.29" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Kgs.8.29&amp;version=NKJV">2 Kin. 8:29</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11652e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 22:7">2 Chronicles 22:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>crushing</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11652f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 22:7">2 Chronicles 22:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Joram,</i> vv. <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Chr.22.5" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Chr.22.5&amp;version=NKJV">5</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Chr.22.7" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Chr.22.7&amp;version=NKJV">7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Kgs.8.28" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Kgs.8.28&amp;version=NKJV">2 Kin. 8:28</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11652g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 22:7">2 Chronicles 22:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>destroy</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11656h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 22:11">2 Chronicles 22:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Jehosheba,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Kgs.11.2" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Kgs.11.2&amp;version=NKJV">2 Kin. 11:2</span></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
