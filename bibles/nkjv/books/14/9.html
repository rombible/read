<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So Solomon answered all her questions; there was nothing so difficult for Solomon that he could not explain it to her. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>the food on his table, the seating of his servants, the service of his waiters and their apparel, his cupbearers and their apparel, and his entryway by which he went up to the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, there was no more spirit in her.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then she said to the king: &#8220;<i>It was</i> a true report which I heard in my own land about your words and your wisdom. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>However I did not believe their words until I came and saw with my own eyes; and indeed the half of the greatness of your wisdom was not told me. You exceed the fame of which I heard. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Happy <i>are</i> your men and happy <i>are</i> these your servants, who stand continually before you and hear your wisdom! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Blessed be the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God, who delighted in you, setting you on His throne <i>to be</i> king for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God! Because your God has loved Israel, to establish them forever, therefore He made you king over them, to do justice and righteousness.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And she gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold, spices in great abundance, and precious stones; there never were any spices such as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Also, the servants of Hiram and the servants of Solomon, who brought gold from Ophir, brought <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>algum wood and precious stones. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And the king made walkways <i>of</i> the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>algum wood for the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and for the king&#8217;s house, also harps and stringed instruments for singers; and there were none such <i>as these</i> seen before in the land of Judah.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all she desired, whatever she asked, <i>much more</i> than she had brought to the king. So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.</span></p> <h3>
Solomon&#8217;s Great Wealth</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Chr-9-13"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>The weight of gold that came to Solomon yearly was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>besides <i>what</i> the traveling merchants and traders brought. And all the kings of Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold; six hundred <i>shekels</i> of hammered gold went into each shield. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span><i>He</i> also <i>made</i> three hundred shields of hammered gold; <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>three hundred <i>shekels</i> of gold went into each shield. The king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>The throne <i>had</i> six steps, with a footstool of gold, <i>which were</i> fastened to the throne; there were <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>armrests on either side of the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the armrests. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Twelve lions stood there, one on each side of the six steps; nothing like <i>this</i> had been made for any <i>other</i> kingdom.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>All King Solomon&#8217;s drinking vessels <i>were</i> gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon <i>were</i> pure gold. Not <i>one was</i> silver, for this was accounted as nothing in the days of Solomon. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>For the king&#8217;s ships went to Tarshish with the servants of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>Hiram. Once every three years the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>merchant ships came, bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>monkeys.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So King Solomon surpassed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Each man brought his present: articles of silver and gold, garments, armor, spices, horses, and mules, at a set rate year by year.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king at Jerusalem.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>So he reigned over all the kings from <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>the River to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of Egypt. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>The king made silver <i>as common</i> in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedar trees as abundant as the sycamores which <i>are</i> in the lowland. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And they brought horses to Solomon from Egypt and from all lands.</span></p> <h3>
Death of Solomon</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Chr-9-29"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of Nathan the prophet, in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Then Solomon <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>rested with his fathers, and was buried in the City of David his father. And Rehoboam his son reigned in his place.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-11375a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 9:10">2 Chronicles 9:10</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>almug,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="1Kgs.10.11" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=1Kgs.10.11&amp;version=NKJV">1 Kin. 10:11</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="1Kgs.10.12" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=1Kgs.10.12&amp;version=NKJV">12</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11376b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 9:11">2 Chronicles 9:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>almug,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="1Kgs.10.11" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=1Kgs.10.11&amp;version=NKJV">1 Kin. 10:11</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="1Kgs.10.12" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=1Kgs.10.12&amp;version=NKJV">12</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11381c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 9:16">2 Chronicles 9:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>three minas,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="1Kgs.10.17" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=1Kgs.10.17&amp;version=NKJV">1 Kin. 10:17</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11383d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 9:18">2 Chronicles 9:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>hands</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11386e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 9:21">2 Chronicles 9:21</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. <i>Huram;</i> cf. <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="1Kgs.10.22" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=1Kgs.10.22&amp;version=NKJV">1 Kin. 10:22</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11386f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 9:21">2 Chronicles 9:21</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>ships of Tarshish,</i> deep-sea vessels</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11386g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 9:21">2 Chronicles 9:21</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>peacocks</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11391h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 9:26">2 Chronicles 9:26</span> <span class='footnote-text'>The Euphrates</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11396i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 9:31">2 Chronicles 9:31</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Died and joined his ancestors</span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
