Then all the children of Israel returned to their own cities, every man to his possession.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests and the Levites according to their divisions, each man according to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and peace offerings, to serve, to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>camp of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>The king also <i>appointed</i> a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>portion of his possessions<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span> for the burnt offerings: for the morning and evening burnt offerings, the burnt offerings for the Sabbaths and the New Moons and the set feasts, as <i>it is</i> written in the Law of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Moreover he commanded the people who dwelt in Jerusalem to contribute support<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span> for the priests and the Levites, that they might devote themselves to the Law of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>As soon as the commandment was circulated, the children of Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of grain and wine, oil and honey, and of all the produce of the field; and they brought in abundantly the tithe of everything. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And the children of Israel and Judah, who dwelt in the cities of Judah, brought the tithe of oxen and sheep; also the tithe of holy things which were consecrated to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> their God they laid in heaps.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>In the third month they began laying them in heaps, and they finished in the seventh month. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And when Hezekiah and the leaders came and saw the heaps, they blessed the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and His people Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And Azariah the chief priest, from the house of Zadok, answered him and said, &#8220;Since <i>the people</i> began to bring the offerings into the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, we have had enough to eat and have plenty left, for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has blessed His people; and what is left <i>is</i> this great abundance.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now Hezekiah commanded <i>them</i> to prepare rooms<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span> in the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and they prepared them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then they faithfully brought in the offerings, the tithes, and the dedicated things; Cononiah the Levite had charge of them, and Shimei his brother <i>was</i> the next. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah <i>were</i> overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother, at the commandment of Hezekiah the king and Azariah the ruler of the house of God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the keeper of the East Gate, <i>was</i> over the freewill offerings to God, to distribute the offerings of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and the most holy things. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And under him <i>were</i> Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, <i>his</i> faithful assistants in the cities of the priests, to distribute allotments to their brethren by divisions, to the great as well as the small.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Besides those males from three years old and up who were written in the genealogy, they distributed to everyone who entered the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> his daily portion for the work of his service, by his division, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>and to the priests who were written in the genealogy according to their father&#8217;s house, and to the Levites from twenty years old and up according to their work, by their divisions, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>and to all who were written in the genealogy&#8212;their little ones and their wives, their sons and daughters, the whole company of them&#8212;for in their faithfulness they <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>sanctified themselves in holiness.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Also for the sons of Aaron the priests, <i>who were</i> in the fields of the common-lands of their cities, in every single city, <i>there were</i> men who were designated by name to distribute portions to all the males among the priests and to all who were listed by genealogies among the Levites.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Thus Hezekiah did throughout all Judah, and he did what <i>was</i> good and right and true before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> his God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, in the law and in the commandment, to seek his God, he did <i>it</i> with all his heart.
