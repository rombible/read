<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>For the king and his leaders and all the assembly in Jerusalem had agreed to keep the Passover in the second month. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For they could not keep it at <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>the regular time, because a sufficient number of priests had not consecrated themselves, nor had the people gathered together at Jerusalem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And the matter pleased the king and all the assembly. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So they <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>resolved to make a proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba to Dan, that they should come to keep the Passover to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel at Jerusalem, since they had not done <i>it</i> for a long <i>time</i> in the <i>prescribed</i> manner.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then the runners went throughout all Israel and Judah with the letters from the king and his leaders, and spoke according to the command of the king: &#8220;Children of Israel, return to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel; then He will return to the remnant of you who have escaped from the hand of the kings of Assyria. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And do not be like your fathers and your brethren, who trespassed against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of their fathers, so that He gave them up to desolation, as you see. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Now do not be stiff-necked,<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> as your fathers <i>were, but</i> yield yourselves to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; and enter His sanctuary, which He has sanctified forever, and serve the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God, that the fierceness of His wrath may turn away from you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For if you return to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, your brethren and your children <i>will be treated</i> with compassion by those who lead them captive, so that they may come back to this land; for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God <i>is</i> gracious and merciful, and will not turn <i>His</i> face from you if you return to Him.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So the runners passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, as far as Zebulun; but they laughed at them and mocked them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Nevertheless some from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Also the hand of God was on Judah to give them singleness of heart to obey the command of the king and the leaders, at the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Now many people, a very great assembly, gathered at Jerusalem to keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread in the second month. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>They arose and took away the altars that <i>were</i> in Jerusalem, and they took away all the incense altars and cast <i>them</i> into the Brook Kidron. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then they slaughtered the Passover <i>lambs</i> on the fourteenth <i>day</i> of the second month. The priests and the Levites <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>were ashamed, and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>sanctified themselves, and brought the burnt offerings to the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>They stood in their place <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>according to their custom, according to the Law of Moses the man of God; the priests sprinkled the blood <i>received</i> from the hand of the Levites. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>For <i>there were</i> many in the assembly who had not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>sanctified themselves; therefore the Levites had charge of the slaughter of the Passover <i>lambs</i> for everyone <i>who was</i> not clean, to sanctify <i>them</i> to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>For a multitude of the people, many from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet they ate the Passover contrary to what was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, &#8220;May the good <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> provide atonement for everyone </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span><i>who</i> prepares his heart to seek God, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of his fathers, though <i>he is</i> not <i>cleansed</i> according to the purification of the sanctuary.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> listened to Hezekiah and healed the people.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>So the children of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days with great gladness; and the Levites and the priests praised the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> day by day, <i>singing</i> to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, accompanied by loud instruments. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And Hezekiah gave encouragement to all the Levites who taught the good knowledge of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; and they ate throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings and making confession to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of their fathers.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Then the whole assembly agreed to keep <i>the feast</i> another seven days, and they kept it <i>another</i> seven days with gladness. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>For Hezekiah king of Judah gave to the assembly a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep, and the leaders gave to the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep; and a great number of priests sanctified<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span> themselves. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>The whole assembly of Judah rejoiced, also the priests and Levites, all the assembly that came from Israel, the sojourners who came from the land of Israel, and those who dwelt in Judah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>So there was great joy in Jerusalem, for since the time of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel, <i>there had</i> been nothing like this in Jerusalem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Then the priests, the Levites, arose and blessed the people, and their voice was heard; and their prayer came <i>up</i> to His holy dwelling place, to heaven.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-11831a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 30:3">2 Chronicles 30:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>The first month, <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Lev.23.5" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=Lev.23.5&amp;version=NKJV">Lev. 23:5</span>; lit. <i>that time</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11833b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 30:5">2 Chronicles 30:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>established a decree to</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11836c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 30:8">2 Chronicles 30:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Rebellious</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11843d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 30:15">2 Chronicles 30:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>humbled themselves</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11843e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 30:15">2 Chronicles 30:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>set themselves apart</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11844f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 30:16">2 Chronicles 30:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>in their proper order</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11845g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 30:17">2 Chronicles 30:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>consecrated</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-11852h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Chronicles 30:24">2 Chronicles 30:24</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>consecrated</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
