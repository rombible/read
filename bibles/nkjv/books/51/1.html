<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ <i>who are</i> in Colosse:</span></p><p class="top-1"><span class="text Col-1-2">Grace to you and peace from God our Father <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p> <h3>
Their Faith in Christ</span></h3><p><span class="text Col-1-3"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>We give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of your love for all the saints; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>because of the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, of which you heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>which has come to you, as <i>it has</i> also in all the world, and is bringing forth <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>fruit, as <i>it is</i> also among you since the day you heard and knew the grace of God in truth; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>as you also learned from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on your behalf, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>who also declared to us your love in the Spirit.</span></p> <h3>
Preeminence of Christ</span></h3><p><span class="text Col-1-9"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For this reason we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>that you may walk worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing <i>Him,</i> being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>strengthened with all might, according to His glorious power, for all patience and longsuffering with joy; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>giving thanks to the Father who has qualified us to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in the light. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>He has delivered us from the power of darkness and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>conveyed <i>us</i> into the kingdom of the Son of His love, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>in whom we have redemption <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>through His blood, the forgiveness of sins.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>For by Him all things were created that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>principalities or <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>powers. All things were created through Him and for Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And He is before all things, and in Him all things consist. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And He is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things He may have the preeminence.</span></p> <h3>
Reconciled in Christ</span></h3><p><span class="text Col-1-19"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>For it pleased <i>the Father that</i> in Him all the fullness should dwell, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>and by Him to reconcile all things to Himself, by Him, whether things on earth or things in heaven, having made peace through the blood of His cross.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And you, who once were alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now He has reconciled </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>in the body of His flesh through death, to present you holy, and blameless, and above reproach in His sight&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>if indeed you continue in the faith, grounded and steadfast, and are not moved away from the hope of the gospel which you heard, which was preached to every creature under heaven, of which I, Paul, became a minister.</span></p> <h3>
Sacrificial Service for Christ</span></h3><p><span class="text Col-1-24"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>I now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up in my flesh what is lacking in the afflictions of Christ, for the sake of His body, which is the church, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>of which I became a minister according to the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>stewardship from God which was given to me for you, to fulfill the word of God, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>mystery which has been hidden from ages and from generations, but now has been revealed to His saints. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>To them God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles: <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Him we preach, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus. </span>
