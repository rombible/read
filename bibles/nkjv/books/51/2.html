<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>that their hearts may be encouraged, being knit together in love, and <i>attaining</i> to all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the knowledge of the mystery of God, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>both of the Father and of Christ, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Now this I say lest anyone should deceive you with persuasive words. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For though I am absent in the flesh, yet I am with you in spirit, rejoicing <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>to see your <i>good</i> order and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>As you therefore have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in Him, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>rooted and built up in Him and established in the faith, as you have been taught, abounding <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>in it with thanksgiving.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Beware lest anyone <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>cheat you through philosophy and empty deceit, according to the tradition of men, according to the basic principles of the world, and not according to Christ. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>bodily; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and you are complete in Him, who is the head of all <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>principality and power.</span></p> <h3>
Not Legalism but Christ</span></h3><p><span class="text Col-2-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>In Him you were also circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>of the sins of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>buried with Him in baptism, in which you also were raised with <i>Him</i> through faith in the working of God, who raised Him from the dead. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And you, being dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, He has made alive together with Him, having forgiven you all trespasses, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>having wiped out the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>handwriting of requirements that was against us, which was contrary to us. And He has taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Having disarmed principalities and powers, He made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them in it.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So let no one judge you in food or in drink, or regarding a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>festival or a new moon or sabbaths, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>which are a shadow of things to come, but the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span>substance is of Christ. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/2-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Let no one cheat you of your reward, taking delight in <i>false</i> humility and worship of angels, intruding into those things which he has <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[l]</a></span>not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/2-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>and not holding fast to the Head, from whom all the body, nourished and knit together by joints and ligaments, grows with the increase <i>that is</i> from God.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/2-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[m]</a></span>Therefore, if you died with Christ from the basic principles of the world, why, as <i>though</i> living in the world, do you subject yourselves to regulations&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/2-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>&#8220;Do not touch, do not taste, do not handle,&#8221; </span>
