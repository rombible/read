<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Set your mind on things above, not on things on the earth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>When Christ <i>who is</i> our life appears, then you also will appear with Him in glory.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Therefore put to death your members which are on the earth: fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Because of these things the wrath of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>in which you yourselves once walked when you lived in them.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But now you yourselves are to put off all these: anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy language out of your mouth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Do not lie to one another, since you have put off the old man with his deeds, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and have put on the new <i>man</i> who is renewed in knowledge according to the image of Him who created him, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcised nor uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave <i>nor</i> free, but Christ <i>is</i> all and in all.</span></p> <h3>
Character of the New Man</span></h3><p><span class="text Col-3-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Therefore, as <i>the</i> elect of God, holy and beloved, put on tender mercies, kindness, humility, meekness, longsuffering; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>bearing with one another, and forgiving one another, if anyone has a complaint against another; even as Christ forgave you, so you also <i>must do.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But above all these things put on love, which is the bond of perfection. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which also you were called in one body; and be thankful. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/3-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And whatever you do in word or deed, <i>do</i> all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him.</span></p> <h3>
