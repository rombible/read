And His disciples plucked the heads of grain and ate <i>them,</i> rubbing <i>them</i> in <i>their</i> hands. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And some of the Pharisees said to them, &#8220;Why are you doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But Jesus answering them said, <span class="woj">&#8220;Have you not even read this,</span> <span class="woj">what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him:</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/6-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span><span class="woj">how he went into the house of God, took and ate the showbread, and also gave some to those with him,</span> <span class="woj">which is not lawful for any but the priests to eat?&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/6-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;The Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Healing on the Sabbath</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-6-6"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now it happened on another Sabbath, also, that He entered the synagogue and taught. And a man was there whose right hand was withered. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So the scribes and Pharisees watched Him closely, whether He would heal on the Sabbath, that they might find an accusation against Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But He knew their thoughts, and said to the man who had the withered hand, <span class="woj">&#8220;Arise and stand here.&#8221;</span> And he arose and stood. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then Jesus said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;I will ask you one thing:</span> <span class="woj">Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span><span class="woj">to destroy?&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/6-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And when He had looked around at them all, He said to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>the man, <span class="woj">&#8220;Stretch out your hand.&#8221;</span> And he did so, and his hand was restored <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>as whole as the other. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/6-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But they were filled with rage, and discussed with one another what they might do to Jesus.</span></p> <h3>
The Twelve Apostles</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-6-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/6-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now it came to pass in those days that He went out to the mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/6-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And when it was day, He called His disciples to <i>Himself;</i> and from them He chose twelve whom He also named apostles: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/6-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Simon, whom He also named Peter, and Andrew his brother; James and John; Philip and Bartholomew; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/6-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Matthew and Thomas; James the <i>son</i> of Alphaeus, and Simon called the Zealot; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/6-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Judas <i>the son</i> of James, and Judas Iscariot who also became a traitor.</span></p> <h3>
Jesus Heals a Great Multitude</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-6-17"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/6-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And He came down with them and stood on a level place with a crowd of His disciples and a great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and from the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear Him and be healed of their diseases, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/6-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>as well as those who were tormented with unclean spirits. And they were healed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/6-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And the whole multitude sought to touch Him, for power went out from Him and healed <i>them</i> all.</span></p> <h3>
