<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Now behold, <i>there was</i> a man named Zacchaeus who was a chief tax collector, and he was rich. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And he sought to see who Jesus was, but could not because of the crowd, for he was of short stature. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So he ran ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see Him, for He was going to pass that <i>way.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And when Jesus came to the place, He looked up <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>and saw him, and said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;Zacchaeus,</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span><span class="woj">make haste and come down, for today I must stay at your house.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So he <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>made haste and came down, and received Him joyfully. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But when they saw <i>it,</i> they all <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>complained, saying, &#8220;He has gone to be a guest with a man who is a sinner.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, &#8220;Look, Lord, I give half of my goods to the poor; and if I have taken anything from anyone by false accusation, I restore fourfold.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And Jesus said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;Today salvation has come to this house, because</span> <span class="woj">he also is</span> <span class="woj">a son of Abraham;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><span class="woj">for the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
The Parable of the Minas</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-19-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now as they heard these things, He spoke another parable, because He was near Jerusalem and because they thought the kingdom of God would appear immediately. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Therefore He said: <span class="woj">&#8220;A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span><span class="woj">So he called ten of his servants, delivered to them ten</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span><span class="woj">minas, and said to them, &#8216;Do business till I come.&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span><span class="woj">But his citizens hated him, and sent a delegation after him, saying, &#8216;We will not have this <i>man</i> to reign over us.&#8217;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;And so it was that when he returned, having received the kingdom, he then commanded these servants, to whom he had given the money, to be called to him, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span><span class="woj">Then came the first, saying, &#8216;Master, your mina has earned ten minas.&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span><span class="woj">And he said to him,</span> <span class="woj">&#8216;Well <i>done,</i> good servant; because you were</span> <span class="woj">faithful in a very little, have authority over ten cities.&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span><span class="woj">And the second came, saying, &#8216;Master, your mina has earned five minas.&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span><span class="woj">Likewise he said to him, &#8216;You also be over five cities.&#8217;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;Then another came, saying, &#8216;Master, here is your mina, which I have kept put away in a handkerchief.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span><span class="woj">For I feared you, because you are</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span><span class="woj">an austere man. You collect what you did not deposit, and reap what you did not sow.&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span><span class="woj">And he said to him,</span> <span class="woj">&#8216;Out of your own mouth I will judge you, <i>you</i> wicked servant.</span> <span class="woj">You knew that I was an austere man, collecting what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span><span class="woj">Why then did you not put my money in the bank, that at my coming I might have collected it with interest?&#8217;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;And he said to those who stood by, &#8216;Take the mina from him, and give <i>it</i> to him who has ten minas.&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span><span class="woj">(But they said to him, &#8216;Master, he has ten minas.&#8217;)</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8216;For I say to you,</span> <span class="woj">that to everyone who has will be given; and from him who does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span><span class="woj">But bring here those enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, and slay <i>them</i> before me.&#8217; &#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
The Triumphal Entry</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-19-28"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>When He had said this, He went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And it came to pass, when He drew near to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>Bethphage and Bethany, at the mountain called Olivet, <i>that</i> He sent two of His disciples, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>saying, <span class="woj">&#8220;Go into the village opposite <i>you,</i> where as you enter you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever sat. Loose it and bring <i>it here.</i></span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span><span class="woj">And if anyone asks you, &#8216;Why are you loosing <i>it?</i>&#8217; thus you shall say to him, &#8216;Because the Lord has need of it.&#8217; &#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>So those who were sent went their way and found <i>it</i> just as He had said to them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>But as they were loosing the colt, the owners of it said to them, &#8220;Why are you loosing the colt?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>And they said, &#8220;The Lord has need of him.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Then they brought him to Jesus. And they threw their own clothes on the colt, and they set Jesus on him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>And as He went, <i>many</i> spread their clothes on the road.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>Then, as He was now drawing near the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works they had seen, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>saying:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Luke-19-38">&#8220; <span class="oblique">&#8216;Blessed</span> <i>is</i> <span class="oblique">the King who comes in the name of the</span> <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span><span class="oblique">!&#8217;</span></span><br /><span class="text Luke-19-38">Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!&#8221;</span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>And some of the Pharisees called to Him from the crowd, &#8220;Teacher, rebuke Your disciples.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>But He answered and said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;I tell you that if these should keep silent,</span> <span class="woj">the stones would immediately cry out.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Jesus Weeps over Jerusalem</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-19-41"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>Now as He drew near, He saw the city and wept over it, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>saying, <span class="woj">&#8220;If you had known, even you, especially in this</span> <span class="woj">your day, the things <i>that</i></span> <span class="woj"><i>make</i> for your</span> <span class="woj">peace!

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span><span class="woj">For days will come upon you when your enemies will</span> <span class="woj">build an embankment around you, surround you and close you in on every side,</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span><span class="woj">and level you, and your children within you, to the ground; and</span> <span class="woj">they will not leave in you one stone upon another,</span> <span class="woj">because you did not know the time of your visitation.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Jesus Cleanses the Temple</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-19-45"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>Then He went into the temple and began to drive out those who <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>bought and sold in it, </span>
