<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and saw two boats standing by the lake; but the fishermen had gone from them and were washing <i>their</i> nets. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then He got into one of the boats, which was Simon&#8217;s, and asked him to put out a little from the land. And He sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>When He had stopped speaking, He said to Simon, <span class="woj">&#8220;Launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But Simon answered and said to Him, &#8220;Master, we have toiled all night and caught nothing; nevertheless at Your word I will let down the net.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And when they had done this, they caught a great number of fish, and their net was breaking. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So they signaled to <i>their</i> partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>When Simon Peter saw <i>it,</i> he fell down at Jesus&#8217; knees, saying, &#8220;Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For he and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish which they had taken; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and so also <i>were</i> James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, <span class="woj">&#8220;Do not be afraid.</span> <span class="woj">From now on you will catch men.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So when they had brought their boats to land, they <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>forsook all and followed Him.</span></p> <h3>
Jesus Cleanses a Leper</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-5-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And it happened when He was in a certain city, that behold, a man who was full of leprosy saw Jesus; and he fell on <i>his</i> face and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>implored Him, saying, &#8220;Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then He put out <i>His</i> hand and touched him, saying, <span class="woj">&#8220;I am willing; be cleansed.&#8221;</span> Immediately the leprosy left him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And He charged him to tell no one, <span class="woj">&#8220;But go and show yourself to the priest, and make an offering for your cleansing, as a testimony to them,</span> <span class="woj">just as Moses commanded.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>However, the report went around concerning Him all the more; and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by Him of their infirmities. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So He Himself <i>often</i> withdrew into the wilderness and prayed.</span></p> <h3>
Jesus Forgives and Heals a Paralytic</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-5-17"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Now it happened on a certain day, as He was teaching, that there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by, who had come out of every town of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was <i>present</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>to heal them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then behold, men brought on a bed a man who was paralyzed, whom they sought to bring in and lay before Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And when they could not find how they might bring him in, because of the crowd, they went up on the housetop and let him down with <i>his</i> bed through the tiling into the midst before Jesus.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>When He saw their faith, He said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;Man, your sins are forgiven you.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, &#8220;Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, He answered and said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Why are you reasoning in your hearts?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span><span class="woj">Which is easier, to say, &#8216;Your sins are forgiven you,&#8217; or to say, &#8216;Rise up and walk&#8217;?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span><span class="woj">But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins&#8221;</span>&#8212;He said to the man who was paralyzed, <span class="woj">&#8220;I say to you, arise, take up your bed, and go to your house.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Immediately he rose up before them, took up what he had been lying on, and departed to his own house, glorifying God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And they were all amazed, and they glorified God and were filled with fear, saying, &#8220;We have seen strange things today!&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Matthew the Tax Collector</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-5-27"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>After these things He went out and saw a tax collector named Levi, sitting at the tax office. And He said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;Follow Me.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>So he left all, rose up, and followed Him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Then Levi gave Him a great feast in his own house. And there were a great number of tax collectors and others who sat down with them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>And their scribes and the Pharisees <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>complained against His disciples, saying, &#8220;Why do You eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Jesus answered and said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span><span class="woj">I have not come to call <i>the</i> righteous, but sinners, to repentance.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Jesus Is Questioned About Fasting</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-5-33"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Then they said to Him, &#8220;Why<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span> do the disciples of John fast often and make prayers, and likewise those of the Pharisees, but Yours eat and drink?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>And He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast while the</span> <span class="woj">bridegroom is with them?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span><span class="woj">But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them; then they will fast in those days.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Then He spoke a parable to them: <span class="woj">&#8220;No one</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span><span class="woj">puts a piece from a new garment on an old one; otherwise the new makes a tear, and also the piece that was <i>taken</i> out of the new does not match the old.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span><span class="woj">And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; or else the new wine will burst the wineskins and be spilled, and the wineskins will be ruined.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span><span class="woj">But new wine must be put into new wineskins,</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span><span class="woj">and both are preserved.</span> </span>
