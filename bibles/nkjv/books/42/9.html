<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>He sent them to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Take nothing for the journey, neither staffs nor bag nor bread nor money; and do not have two tunics apiece.</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;Whatever house you enter, stay there, and from there depart.</span> </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So they departed and went through the towns, preaching the gospel and healing everywhere.</span></p> <h3>
Herod Seeks to See Jesus</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-9-7"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by Him; and he was perplexed, because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>and by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the old prophets had risen again. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Herod said, &#8220;John I have beheaded, but who is this of whom I hear such things?&#8221; So he sought to see Him.</span></p> <h3>
Feeding the Five Thousand</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-9-10"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And the apostles, when they had returned, told Him all that they had done. Then He took them and went aside privately into a deserted place belonging to the city called Bethsaida. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But when the multitudes knew <i>it,</i> they followed Him; and He received them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who had need of healing. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>When the day began to wear away, the twelve came and said to Him, &#8220;Send the multitude away, that they may go into the surrounding towns and country, and lodge and get provisions; for we are in a deserted place here.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>But He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;You give them something to eat.&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span class="text Luke-9-13">And they said, &#8220;We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we go and buy food for all these people.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For there were about five thousand men.</span></p><p><span class="text Luke-9-14">Then He said to His disciples, <span class="woj">&#8220;Make them sit down in groups of fifty.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And they did so, and made them all sit down.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He blessed and broke them, and gave <i>them</i> to the disciples to set before the multitude. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So they all ate and were <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>filled, and twelve baskets of the leftover fragments were taken up by them.</span></p> <h3>
Peter Confesses Jesus as the Christ</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-9-18"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And it happened, as He was alone praying, <i>that</i> His disciples joined Him, and He asked them, saying, <span class="woj">&#8220;Who do the crowds say that I am?&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>So they answered and said, &#8220;John the Baptist, but some <i>say</i> Elijah; and others <i>say</i> that one of the old prophets has risen again.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;But who do you say that I am?&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span class="text Luke-9-20">Peter answered and said, &#8220;The Christ of God.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Jesus Predicts His Death and Resurrection</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-9-21"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And He strictly warned and commanded them to tell this to no one, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>saying, <span class="woj">&#8220;The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised the third day.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Take Up the Cross and Follow Him</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-9-23"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Then He said to <i>them</i> all, <span class="woj">&#8220;If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span><span class="woj">daily, and follow Me.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span><span class="woj">For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will save it.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span><span class="woj">For what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world, and is himself destroyed or lost?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span><span class="woj">For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words, of him the Son of Man will be</span> <span class="woj">ashamed when He comes in His <i>own</i> glory, and <i>in His</i> Father&#8217;s, and of the holy angels.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span><span class="woj">But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who shall not taste death till they see the kingdom of God.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Jesus Transfigured on the Mount</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-9-28"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Now it came to pass, about eight days after these sayings, that He took Peter, John, and James and went up on the mountain to pray. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>As He prayed, the appearance of His face was altered, and His robe <i>became</i> white <i>and</i> glistening. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And behold, two men talked with Him, who were Moses and Elijah, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>who appeared in glory and spoke of His <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>decease which He was about to accomplish at Jerusalem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>But Peter and those with him were heavy with sleep; and when they were fully awake, they saw His glory and the two men who stood with Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Then it happened, as they were parting from Him, <i>that</i> Peter said to Jesus, &#8220;Master, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>tabernacles: one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah&#8221;&#8212;not knowing what he said.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>While he was saying this, a cloud came and overshadowed them; and they were fearful as they entered the cloud. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, &#8220;This is <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>My beloved Son. Hear Him!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>When the voice had ceased, Jesus was found alone. But they kept quiet, and told no one in those days any of the things they had seen.</span></p> <h3>
A Boy Is Healed</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-9-37"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>Now it happened on the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, that a great multitude met Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>Suddenly a man from the multitude cried out, saying, &#8220;Teacher, I implore You, look on my son, for he is my only child. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>And behold, a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly cries out; it convulses him so that he foams <i>at the mouth;</i> and it departs from him with great difficulty, bruising him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>So I implored Your disciples to cast it out, but they could not.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>Then Jesus answered and said, <span class="woj">&#8220;O</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span><span class="woj">faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span><span class="woj">bear with you?

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>And as he was still coming, the demon threw him down and convulsed <i>him.</i> Then Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the child, and gave him back to his father.</span></p> <h3>
Jesus Again Predicts His Death</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-9-43"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>And they were all amazed at the majesty of God.</span></p><p><span class="text Luke-9-43">But while everyone marveled at all the things which Jesus did, He said to His disciples, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;Let these words sink down into your ears, for the Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>But they did not understand this saying, and it was hidden from them so that they did not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask Him about this saying.</span></p> <h3>
Who Is the Greatest?</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-9-46"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span>Then a dispute arose among them as to which of them would be greatest. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-47.htm"><b>47</b></a></span>And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a little child and set him by Him, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-48.htm"><b>48</b></a></span>and said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Whoever receives this little child in My name receives Me; and</span> <span class="woj">whoever receives Me</span> <span class="woj">receives Him who sent Me.</span> <span class="woj">For he who is least among you all will be great.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Jesus Forbids Sectarianism</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-9-49"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-49.htm"><b>49</b></a></span>Now John answered and said, &#8220;Master, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name, and we forbade him because he does not follow with us.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-50.htm"><b>50</b></a></span>But Jesus said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;Do not forbid <i>him,</i> for</span> <span class="woj">he who is not against</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span><span class="woj">us is on</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span><span class="woj">our side.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-53.htm"><b>53</b></a></span>But they did not receive Him, because His face was <i>set</i> for the journey to Jerusalem. </span>
