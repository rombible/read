<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>infirmities&#8212;Mary called Magdalene, out of whom had come seven demons, </span>

The Parable of the Sower</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-8-4"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And when a great multitude had gathered, and they had come to Him from every city, He spoke by a parable: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;A sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some fell by the wayside; and it was trampled down, and the birds of the air devoured it.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span><span class="woj">Some fell on rock; and as soon as it sprang up, it withered away because it lacked moisture.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span><span class="woj">And some fell among thorns, and the thorns sprang up with it and choked it.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><span class="woj">But others fell on good ground, sprang up, and yielded</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span><span class="woj">a crop a hundredfold.&#8221;</span> When He had said these things He cried, <span class="woj">&#8220;He who has ears to hear, let him hear!&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
The Purpose of Parables</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-8-9"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then His disciples asked Him, saying, &#8220;What does this parable mean?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And He said, <span class="woj">&#8220;To you it has been given to know the</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span><span class="woj">mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest <i>it is given</i> in parables, that</span></span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Luke-8-10"><span class="woj">&#8216;Seeing they may not see,</span></span><br /><span class="text Luke-8-10"><span class="woj">And hearing they may not understand.&#8217;</span></span></p></div> <h3>
The Parable of the Sower Explained</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-8-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;Now the parable is this: The seed is the</span> <span class="woj">word of God.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span><span class="woj">Those by the wayside are the ones who hear; then the devil comes and takes away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span><span class="woj">But the ones on the rock <i>are those</i> who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, who believe for a while and in time of</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span><span class="woj">temptation fall away.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span><span class="woj">Now the ones <i>that</i> fell among thorns are those who, when they have heard, go out and are choked with cares,</span> <span class="woj">riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to maturity.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span><span class="woj">But the ones <i>that</i> fell on the good ground are those who, having heard the word with a noble and good heart, keep <i>it</i> and bear fruit with</span> <span class="woj">patience.</span><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span></span></p> <h3>
The Parable of the Revealed Light</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-8-16"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;No one, when he has lit a lamp, covers it with a vessel or puts <i>it</i> under a bed, but sets <i>it</i> on a lampstand, that those who enter may see the</span> <span class="woj">light.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span><span class="woj">For nothing is secret that will not be</span> <span class="woj">revealed, nor <i>anything</i> hidden that will not be known and come to light.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span><span class="woj">Therefore take heed how you hear.</span> <span class="woj">For whoever has, to him <i>more</i> will be given; and whoever does not have, even what he</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span><span class="woj">seems to</span> <span class="woj">have will be taken from him.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Jesus&#8217; Mother and Brothers Come to Him</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-8-19"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then His mother and brothers came to Him, and could not approach Him because of the crowd. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And it was told Him <i>by some,</i> who said, &#8220;Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, desiring to see You.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>But He answered and said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;My mother and My brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Wind and Wave Obey Jesus</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-8-22"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Now it happened, on a certain day, that He got into a boat with His disciples. And He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Let us cross over to the other side of the lake.&#8221;</span> And they launched out. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>But as they sailed He fell asleep. And a windstorm came down on the lake, and they were filling <i>with water,</i> and were in <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>jeopardy. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And they came to Him and awoke Him, saying, &#8220;Master, Master, we are perishing!&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Luke-8-24">Then He arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water. And they ceased, and there was a calm. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>But He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Where is your faith?&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span class="text Luke-8-25">And they were afraid, and marveled, saying to one another, &#8220;Who can this be?

A Demon-Possessed Man Healed</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-8-26"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Then they sailed to the country of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span>Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And when He stepped out on the land, there met Him a certain man from the city who had demons <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[l]</a></span>for a long time. And he wore no clothes, nor did he live in a house but in the tombs. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>When he saw Jesus, he cried out, fell down before Him, and with a loud voice said, &#8220;What have I to do with You, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg You, do not torment me!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>For He had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For it had often seized him, and he was kept under guard, bound with chains and shackles; and he broke the bonds and was driven by the demon into the wilderness.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Jesus asked him, saying, <span class="woj">&#8220;What is your name?&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span class="text Luke-8-30">And he said, &#8220;Legion,&#8221; because many demons had entered him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>And they begged Him that He would not command them to go out into the abyss.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Now a herd of many swine was feeding there on the mountain. So they begged Him that He would permit them to enter them. And He permitted them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Then the demons went out of the man and entered the swine, and the herd ran violently down the steep place into the lake and drowned.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>When those who fed <i>them</i> saw what had happened, they fled and told <i>it</i> in the city and in the country. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Then they went out to see what had happened, and came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind. And they were afraid. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>They also who had seen <i>it</i> told them by what means he who had been demon-possessed was <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[m]</a></span>healed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>Then the whole multitude of the surrounding region of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[n]</a></span>Gadarenes asked Him to depart from them, for they were seized with great fear. And He got into the boat and returned.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>Now the man from whom the demons had departed begged Him that he might be with Him. But Jesus sent him away, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;Return to your own house, and tell what great things God has done for you.&#8221;</span> And he went his way and proclaimed throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him.</span></p> <h3>
A Girl Restored to Life and a Woman Healed</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-8-40"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>So it was, when Jesus returned, that the multitude welcomed Him, for they were all waiting for Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>And behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue. And he fell down at Jesus&#8217; feet and begged Him to come to his house, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>for he had an only daughter about twelve years of age, and she was dying.</span></p><p><span class="text Luke-8-42">But as He went, the multitudes thronged Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>Now a woman, having a flow of blood for twelve years, who had spent all her livelihood on physicians and could not be healed by any, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>came from behind and touched the border of His garment. And immediately her flow of blood stopped.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>And Jesus said, <span class="woj">&#8220;Who touched Me?&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span class="text Luke-8-45">When all denied it, Peter <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[o]</a></span>and those with him said, &#8220;Master, the multitudes throng and press You, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[p]</a></span>and You say, <span class="woj">&#8216;Who touched Me?&#8217;</span> &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span>But Jesus said, <span class="woj">&#8220;Somebody touched Me, for I perceived</span> <span class="woj">power going out from Me.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-47.htm"><b>47</b></a></span>Now when the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling; and falling down before Him, she declared to Him in the presence of all the people the reason she had touched Him and how she was healed immediately.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-48.htm"><b>48</b></a></span>And He said to her, <span class="woj">&#8220;Daughter,</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[q]</a></span><span class="woj">be of good cheer;</span> <span class="woj">your faith has made you well.</span> <span class="woj">Go in peace.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-49.htm"><b>49</b></a></span>While He was still speaking, someone came from the ruler of the synagogue&#8217;s <i>house,</i> saying to him, &#8220;Your daughter is dead.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-50.htm"><b>50</b></a></span>But when Jesus heard <i>it,</i> He answered him, saying, <span class="woj">&#8220;Do not be afraid;</span> <span class="woj">only believe, and she will be made well.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-51.htm"><b>51</b></a></span>When He came into the house, He permitted no one to go <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[s]</a></span>in except <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[t]</a></span>Peter, James, and John, and the father and mother of the girl. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-52.htm"><b>52</b></a></span>Now all wept and mourned for her; but He said, <span class="woj">&#8220;Do not weep; she is not dead,</span> <span class="woj">but sleeping.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-53.htm"><b>53</b></a></span>And they ridiculed Him, knowing that she was dead.</span></p> <p>
