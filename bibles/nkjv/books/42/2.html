<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>This census first took place while Quirinius was governing Syria. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So all went to be registered, everyone to his own city.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>to be registered with Mary, his betrothed <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>wife, who was with child. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So it was, that while they were there, the days were completed for her to be delivered. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And she brought forth her firstborn Son, and wrapped Him in swaddling cloths, and laid Him in a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.</span></p> <h3>
Glory in the Highest</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-2-8"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Now there were in the same country shepherds living out in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>behold, an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were greatly afraid. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then the angel said to them, &#8220;Do not be afraid, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which will be to all people. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For there is born to you this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And this <i>will be</i> the sign to you: You will find a Babe wrapped in swaddling cloths, lying in a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>manger.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying:</span></p> <div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>&#8220;Glory to God in the highest,</span><br /><span class="text Luke-2-14">And on earth peace, goodwill<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span> toward men!&#8221;</span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So it was, when the angels had gone away from them into heaven, that the shepherds said to one another, &#8220;Let us now go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has come to pass, which the Lord has made known to us.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the Babe lying in a manger. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Now when they had seen <i>Him,</i> they made <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>widely known the saying which was told them concerning this Child. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And all those who heard <i>it</i> marveled at those things which were told them by the shepherds. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>But Mary kept all these things and pondered <i>them</i> in her heart. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told them.</span></p> <h3>
Circumcision of Jesus</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-2-21"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And when eight days were completed <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>for the circumcision of the Child, His name was called <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Jesus</span>, the name given by the angel before He was conceived in the womb.</span></p> <h3>
Jesus Presented in the Temple</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-2-22"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Now when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were completed, they brought Him to Jerusalem to present <i>Him</i> to the Lord </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>(as it is written in the law of the Lord, <span class="oblique">&#8220;Every male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the</span> <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span><span class="oblique">&#8221;</span>), </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the law of the Lord, <span class="oblique">&#8220;A pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Simeon Sees God&#8217;s Salvation</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-2-25"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name <i>was</i> Simeon, and this man <i>was</i> just and devout, waiting for the Consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord&#8217;s Christ. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>So he came by the Spirit into the temple. And when the parents brought in the Child Jesus, to do for Him according to the custom of the law, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>he took Him up in his arms and blessed God and said:</span></p> <div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line">

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>A light to <i>bring</i> revelation to the Gentiles,</span><br /><span class="text Luke-2-32">And the glory of Your people Israel.&#8221;</span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>And Joseph and His mother marveled at those things which were spoken of Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Then Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary His mother, &#8220;Behold, this <i>Child</i> is destined for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign which will be spoken against </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>(yes, a sword will pierce through your own soul also), that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Anna Bears Witness to the Redeemer</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-2-36"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Now there was one, Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>and this woman <i>was</i> a widow <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>of about eighty-four years, who did not depart from the temple, but served <i>God</i> with fastings and prayers night and day. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>And coming in that instant she gave thanks to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>the Lord, and spoke of Him to all those who looked for redemption in Jerusalem.</span></p> <h3>
The Family Returns to Nazareth</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-2-39"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>So when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their <i>own</i> city, Nazareth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>And the Child grew and became strong <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span>in spirit, filled with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon Him.</span></p> <h3>
The Boy Jesus Amazes the Scholars</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-2-41"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>His parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>And when He was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>When they had finished the days, as they returned, the Boy Jesus lingered behind in Jerusalem. And <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[l]</a></span>Joseph and His mother did not know <i>it;</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>but supposing Him to have been in the company, they went a day&#8217;s journey, and sought Him among <i>their</i> relatives and acquaintances. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>So when they did not find Him, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span>Now so it was <i>that</i> after three days they found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both listening to them and asking them questions. </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-48.htm"><b>48</b></a></span>So when they saw Him, they were amazed; and His mother said to Him, &#8220;Son, why have You done this to us? Look, Your father and I have sought You anxiously.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-49.htm"><b>49</b></a></span>And He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Why did you seek Me? Did you not know that I must be</span> <span class="woj">about</span> <span class="woj">My Father&#8217;s business?&#8221;</span> </span>
