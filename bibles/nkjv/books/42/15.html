<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And the Pharisees and scribes complained, saying, &#8220;This Man <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>receives sinners and eats with them.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So He spoke this parable to them, saying:</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;What man of you, having a hundred sheep, if he loses one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after the one which is lost until he finds it?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span><span class="woj">And when he has found <i>it,</i> he lays <i>it</i> on his shoulders, rejoicing.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span><span class="woj">And when he comes home, he calls together <i>his</i> friends and neighbors, saying to them,</span> <span class="woj">&#8216;Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep</span> <span class="woj">which was lost!&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span><span class="woj">I say to you that likewise there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents</span> <span class="woj">than over ninety-nine</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span><span class="woj">just persons who</span> <span class="woj">need no repentance.</span></span></p> <h3>
The Parable of the Lost Coin</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-15-8"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;Or what woman, having ten silver</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span><span class="woj">coins, if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp, sweep the house, and search carefully until she finds <i>it?</i></span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span><span class="woj">And when she has found <i>it,</i> she calls <i>her</i> friends and neighbors together, saying, &#8216;Rejoice with me, for I have found the piece which I lost!&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><span class="woj">Likewise, I say to you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
The Parable of the Lost Son</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-15-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then He said: <span class="woj">&#8220;A certain man had two sons.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span><span class="woj">And the younger of them said to <i>his</i> father, &#8216;Father, give me the portion of goods that falls <i>to me.</i>&#8217; So he divided to them</span> <span class="woj"><i>his</i> livelihood.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span><span class="woj">And not many days after, the younger son gathered all together, journeyed to a far country, and there wasted his possessions with</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span><span class="woj">prodigal living.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span><span class="woj">But when he had spent all, there arose a severe famine in that land, and he began to be in want.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span><span class="woj">Then he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span><span class="woj">And he would gladly have filled his stomach with the</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span><span class="woj">pods that the swine ate, and no one gave him <i>anything.</i></span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;But when he came to himself, he said, &#8216;How many of my father&#8217;s hired servants have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span><span class="woj">I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, &#8220;Father,</span> <span class="woj">I have sinned against heaven and before you,</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span><span class="woj">and I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired servants.&#8221; &#8217;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;And he arose and came to his father. But</span> <span class="woj">when he was still a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span><span class="woj">And the son said to him, &#8216;Father, I have sinned against heaven</span> <span class="woj">and in your sight, and am no longer worthy to be called your son.&#8217;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;But the father said to his servants,</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span><span class="woj">&#8216;Bring out the best robe and put <i>it</i> on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on <i>his</i> feet.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span><span class="woj">And bring the fatted calf here and kill <i>it,</i> and let us eat and be merry;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span><span class="woj">for this my son was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.&#8217; And they began to be merry.</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;Now his older son was in the field. And as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span><span class="woj">So he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span><span class="woj">And he said to him, &#8216;Your brother has come, and because he has received him safe and sound, your father has killed the fatted calf.&#8217;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;But he was angry and would not go in. Therefore his father came out and pleaded with him.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span><span class="woj">So he answered and said to <i>his</i> father, &#8216;Lo, these many years I have been serving you; I never transgressed your commandment at any time; and yet you never gave me a young goat, that I might make merry with my friends.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span><span class="woj">But as soon as this son of yours came, who has devoured your livelihood with harlots, you killed the fatted calf for him.&#8217;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;And he said to him, &#8216;Son, you are always with me, and all that I have is yours.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span><span class="woj">It was right that we should make merry and be glad,</span> <span class="woj">for your brother was dead and is alive again, and was lost and is found.&#8217; &#8221;</span></span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-25591a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Luke 15:2">Luke 15:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>welcomes</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-25596b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Luke 15:7">Luke 15:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>upright</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-25597c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Luke 15:8">Luke 15:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Gr. <i>drachma,</i> a valuable coin often worn in a ten-piece garland by married women</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-25602d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Luke 15:13">Luke 15:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>wasteful</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-25605e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Luke 15:16">Luke 15:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>carob pods</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-25611f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Luke 15:22">Luke 15:22</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>Quickly bring</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
