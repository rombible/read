<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and spoke to Him, saying, &#8220;Tell us, by what authority are You doing these things? Or who is he who gave You this authority?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But He answered and said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;I also will ask you one thing, and answer Me:</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span><span class="woj">The</span> <span class="woj">baptism of John&#8212;was it from heaven or from men?&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And they reasoned among themselves, saying, &#8220;If we say, &#8216;From heaven,&#8217; He will say, &#8216;Why <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>then did you not believe him?&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But if we say, &#8216;From men,&#8217; all the people will stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So they answered that they did not know where <i>it was</i> from.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And Jesus said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
The Parable of the Wicked Vinedressers</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-20-9"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then He began to tell the people this parable: <span class="woj">&#8220;A certain man planted a vineyard, leased it to</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span><span class="woj">vinedressers, and went into a far country for a long time.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><span class="woj">Now at</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span><span class="woj">vintage-time he</span> <span class="woj">sent a servant to the vinedressers, that they might give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the vinedressers beat him and sent <i>him</i> away empty-handed.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span><span class="woj">Again he sent another servant; and they beat him also, treated <i>him</i> shamefully, and sent <i>him</i> away empty-handed.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span><span class="woj">And again he sent a third; and they wounded him also and cast <i>him</i> out.</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;Then the owner of the vineyard said, &#8216;What shall I do? I will send my beloved son. Probably they will respect <i>him</i> when they see him.&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span><span class="woj">But when the vinedressers saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, &#8216;This is the</span> <span class="woj">heir. Come,</span> <span class="woj">let us kill him, that the inheritance may be</span> <span class="woj">ours.&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span><span class="woj">So they cast him out of the vineyard and</span> <span class="woj">killed <i>him.</i> Therefore what will the owner of the vineyard do to them?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span><span class="woj">He will come and destroy those vinedressers and give the vineyard to</span> <span class="woj">others.&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span class="text Luke-20-16">And when they heard <i>it</i> they said, &#8220;Certainly not!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then He looked at them and said, <span class="woj">&#8220;What then is this that is written:</span></span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Luke-20-17"><span class="woj">&#8216;The stone which the builders rejected</span></span><br /><span class="text Luke-20-17"><span class="woj">Has become the chief cornerstone&#8217;?</span></span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span><span class="woj">Whoever falls on that stone will be</span> <span class="woj">broken; but</span> <span class="woj">on whomever it falls, it will grind him to powder.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And the chief priests and the scribes that very hour sought to lay hands on Him, but they <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>feared the people&#8212;for they knew He had spoken this parable against them.</span></p> <h3>
The Pharisees: Is It Lawful to Pay Taxes to Caesar?</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-20-20"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So they watched <i>Him,</i> and sent spies who pretended to be righteous, that they might seize on His words, in order to deliver Him to the power and the authority of the governor.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then they asked Him, saying, &#8220;Teacher, we know that You say and teach rightly, and You do not show personal favoritism, but teach the way of God in truth: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>But He perceived their craftiness, and said to them, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;Why do you test Me?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span><span class="woj">Show Me a denarius. Whose image and inscription does it have?&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span class="text Luke-20-24">They answered and said, &#8220;Caesar&#8217;s.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Render</span><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span> <span class="woj">therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar&#8217;s, and to God the things that are God&#8217;s.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>But they could not catch Him in His words in the presence of the people. And they marveled at His answer and kept silent.</span></p> <h3>
The Sadducees: What About the Resurrection?</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-20-27"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Then some of the Sadducees, who deny that there is a resurrection, came to <i>Him</i> and asked Him, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>saying: &#8220;Teacher, Moses wrote to us <i>that</i> if a man&#8217;s brother dies, having a wife, and he dies without children, his brother should take his wife and raise up offspring for his brother. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Now there were seven brothers. And the first took a wife, and died without children. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And the second <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>took her as wife, and he died childless. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Then the third took her, and in like manner the seven <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>also; and they left no children, and died. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Last of all the woman died also. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife does she become? For all seven had her as wife.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Jesus answered and said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span><span class="woj">But those who are</span> <span class="woj">counted worthy to attain that age, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span><span class="woj">nor can they die anymore, for</span> <span class="woj">they are equal to the angels and are sons of God,</span> <span class="woj">being sons of the resurrection.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span><span class="woj">But even Moses showed in the <i>burning</i> bush <i>passage</i> that the dead are raised, when he called the Lord</span> <span class="woj">&#8216;the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span><span class="woj">For He is not the God of the dead but of the living, for</span> <span class="woj">all live to Him.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>Then some of the scribes answered and said, &#8220;Teacher, You have spoken well.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>But after that they dared not question Him anymore.</span></p> <h3>
Jesus: How Can David Call His Descendant Lord?</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-20-41"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>And He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;How can they say that the Christ is the Son of David?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span><span class="woj">Now David himself said in the Book of Psalms:</span></span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Luke-20-42"><span class="woj">&#8216;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to my Lord,</span></span><br /><span class="text Luke-20-42"><span class="woj">&#8220;Sit at My right hand,</span></span><br />
