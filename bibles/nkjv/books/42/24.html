<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>But they found the stone rolled away from the tomb. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then they went in and did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And it happened, as they were <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>greatly perplexed about this, that behold, two men stood by them in shining garments. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then, as they were afraid and bowed <i>their</i> faces to the earth, they said to them, &#8220;Why do you seek the living among the dead? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>He is not here, but is risen! Remember how He spoke to you when He was still in Galilee, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>saying, <span class="woj">&#8216;The Son of Man must be</span> <span class="woj">delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.&#8217;</span> &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And they remembered His words. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then they returned from the tomb and told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary <i>the mother</i> of James, and the other <i>women</i> with them, who told these things to the apostles. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And their words seemed to them like <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>idle tales, and they did not believe them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But Peter arose and ran to the tomb; and stooping down, he saw the linen cloths <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>lying by themselves; and he departed, marveling to himself at what had happened.</span></p> <h3>
The Road to Emmaus</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-24-13"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Now behold, two of them were traveling that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>seven miles from Jerusalem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And they talked together of all these things which had happened. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So it was, while they conversed and reasoned, that Jesus Himself drew near and went with them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But their eyes were restrained, so that they did not know Him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;What kind of conversation <i>is</i> this that you have with one another as you</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span><span class="woj">walk and are sad?&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then the one whose name was Cleopas answered and said to Him, &#8220;Are You the only stranger in Jerusalem, and have You not known the things which happened there in these days?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;What things?&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span class="text Luke-24-19">So they said to Him, &#8220;The things concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a Prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him to be condemned to death, and crucified Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>But we were hoping that it was He who was going to redeem Israel. Indeed, besides all this, today is the third day since these things happened. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Yes, and certain women of our company, who arrived at the tomb early, astonished us. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>When they did not find His body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said He was alive. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And certain of those <i>who were</i> with us went to the tomb and found <i>it</i> just as the women had said; but Him they did not see.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span><span class="woj">Ought not the Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into His</span> <span class="woj">glory?&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And beginning at Moses and all the Prophets, He <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>expounded to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.</span></p> <h3>
The Disciples&#8217; Eyes Opened</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-24-28"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then they drew near to the village where they were going, and He <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>indicated that He would have gone farther. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>But they constrained Him, saying, &#8220;Abide with us, for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent.&#8221; And He went in to stay with them.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Now it came to pass, as He sat at the table with them, that He took bread, blessed and broke <i>it,</i> and gave it to them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Then their eyes were opened and they knew Him; and He vanished from their sight.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And they said to one another, &#8220;Did not our heart burn within us while He talked with us on the road, and while He opened the Scriptures to us?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>So they rose up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven and those <i>who were</i> with them gathered together, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>saying, &#8220;The Lord is risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>And they told about the things <i>that had happened</i> on the road, and how He was <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>known to them in the breaking of bread.</span></p> <h3>
Jesus Appears to His Disciples</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-24-36"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Now as they said these things, Jesus Himself stood in the midst of them, and said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Peace to you.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>But they were terrified and frightened, and supposed they had seen a spirit. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>And He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Why are you troubled? And why do doubts arise in your hearts?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span><span class="woj">Behold My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself.</span> <span class="woj">Handle Me and see, for a</span> <span class="woj">spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see I have.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>When He had said this, He showed them His hands and His feet. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>But while they still did not believe for joy, and marveled, He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Have you any food here?&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>So they gave Him a piece of a broiled fish <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span>and some honeycomb. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>And He took <i>it</i> and ate in their presence.</span></p> <h3>
The Scriptures Opened</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-24-44"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>Then He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;These <i>are</i> the words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the Law of Moses and <i>the</i> Prophets and <i>the</i> Psalms concerning Me.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>And He opened their understanding, that they might comprehend the Scriptures.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span>Then He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Thus it is written,</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[l]</a></span><span class="woj">and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day,</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-47.htm"><b>47</b></a></span><span class="woj">and that repentance and</span> <span class="woj">remission of sins should be preached in His name</span> <span class="woj">to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-48.htm"><b>48</b></a></span><span class="woj">And</span> <span class="woj">you are witnesses of these things.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-49.htm"><b>49</b></a></span><span class="woj">Behold, I send the Promise of My Father upon you; but tarry in the city</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[m]</a></span><span class="woj">of Jerusalem until you are endued with power from on high.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
The Ascension</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-24-50"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-50.htm"><b>50</b></a></span>And He led them out as far as Bethany, and He lifted up His hands and blessed them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-51.htm"><b>51</b></a></span>Now it came to pass, while He blessed them, that He was parted from them and carried up into heaven. </span>
