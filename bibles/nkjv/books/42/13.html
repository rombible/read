<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Jesus answered and said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Do you suppose that these Galileans were worse sinners than all <i>other</i> Galileans, because they suffered such things?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span><span class="woj">I tell you, no; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span><span class="woj">Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them, do you think that they were worse sinners than all <i>other</i> men who dwelt in Jerusalem?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span><span class="woj">I tell you, no; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
The Parable of the Barren Fig Tree</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-13-6"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/13-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>He also spoke this parable: <span class="woj">&#8220;A certain <i>man</i> had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it and found none.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/13-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span><span class="woj">Then he said to the keeper of his vineyard, &#8216;Look, for three years I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none. Cut it down; why does it</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span><span class="woj">use up the ground?&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><span class="woj">But he answered and said to him, &#8216;Sir, let it alone this year also, until I dig around it and fertilize <i>it.</i></span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/13-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span><span class="woj">And if it bears fruit, <i>well.</i> But if not, after that you can</span> <span class="woj">cut it down.&#8217; &#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
A Spirit of Infirmity</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-13-10"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/13-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Now He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bent over and could in no way <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>raise <i>herself</i> up. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/13-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But when Jesus saw her, He called <i>her</i> to <i>Him</i> and said to her, <span class="woj">&#8220;Woman, you are loosed from your</span> <span class="woj">infirmity.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/13-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And He laid <i>His</i> hands on her, and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/13-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath; and he said to the crowd, &#8220;There are six days on which men ought to work; therefore come and be healed on them, and not on the Sabbath day.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/13-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>The Lord then answered him and said, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;Hypocrite!</span> <span class="woj">Does not each one of you on the Sabbath loose his ox or donkey from the stall, and lead <i>it</i> away to water it?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/13-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span><span class="woj">So ought not this woman,</span> <span class="woj">being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has bound&#8212;think of it&#8212;for eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath?&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/13-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And when He said these things, all His adversaries were put to shame; and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by Him.</span></p> <h3>
The Parable of the Mustard Seed</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-13-18"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/13-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then He said, <span class="woj">&#8220;What is the kingdom of God like? And to what shall I compare it?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/13-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span><span class="woj">It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and put in his garden; and it grew and became a</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span><span class="woj">large tree, and the birds of the air nested in its branches.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
The Parable of the Leaven</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-13-20"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/13-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And again He said, <span class="woj">&#8220;To what shall I liken the kingdom of God?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/13-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span><span class="woj">It is like</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span><span class="woj">leaven, which a woman took and hid in three</span> <span class="woj">measures</span><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span> <span class="woj">of meal till it was all leavened.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
The Narrow Way</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-13-22"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/13-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And He went through the cities and villages, teaching, and journeying toward Jerusalem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/13-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Then one said to Him, &#8220;Lord, are there few who are saved?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Luke-13-23">And He said to them, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/13-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;Strive to enter through the narrow gate, for</span> <span class="woj">many, I say to you, will seek to enter and will not be able.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/13-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span><span class="woj">When once the Master of the house has risen up and</span> <span class="woj">shut the door, and you begin to stand outside and knock at the door, saying,</span> <span class="woj">&#8216;Lord, Lord, open for us,&#8217; and He will answer and say to you,</span> <span class="woj">&#8216;I do not know you, where you are from,&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/13-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span><span class="woj">then you will begin to say, &#8216;We ate and drank in Your presence, and You taught in our streets.&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/13-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span><span class="woj">But He will say, &#8216;I tell you I do not know you, where you are from.</span> <span class="woj">Depart from Me, all you workers of iniquity.&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/13-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span><span class="woj">There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth,</span> <span class="woj">when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and yourselves thrust out.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/13-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span><span class="woj">They will come from the east and the west, from the north and the south, and sit down in the kingdom of God.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/13-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span><span class="woj">And indeed there are last who will be first, and there are first who will be last.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/13-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>On that very day some Pharisees came, saying to Him, &#8220;Get out and depart from here, for Herod wants to kill You.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/13-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Go, tell that fox, &#8216;Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third <i>day</i></span> <span class="woj">I shall be</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span><span class="woj">perfected.&#8217;</span> </span>
