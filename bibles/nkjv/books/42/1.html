<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>just as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word delivered them to us, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>it seemed good to me also, having <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write to you an orderly account, most excellent Theophilus, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>that you may know the certainty of those things in which you were instructed.</span></p> <h3>
John&#8217;s Birth Announced to Zacharias</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-1-5"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the division of Abijah. His wife <i>was</i> of the daughters of Aaron, and her name <i>was</i> Elizabeth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both well advanced in years.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So it was, that while he was serving as priest before God in the order of his division, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>according to the custom of the priesthood, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>his lot fell to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And the whole multitude of the people was praying outside at the hour of incense. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right side of the altar of incense. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And when Zacharias saw <i>him,</i> he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>But the angel said to him, &#8220;Do not be afraid, Zacharias, for your prayer is heard; and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink. He will also be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother&#8217;s womb. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And he will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>He will also go before Him in the spirit and power of Elijah, <span class="oblique">&#8216;to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,&#8217;</span> and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And Zacharias said to the angel, &#8220;How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And the angel answered and said to him, &#8220;I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God, and was sent to speak to you and bring you <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>these glad tidings. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>But behold, you will be mute and not able to speak until the day these things take place, because you did not believe my words which will be fulfilled in their own time.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And the people waited for Zacharias, and marveled that he lingered so long in the temple. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But when he came out, he could not speak to them; and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple, for he beckoned to them and remained speechless.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>So it was, as soon as the days of his service were completed, that he departed to his own house. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Now after those days his wife Elizabeth conceived; and she hid herself five months, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>&#8220;Thus the Lord has dealt with me, in the days when He looked on <i>me,</i> to take away my reproach among people.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Christ&#8217;s Birth Announced to Mary</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-1-26"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin&#8217;s name <i>was</i> Mary. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And having come in, the angel said to her, &#8220;Rejoice, highly favored <i>one,</i> the Lord <i>is</i> with you; <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>blessed <i>are</i> you among women!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>But <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>when she saw <i>him,</i> she was troubled at his saying, and considered what manner of greeting this was. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Then the angel said to her, &#8220;Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bring forth a Son, and shall call His name <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Jesus</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His kingdom there will be no end.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Then Mary said to the angel, &#8220;How can this be, since I <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>do not know a man?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>And the angel answered and said to her, &#8220;<i>The</i> Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Highest will overshadow you; therefore, also, that Holy One who is to be born will be called the Son of God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Now indeed, Elizabeth your relative has also conceived a son in her old age; and this is now the sixth month for her who was called barren. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>For with God nothing will be impossible.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>Then Mary said, &#8220;Behold the maidservant of the Lord! Let it be to me according to your word.&#8221; And the angel departed from her.</span></p> <h3>
Mary Visits Elizabeth</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-1-39"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>Now Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste, to a city of Judah, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>and entered the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>And it happened, when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, that the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>Then she spoke out with a loud voice and said, &#8220;Blessed <i>are</i> you among women, and blessed <i>is</i> the fruit of your womb! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>But why <i>is</i> this <i>granted</i> to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>For indeed, as soon as the voice of your greeting sounded in my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>Blessed <i>is</i> she who <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>believed, for there will be a fulfillment of those things which were told her from the Lord.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
The Song of Mary</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-1-46"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span>And Mary said:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Luke-1-46">&#8220;My soul <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>magnifies the Lord,</span><br />

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-48.htm"><b>48</b></a></span>For He has regarded the lowly state of His maidservant;</span><br /><span class="text Luke-1-48">For behold, henceforth all generations will call me blessed.</span><br />

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-50.htm"><b>50</b></a></span>And His mercy <i>is</i> on those who fear Him</span><br /><span class="text Luke-1-50">From generation to generation.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-51.htm"><b>51</b></a></span>He has shown strength with His arm;</span><br /><span class="text Luke-1-51">He has scattered <i>the</i> proud in the imagination of their hearts.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-52.htm"><b>52</b></a></span>He has put down the mighty from <i>their</i> thrones,</span><br /><span class="text Luke-1-52">And exalted <i>the</i> lowly.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-53.htm"><b>53</b></a></span>He has filled <i>the</i> hungry with good things,</span><br /><span class="text Luke-1-53">And <i>the</i> rich He has sent away empty.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-54.htm"><b>54</b></a></span>He has helped His servant Israel,</span><br /><span class="text Luke-1-54">In remembrance of <i>His</i> mercy,</span><br />

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-56.htm"><b>56</b></a></span>And Mary remained with her about three months, and returned to her house.</span></p> <h3>
Birth of John the Baptist</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-1-57"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-57.htm"><b>57</b></a></span>Now Elizabeth&#8217;s full time came for her to be delivered, and she brought forth a son. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-58.htm"><b>58</b></a></span>When her neighbors and relatives heard how the Lord had shown great mercy to her, they rejoiced with her.</span></p> <h3>
Circumcision of John the Baptist</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-1-59"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-59.htm"><b>59</b></a></span>So it was, on the eighth day, that they came to circumcise the child; and they would have called him by the name of his father, Zacharias. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-60.htm"><b>60</b></a></span>His mother answered and said, &#8220;No; he shall be called John.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-61.htm"><b>61</b></a></span>But they said to her, &#8220;There is no one among your relatives who is called by this name.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-62.htm"><b>62</b></a></span>So they made signs to his father&#8212;what he would have him called.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-63.htm"><b>63</b></a></span>And he asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, saying, &#8220;His name is John.&#8221; So they all marveled. </span>
