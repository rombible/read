<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span><span class="woj">So he called him and said to him, &#8216;What is this I hear about you? Give an</span> <span class="woj">account of your stewardship, for you can no longer be steward.&#8217;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;Then the steward said within himself, &#8216;What shall I do? For my master is taking the stewardship away from me. I cannot dig; I am ashamed to beg.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span><span class="woj">I have resolved what to do, that when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.&#8217;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;So he called every one of his master&#8217;s debtors to <i>him,</i> and said to the first, &#8216;How much do you owe my master?&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span><span class="woj">And he said, &#8216;A hundred</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span><span class="woj">measures of oil.&#8217; So he said to him, &#8216;Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span><span class="woj">Then he said to another, &#8216;And how much do you owe?&#8217; So he said, &#8216;A hundred</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span><span class="woj">measures of wheat.&#8217; And he said to him, &#8216;Take your bill, and write eighty.&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><span class="woj">So the master commended the unjust steward because he had dealt shrewdly. For the sons of this world are more shrewd in their generation than</span> <span class="woj">the sons of light.</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;And I say to you,</span> <span class="woj">make friends for yourselves by unrighteous</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span><span class="woj">mammon, that when</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span><span class="woj">you fail, they may receive you into an everlasting home.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><span class="woj">He who <i>is</i> faithful in <i>what is</i> least is faithful also in much; and he who is unjust in <i>what is</i> least is unjust also in much.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span><span class="woj">Therefore if you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true <i>riches?</i></span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span><span class="woj">And if you have not been faithful in what is another man&#8217;s, who will give you what is your</span> <span class="woj">own?</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;No servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
The Law, the Prophets, and the Kingdom</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-16-14"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Now the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, also heard all these things, and they <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>derided Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;You are those who</span> <span class="woj">justify yourselves</span> <span class="woj">before men, but</span> <span class="woj">God knows your hearts. For</span> <span class="woj">what is highly esteemed among men is an abomination in the sight of God.</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;The law and the prophets <i>were</i> until John. Since that time the kingdom of God has been preached, and everyone is pressing into it.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span><span class="woj">And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span><span class="woj">tittle of the law to fail.</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery; and whoever marries her who is divorced from <i>her</i> husband commits adultery.</span></span></p> <h3>
The Rich Man and Lazarus</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-16-19"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;There was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span><span class="woj">fared sumptuously every day.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span><span class="woj">But there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, full of sores, who was laid at his gate,</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span><span class="woj">desiring to be fed with</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span><span class="woj">the crumbs which fell from the rich man&#8217;s table. Moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span><span class="woj">So it was that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels to</span> <span class="woj">Abraham&#8217;s bosom. The rich man also died and was buried.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span><span class="woj">And being in torments in Hades, he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;Then he cried and said, &#8216;Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and</span> <span class="woj">cool my tongue; for I</span> <span class="woj">am tormented in this flame.&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span><span class="woj">But Abraham said, &#8216;Son,</span> <span class="woj">remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things; but now he is comforted and you are tormented.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span><span class="woj">And besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, so that those who want to pass from here to you cannot, nor can those from there pass to us.&#8217;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;Then he said, &#8216;I beg you therefore, father, that you would send him to my father&#8217;s house,</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span><span class="woj">for I have five brothers, that he may testify to them, lest they also come to this place of torment.&#8217;</span> </span>
