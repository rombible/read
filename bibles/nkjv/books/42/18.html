<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>saying: <span class="woj">&#8220;There was in a certain city a judge who did not fear God nor</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span><span class="woj">regard man.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span><span class="woj">Now there was a widow in that city; and she came to him, saying,</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span><span class="woj">&#8216;Get justice for me from my adversary.&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span><span class="woj">And he would not for a while; but afterward he said within himself, &#8216;Though I do not fear God nor regard man,</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span><span class="woj">yet because this widow troubles me I will</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span><span class="woj">avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.&#8217; &#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then the Lord said, <span class="woj">&#8220;Hear what the unjust judge said.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span><span class="woj">And</span> <span class="woj">shall God not avenge His own elect who cry out day and night to Him, though He bears long with them?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><span class="woj">I tell you</span> <span class="woj">that He will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will He really find faith on the earth?&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
The Parable of the Pharisee and the Tax Collector</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-18-9"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Also He spoke this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span><span class="woj">The Pharisee</span> <span class="woj">stood and prayed thus with himself,</span> <span class="woj">&#8216;God, I thank You that I am not like other men&#8212;extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this tax collector.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span><span class="woj">I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I possess.&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span><span class="woj">And the tax collector, standing afar off, would not so much as raise <i>his</i> eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, &#8216;God, be merciful to me a sinner!&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span><span class="woj">I tell you, this man went down to his house justified <i>rather</i> than the other;</span> <span class="woj">for everyone who exalts himself will be</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span><span class="woj">humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Jesus Blesses Little Children</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-18-15"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then they also brought infants to Him that He might touch them; but when the disciples saw <i>it,</i> they rebuked them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But Jesus called them to <i>Him</i> and said, <span class="woj">&#8220;Let the little children come to Me, and do not forbid them; for</span> <span class="woj">of such is the kingdom of God.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span><span class="woj">Assuredly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will by no means enter it.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Jesus Counsels the Rich Young Ruler</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-18-18"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Now a certain ruler asked Him, saying, &#8220;Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>So Jesus said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;Why do you call Me good? No one <i>is</i> good but</span> <span class="woj">One, <i>that is,</i> God.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span><span class="woj">You know the commandments:</span> <span class="woj">&#8216;Do not commit adultery,&#8217; &#8216;Do not murder,&#8217; &#8216;Do not steal,&#8217; &#8216;Do not bear false witness,&#8217;</span> <span class="woj">&#8216;Honor your father and your mother.&#8217;</span> <span class="woj">&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;All these things I have kept from my youth.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So when Jesus heard these things, He said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;You still lack one thing.</span> <span class="woj">Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>But when he heard this, he became very sorrowful, for he was very rich.</span></p> <h3>
With God All Things Are Possible</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-18-24"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And when Jesus saw that he became very sorrowful, He said, <span class="woj">&#8220;How hard it is for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God!</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span><span class="woj">For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And those who heard it said, &#8220;Who then can be saved?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>But He said, <span class="woj">&#8220;The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then Peter said, &#8220;See, we have left <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>all and followed You.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>So He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Assuredly, I say to you,</span> <span class="woj">there is no one who has left house or parents or brothers or wife or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span><span class="woj">who shall not receive many times more in this present time, and in the age to come eternal life.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Jesus a Third Time Predicts His Death and Resurrection</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-18-31"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Then He took the twelve aside and said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all things</span> <span class="woj">that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span><span class="woj">accomplished.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span><span class="woj">For</span> <span class="woj">He will be delivered to the Gentiles and will be mocked and insulted and spit upon.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span><span class="woj">They will scourge <i>Him</i> and kill Him. And the third day He will rise again.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>But they understood none of these things; this saying was hidden from them, and they did not know the things which were spoken.</span></p> <h3>
A Blind Man Receives His Sight</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-18-35"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Then it happened, as He was coming near Jericho, that a certain blind man sat by the road begging. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>And hearing a multitude passing by, he asked what it meant. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>So they told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>And he cried out, saying, &#8220;Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>Then those who went before warned him that he should be quiet; but he cried out all the more, &#8220;Son of David, have mercy on me!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>So Jesus stood still and commanded him to be brought to Him. And when he had come near, He asked him, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>saying, <span class="woj">&#8220;What do you want Me to do for you?&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span class="text Luke-18-41">He said, &#8220;Lord, that I may receive my sight.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>Then Jesus said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;Receive your sight;</span> <span class="woj">your faith has made you well.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>And immediately he received his sight, and followed Him, glorifying God.
