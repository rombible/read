<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And behold, there was a certain man before Him who had dropsy. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And Jesus, answering, spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, <span class="woj">&#8220;Is it lawful to heal on the</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span><span class="woj">Sabbath?&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But they kept silent. And He took <i>him</i> and healed him, and let him go. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then He answered them, saying, <span class="woj">&#8220;Which of you, having a</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span><span class="woj">donkey or an ox that has fallen into a pit, will not immediately pull him out on the Sabbath day?&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And they could not answer Him regarding these things.</span></p> <h3>
Take the Lowly Place</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-14-7"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So He told a parable to those who were invited, when He noted how they chose the best places, saying to them: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;When you are invited by anyone to a wedding feast, do not sit down in the best place, lest one more honorable than you be invited by him;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span><span class="woj">and he who invited you and him come and say to you, &#8216;Give place to this man,&#8217; and then you begin with shame to take the lowest place.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><span class="woj">But when you are invited, go and sit down in the lowest place, so that when he who invited you comes he may say to you, &#8216;Friend, go up higher.&#8217; Then you will have glory in the presence of those who sit at the table with you.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span><span class="woj">For whoever exalts himself will be</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span><span class="woj">humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then He also said to him who invited Him, <span class="woj">&#8220;When you give a dinner or a supper, do not ask your friends, your brothers, your relatives, nor rich neighbors, lest they also invite you back, and you be repaid.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span><span class="woj">But when you give a feast, invite</span> <span class="woj"><i>the</i> poor, <i>the</i></span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span><span class="woj">maimed, <i>the</i> lame, <i>the</i> blind.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span><span class="woj">And you will be</span> <span class="woj">blessed, because they cannot repay you; for you shall be repaid at the resurrection of the just.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
The Parable of the Great Supper</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-14-15"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Now when one of those who sat at the table with Him heard these things, he said to Him, &#8220;Blessed <i>is</i> he who shall eat <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>bread in the kingdom of God!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then He said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;A certain man gave a great supper and invited many,</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span><span class="woj">and</span> <span class="woj">sent his servant at supper time to say to those who were invited, &#8216;Come, for all things are now ready.&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span><span class="woj">But they all with one <i>accord</i> began to make excuses. The first said to him, &#8216;I have bought a piece of ground, and I must go and see it. I ask you to have me excused.&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span><span class="woj">And another said, &#8216;I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to test them. I ask you to have me excused.&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span><span class="woj">Still another said, &#8216;I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span><span class="woj">So that servant came and reported these things to his master. Then the master of the house, being angry, said to his servant, &#8216;Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in here <i>the</i> poor and <i>the</i></span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span><span class="woj">maimed and <i>the</i> lame and <i>the</i> blind.&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span><span class="woj">And the servant said, &#8216;Master, it is done as you commanded, and still there is room.&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span><span class="woj">Then the master said to the servant, &#8216;Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel <i>them</i> to come in, that my house may be filled.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span><span class="woj">For I say to you</span> <span class="woj">that none of those men who were invited shall taste my supper.&#8217; &#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Leaving All to Follow Christ</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-14-25"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Now great multitudes went with Him. And He turned and said to them, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;If anyone comes to Me</span> <span class="woj">and does not hate his father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters,</span> <span class="woj">yes, and his own life also, he cannot be My disciple.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span><span class="woj">And</span> <span class="woj">whoever does not bear his cross and come after Me cannot be My disciple.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span><span class="woj">For</span> <span class="woj">which of you, intending to build a tower, does not sit down first and count the cost, whether he has <i>enough</i> to finish <i>it</i>&#8212;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span><span class="woj">lest, after he has laid the foundation, and is not able to finish, all who see <i>it</i> begin to mock him,</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span><span class="woj">saying, &#8216;This man began to build and was not able to finish&#8217;?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span><span class="woj">Or what king, going to make war against another king, does not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span><span class="woj">Or else, while the other is still a great way off, he sends a delegation and asks conditions of peace.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span><span class="woj">So likewise, whoever of you</span> <span class="woj">does not forsake all that he has cannot be My disciple.</span></span></p> <h3>
