<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/22-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might kill Him, for they feared the people.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/22-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then Satan entered Judas, surnamed Iscariot, who was numbered among the twelve. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/22-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So he went his way and conferred with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray Him to them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/22-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And they were glad, and agreed to give him money. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/22-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So he promised and sought opportunity to betray Him to them in the absence of the multitude.</span></p> <h3>
Jesus and His Disciples Prepare the Passover</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-22-7"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/22-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then came the Day of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover must be <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>killed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/22-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And He sent Peter and John, saying, <span class="woj">&#8220;Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/22-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So they said to Him, &#8220;Where do You want us to prepare?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/22-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Behold, when you have entered the city, a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water; follow him into the house which he enters.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/22-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span><span class="woj">Then you shall say to the master of the house, &#8216;The Teacher says to you, &#8220;Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with My disciples?&#8221; &#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/22-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span><span class="woj">Then he will show you a large, furnished upper room; there make ready.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/22-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;With <i>fervent</i> desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer;</span> </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/22-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then He took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, <span class="woj">&#8220;Take this and divide <i>it</i> among yourselves;</span> </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/22-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Likewise He also <i>took</i> the cup after supper, saying, <span class="woj">&#8220;This cup <i>is</i> the new covenant in My blood, which is shed for you.</span> </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/22-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Then they began to question among themselves, which of them it was who would do this thing.</span></p> <h3>
The Disciples Argue About Greatness</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-22-24"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/22-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Now there was also a dispute among them, as to which of them should be considered the greatest. </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/22-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>Then an angel appeared to Him from heaven, strengthening Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/22-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>And being in agony, He prayed more earnestly. Then His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/22-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>When He rose up from prayer, and had come to His disciples, He found them sleeping from sorrow. </span>

Betrayal and Arrest in Gethsemane</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-22-47"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/22-47.htm"><b>47</b></a></span>And while He was still speaking, behold, a multitude; and he who was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them and drew near to Jesus to kiss Him. </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/22-49.htm"><b>49</b></a></span>When those around Him saw what was going to happen, they said to Him, &#8220;Lord, shall we strike with the sword?&#8221; </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/22-52.htm"><b>52</b></a></span>Then Jesus said to the chief priests, captains of the temple, and the elders who had come to Him, <span class="woj">&#8220;Have you come out, as against a</span> <span class="woj">robber, with swords and clubs?</span> </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/22-55.htm"><b>55</b></a></span>Now when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat among them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/22-56.htm"><b>56</b></a></span>And a certain servant girl, seeing him as he sat by the fire, looked intently at him and said, &#8220;This man was also with Him.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
