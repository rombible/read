<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;The harvest truly <i>is</i> great, but the laborers <i>are</i> few; therefore</span> <span class="woj">pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span><span class="woj">Go your way;</span> <span class="woj">behold, I send you out as lambs among wolves.</span> </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/10-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Then He turned to <i>His</i> disciples and said privately, <span class="woj">&#8220;Blessed <i>are</i> the eyes which see the things you see;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/10-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span><span class="woj">for I tell you</span> <span class="woj">that many prophets and kings have desired to see what you see, and have not seen <i>it,</i> and to hear what you hear, and have not heard <i>it.</i>&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
The Parable of the Good Samaritan</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-10-25"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/10-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And behold, a certain <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>lawyer stood up and tested Him, saying, &#8220;Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/10-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>He said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;What is written in the law? What is your reading <i>of it?</i>&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/10-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>So he answered and said, &#8220; <span class="oblique">&#8216;You shall love the</span> <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <span class="oblique">your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind,&#8217;</span> and <span class="oblique">&#8216;your neighbor as yourself.&#8217;</span> &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/10-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And He said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;You have answered rightly; do this and</span> <span class="woj">you will live.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/10-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>But he, wanting to justify himself, said to Jesus, &#8220;And who is my neighbor?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/10-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Then Jesus answered and said: <span class="woj">&#8220;A certain <i>man</i> went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span><span class="woj">thieves, who stripped him of his clothing, wounded <i>him,</i> and departed, leaving <i>him</i> half dead.</span> </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/10-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span><span class="woj">Likewise a Levite, when he arrived at the place, came and looked, and passed by on the other side.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/10-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span><span class="woj">But a certain</span> <span class="woj">Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was. And when he saw him, he had</span> <span class="woj">compassion.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/10-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span><span class="woj">So he went to <i>him</i> and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine; and he set him on his own animal, brought him to an inn, and took care of him.</span> </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/10-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span><span class="woj">So which of these three do you think was neighbor to him who fell among the thieves?&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/10-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;He who showed mercy on him.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Luke-10-37">Then Jesus said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;Go and do likewise.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
