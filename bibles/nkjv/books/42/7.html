<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And a certain centurion&#8217;s servant, who was dear to him, was sick and ready to die. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So when he heard about Jesus, he sent elders of the Jews to Him, pleading with Him to come and heal his servant. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And when they came to Jesus, they begged Him earnestly, saying that the one for whom He should do this was deserving, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8220;for he loves our nation, and has built us a synagogue.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then Jesus went with them. And when He was already not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to Him, saying to Him, &#8220;Lord, do not trouble Yourself, for I am not worthy that You should enter under my roof. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Therefore I did not even think myself worthy to come to You. But say the word, and my servant will be healed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For I also am a man placed under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to one, &#8216;Go,&#8217; and he goes; and to another, &#8216;Come,&#8217; and he comes; and to my servant, &#8216;Do this,&#8217; and he does <i>it.</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>When Jesus heard these things, He marveled at him, and turned around and said to the crowd that followed Him, <span class="woj">&#8220;I say to you, I have not found such great faith, not even in Israel!&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And those who were sent, returning to the house, found the servant well <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>who had been sick.</span></p> <h3>
Jesus Raises the Son of the Widow of Nain</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-7-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now it happened, the day after, <i>that</i> He went into a city called Nain; and many of His disciples went with Him, and a large crowd. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And when He came near the gate of the city, behold, a dead man was being carried out, the only son of his mother; and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the city was with her. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>When the Lord saw her, He had compassion on her and said to her, <span class="woj">&#8220;Do not weep.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then He came and touched the open coffin, and those who carried <i>him</i> stood still. And He said, <span class="woj">&#8220;Young man, I say to you,</span> <span class="woj">arise.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So he who was dead sat up and began to speak. And He presented him to his mother.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then fear <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>came upon all, and they glorified God, saying, &#8220;A great prophet has risen up among us&#8221;; and, &#8220;God has visited His people.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And this report about Him went throughout all Judea and all the surrounding region.</span></p> <h3>
John the Baptist Sends Messengers to Jesus</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-7-18"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then the disciples of John reported to him concerning all these things. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And John, calling two of his disciples to <i>him,</i> sent <i>them</i> to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Jesus, saying, &#8220;Are You the Coming One, or <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>do we look for another?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>When the men had come to Him, they said, &#8220;John the Baptist has sent us to You, saying, &#8216;Are You the Coming One, or do we look for another?&#8217; &#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And that very hour He cured many of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>infirmities, afflictions, and evil spirits; and to many blind He gave sight.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Jesus answered and said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Go and tell John the things you have seen and heard:</span> <span class="woj">that <i>the</i> blind</span> <span class="woj">see, <i>the</i> lame</span> <span class="woj">walk, <i>the</i> lepers are</span> <span class="woj">cleansed, <i>the</i> deaf</span> <span class="woj">hear, <i>the</i> dead are raised,</span> <span class="woj"><i>the</i> poor have the gospel preached to them.</span> </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>When the messengers of John had departed, He began to speak to the multitudes concerning John: <span class="woj">&#8220;What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?</span> </span>

A Sinful Woman Forgiven</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-7-36"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Then one of the Pharisees asked Him to eat with him. And He went to the Pharisee&#8217;s house, and sat down to eat. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>And behold, a woman in the city who was a sinner, when she knew that <i>Jesus</i> sat at the table in the Pharisee&#8217;s house, brought an alabaster flask of fragrant oil, </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw <i>this,</i> he spoke to himself, saying, &#8220;This Man, if He were a prophet, would know who and what manner of woman <i>this is</i> who is touching Him, for she is a sinner.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>And Jesus answered and said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;Simon, I have something to say to you.&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span class="text Luke-7-40">So he said, &#8220;Teacher, say it.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
