<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And they began to accuse Him, saying, &#8220;We found this <i>fellow</i> perverting <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>the nation, and forbidding to pay taxes to Caesar, saying that He Himself is Christ, a King.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then Pilate asked Him, saying, &#8220;Are You the King of the Jews?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Luke-23-3">He answered him and said, <span class="woj">&#8220;<i>It is as</i> you say.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowd, &#8220;I find no fault in this Man.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But they were the more fierce, saying, &#8220;He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee to this place.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Jesus Faces Herod</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-23-6"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>When Pilate heard <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>of Galilee, he asked if the Man were a Galilean. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And as soon as he knew that He belonged to Herod&#8217;s jurisdiction, he sent Him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at that time. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad; for he had desired for a long <i>time</i> to see Him, because he had heard many things about Him, and he hoped to see some miracle done by Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then he questioned Him with many words, but He answered him nothing. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then Herod, with his <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>men of war, treated Him with contempt and mocked <i>Him,</i> arrayed Him in a gorgeous robe, and sent Him back to Pilate. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>That very day Pilate and Herod became friends with each other, for previously they had been at enmity with each other.</span></p> <h3>
Taking the Place of Barabbas</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-23-13"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>said to them, &#8220;You have brought this Man to me, as one who misleads the people. And indeed, having examined <i>Him</i> in your presence, I have found no fault in this Man concerning those things of which you accuse Him; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>no, neither did Herod, for <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>I sent you back to him; and indeed nothing deserving of death has been done by Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>I will therefore chastise Him and release <i>Him</i>&#8221; </span> 
17(for<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span> it was necessary for him to release one to them at the feast).</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And they all cried out at once, saying, &#8220;Away with this <i>Man,</i> and release to us Barabbas&#8221;&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>who had been thrown into prison for a certain rebellion made in the city, and for murder.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Pilate, therefore, wishing to release Jesus, again called out to them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>But they shouted, saying, &#8220;Crucify <i>Him,</i> crucify Him!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then he said to them the third time, &#8220;Why, what evil has He done? I have found no reason for death in Him. I will therefore chastise Him and let <i>Him</i> go.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>But they were insistent, demanding with loud voices that He be crucified. And the voices of these men <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>and of the chief priests prevailed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>So Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they requested. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And he released <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>to them the one they requested, who for rebellion and murder had been thrown into prison; but he delivered Jesus to their will.</span></p> <h3>
The King on a Cross</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-23-26"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Now as they led Him away, they laid hold of a certain man, Simon a Cyrenian, who was coming from the country, and on him they laid the cross that he might bear <i>it</i> after Jesus.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And a great multitude of the people followed Him, and women who also mourned and lamented Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>But Jesus, turning to them, said, <span class="woj">&#8220;Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for Me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span><span class="woj">For indeed the days are coming in which they will say, &#8216;Blessed <i>are</i> the barren, wombs that never bore, and breasts which never nursed!&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span><span class="woj">Then they will begin</span> <span class="woj">&#8216;to say to the mountains, &#8220;Fall on us!&#8221; and to the hills, &#8220;Cover us!&#8221; &#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span><span class="woj">For if they do these things in the green wood, what will be done in the dry?&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>There were also two others, criminals, led with Him to be put to death. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And when they had come to the place called Calvary, there they crucified Him, and the criminals, one on the right hand and the other on the left. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>Then Jesus said, <span class="woj">&#8220;Father,</span> <span class="woj">forgive them, for</span> <span class="woj">they do not know what they do.&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span class="text Luke-23-34">And they divided His garments and cast lots. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>And the people stood looking on. But even the rulers with them sneered, saying, &#8220;He saved others; let Him save Himself if He is the Christ, the chosen of God.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>The soldiers also mocked Him, coming and offering Him sour wine, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>and saying, &#8220;If You are the King of the Jews, save Yourself.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>And an inscription also was <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>written over Him in letters of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew:</span></p><p class="center_top-1"><span class="text Luke-23-38">THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span></p> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>Then one of the criminals who were hanged blasphemed Him, saying, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>&#8220;If You are the Christ, save Yourself and us.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>But the other, answering, rebuked him, saying, &#8220;Do you not even fear God, seeing you are under the same condemnation? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds; but this Man has done nothing wrong.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>Then he said <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span>to Jesus, &#8220;Lord, remember me when You come into Your kingdom.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>And Jesus said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;Assuredly, I say to you, today you will be with Me in</span> <span class="woj">Paradise.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Jesus Dies on the Cross</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-23-44"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>Now it <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[l]</a></span>was about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>Then the sun was <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[m]</a></span>darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[n]</a></span>two. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span>And when Jesus had cried out with a loud voice, He said, <span class="woj">&#8220;Father,</span> <span class="woj">&#8216;into Your hands I commit My spirit.&#8217;</span> <span class="woj">&#8221;</span> Having said this, He breathed His last.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-47.htm"><b>47</b></a></span>So when the centurion saw what had happened, he glorified God, saying, &#8220;Certainly this was a righteous Man!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-48.htm"><b>48</b></a></span>And the whole crowd who came together to that sight, seeing what had been done, beat their breasts and returned. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-49.htm"><b>49</b></a></span>But all His acquaintances, and the women who followed Him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.</span></p> <h3>
Jesus Buried in Joseph&#8217;s Tomb</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-23-50"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-50.htm"><b>50</b></a></span>Now behold, <i>there was</i> a man named Joseph, a council member, a good and just man. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-51.htm"><b>51</b></a></span>He had not consented to their decision and deed. <i>He was</i> from Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[o]</a></span> himself was also waiting for the kingdom of God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-52.htm"><b>52</b></a></span>This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-53.htm"><b>53</b></a></span>Then he took it down, wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a tomb <i>that was</i> hewn out of the rock, where no one had ever lain before. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-54.htm"><b>54</b></a></span>That day was the Preparation, and the Sabbath drew near.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-55.htm"><b>55</b></a></span>And the women who had come with Him from Galilee followed after, and they observed the tomb and how His body was laid. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-56.htm"><b>56</b></a></span>Then they returned and prepared spices and fragrant oils.
