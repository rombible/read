<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/17-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span><span class="woj">It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck, and he were thrown into the sea, than that he should</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span><span class="woj">offend one of these little ones.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/17-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span><span class="woj">Take heed to yourselves.</span> <span class="woj">If your brother sins</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span><span class="woj">against you,</span> <span class="woj">rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/17-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span><span class="woj">And if he sins against you seven times in a day, and seven times in a day returns</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span><span class="woj">to you, saying, &#8216;I repent,&#8217; you shall forgive him.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Faith and Duty</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-17-5"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/17-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And the apostles said to the Lord, &#8220;Increase our faith.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/17-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So the Lord said, <span class="woj">&#8220;If you have faith as a mustard seed, you can say to this mulberry tree, &#8216;Be pulled up by the roots and be planted in the sea,&#8217; and it would obey you.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/17-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span><span class="woj">And which of you, having a servant plowing or tending sheep, will say to him when he has come in from the field, &#8216;Come at once and sit down to eat&#8217;?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/17-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><span class="woj">But will he not rather say to him, &#8216;Prepare something for my supper, and gird yourself</span> <span class="woj">and serve me till I have eaten and drunk, and afterward you will eat and drink&#8217;?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/17-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span><span class="woj">Does he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span><span class="woj">him? I think not.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/17-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><span class="woj">So likewise you, when you have done all those things which you are commanded, say, &#8216;We are</span> <span class="woj">unprofitable servants. We have done what was our duty to do.&#8217; &#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Ten Lepers Cleansed</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-17-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/17-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now it happened as He went to Jerusalem that He passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/17-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then as He entered a certain village, there met Him ten men who were lepers, who stood afar off. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/17-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And they lifted up <i>their</i> voices and said, &#8220;Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/17-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So when He saw <i>them,</i> He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Go, show yourselves to the priests.&#8221;</span> And so it was that as they went, they were cleansed.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/17-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, returned, and with a loud voice glorified God, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/17-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>and fell down on <i>his</i> face at His feet, giving Him thanks. And he was a Samaritan.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/17-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So Jesus answered and said, <span class="woj">&#8220;Were there not ten cleansed? But where <i>are</i> the nine?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/17-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span><span class="woj">Were there not any found who returned to give glory to God except this foreigner?&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/17-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And He said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;Arise, go your way. Your faith has made you well.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
The Coming of the Kingdom</span></h3><p><span class="text Luke-17-20"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/17-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Now when He was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, He answered them and said, <span class="woj">&#8220;The kingdom of God does not come with observation;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/17-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span><span class="woj">nor will they say,</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span><span class="woj">&#8216;See here!&#8217; or &#8216;See there!&#8217; For indeed,</span> <span class="woj">the kingdom of God is</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span><span class="woj">within you.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/17-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then He said to the disciples, <span class="woj">&#8220;The days will come when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see <i>it.</i></span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/17-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span><span class="woj">And they will say to you,</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span><span class="woj">&#8216;Look here!&#8217; or &#8216;Look there!&#8217; Do not go after <i>them</i> or follow <i>them.</i></span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/17-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span><span class="woj">For as the lightning that flashes out of one <i>part</i> under heaven shines to the other <i>part</i> under heaven, so also the Son of Man will be in His day.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/17-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span><span class="woj">But first He must suffer many things and be</span> <span class="woj">rejected by this generation.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/17-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span><span class="woj">And as it</span> <span class="woj">was in the</span> <span class="woj">days of</span> <span class="woj">Noah, so it will be also in the days of the Son of Man:</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/17-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span><span class="woj">They ate, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the</span> <span class="woj">day that Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and</span> <span class="woj">destroyed them all.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/17-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span><span class="woj">Likewise as it was also in the days of Lot: They ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/17-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span><span class="woj">but on</span> <span class="woj">the day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed <i>them</i> all.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/17-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span><span class="woj">Even so will it be in the day when the Son of Man</span> <span class="woj">is revealed.</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/17-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;In that day, he</span> <span class="woj">who is on the housetop, and his</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span><span class="woj">goods <i>are</i> in the house, let him not come down to take them away.
