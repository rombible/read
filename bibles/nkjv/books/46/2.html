<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>I was with you in weakness, in fear, and in much trembling. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And my speech and my preaching <i>were</i> not with persuasive words of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>that your faith should not be in the wisdom of men but in the power of God.</span></p> <h3>
Spiritual Wisdom</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Cor-2-6"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>However, we speak wisdom among those who are mature, yet not the wisdom of this age, nor of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, the hidden <i>wisdom</i> which God <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>ordained before the ages for our glory, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>which none of the rulers of this age knew; for had they known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But as it is written:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text 1Cor-2-9"><span class="oblique">&#8220;Eye has not seen, nor ear heard,</span></span><br /><span class="text 1Cor-2-9"><span class="oblique">Nor have entered into the heart of man</span></span><br /><span class="text 1Cor-2-9"><span class="oblique">The things which God has prepared for those who love Him.&#8221;</span></span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>But God has revealed <i>them</i> to us through His Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For what man knows the things of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might know the things that have been freely given to us by God.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>These things we also speak, not in words which man&#8217;s wisdom teaches but which the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know <i>them,</i> because they are spiritually discerned. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But he who is spiritual judges all things, yet he himself is <i>rightly</i> judged by no one. </span>
