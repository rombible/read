<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Nevertheless, because of sexual immorality, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Let the husband render to his wife the affection due her, and likewise also the wife to her husband. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband <i>does.</i> And likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife <i>does.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Do not deprive one another except with consent for a time, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again so that Satan does not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But I say this as a concession, not as a commandment. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For I wish that all men were even as I myself. But each one has his own gift from God, one in this manner and another in that.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But I say to the unmarried and to the widows: It is good for them if they remain even as I am; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>but if they cannot exercise self-control, let them marry. For it is better to marry than to burn <i>with passion.</i></span></p> <h3>
Keep Your Marriage Vows</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Cor-7-10"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Now to the married I command, <i>yet</i> not I but the Lord: A wife is not to depart from <i>her</i> husband. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But even if she does depart, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to <i>her</i> husband. And a husband is not to divorce <i>his</i> wife.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But to the rest I, not the Lord, say: If any brother has a wife who does not believe, and she is willing to live with him, let him not divorce her. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And a woman who has a husband who does not believe, if he is willing to live with her, let her not divorce him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband; otherwise your children would be unclean, but now they are holy. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But if the unbeliever departs, let him depart; a brother or a sister is not under bondage in such <i>cases.</i> But God has called us to peace. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>For how do you know, O wife, whether you will save <i>your</i> husband? Or how do you know, O husband, whether you will save <i>your</i> wife?</span></p> <h3>
Live as You Are Called</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Cor-7-17"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But as God has distributed to each one, as the Lord has called each one, so let him walk. And so I <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>ordain in all the churches. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Was anyone called while circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Was anyone called while uncircumcised? Let him not be circumcised. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing, but keeping the commandments of God <i>is what matters.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Let each one remain in the same calling in which he was called. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Were you called <i>while</i> a slave? Do not be concerned about it; but if you can be made free, rather use <i>it.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>For he who is called in the Lord <i>while</i> a slave is the Lord&#8217;s freedman. Likewise he who is called <i>while</i> free is Christ&#8217;s slave. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of men. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Brethren, let each one remain with God in that <i>state</i> in which he was called.</span></p> <h3>
To the Unmarried and Widows</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Cor-7-25"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Now concerning virgins: I have no commandment from the Lord; yet I give judgment as one whom the Lord in His mercy has made trustworthy. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>I suppose therefore that this is good because of the present distress&#8212;that <i>it is</i> good for a man to remain as he is: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be loosed. Are you loosed from a wife? Do not seek a wife. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>But even if you do marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Nevertheless such will have trouble in the flesh, but I would spare you.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>But this I say, brethren, the time <i>is</i> short, so that from now on even those who have wives should be as though they had none, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>those who weep as though they did not weep, those who rejoice as though they did not rejoice, those who buy as though they did not possess, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>and those who use this world as not misusing <i>it.</i> For the form of this world is passing away.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>But I want you to be without <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>care. He who is unmarried <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>cares for the things of the Lord&#8212;how he may please the Lord. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>But he who is married cares about the things of the world&#8212;how he may please <i>his</i> wife. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>There is a difference between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she who is married cares about the things of the world&#8212;how she may please <i>her</i> husband. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>And this I say for your own profit, not that I may put a leash on you, but for what is proper, and that you may serve the Lord without distraction.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>But if any man thinks he is behaving improperly toward his <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>virgin, if she is past the flower of youth, and thus it must be, let him do what he wishes. He does not sin; let them marry. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>Nevertheless he who stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has power over his own will, and has so determined in his heart that he will keep his <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>virgin, does well. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>So then he who gives <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span><i>her</i> in marriage does well, but he who does not give <i>her</i> in marriage does better.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>A wife is bound by law as long as her husband lives; but if her husband dies, she is at liberty to be married to whom she wishes, only in the Lord. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>But she is happier if she remains as she is, according to my judgment&#8212;and I think I also have the Spirit of God.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-28505a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Corinthians 7:17">1 Corinthians 7:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>direct</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28520b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Corinthians 7:32">1 Corinthians 7:32</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>concern</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28520c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Corinthians 7:32">1 Corinthians 7:32</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>is concerned about</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28524d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Corinthians 7:36">1 Corinthians 7:36</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>virgin daughter</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28525e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Corinthians 7:37">1 Corinthians 7:37</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>virgin daughter</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28526f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Corinthians 7:38">1 Corinthians 7:38</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>his own virgin</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
