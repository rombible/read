<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>I fed you with milk and not with solid food; for until now you were not able <i>to receive it,</i> and even now you are still not able; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>for you are still carnal. For where <i>there are</i> envy, strife, and divisions among you, are you not carnal and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>behaving like <i>mere</i> men? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For when one says, &#8220;I am of Paul,&#8221; and another, &#8220;I <i>am</i> of Apollos,&#8221; are you not carnal?</span></p> <h3>
Watering, Working, Warning</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Cor-3-5"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Who then is Paul, and who <i>is</i> Apollos, but ministers through whom you believed, as the Lord gave to each one? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Now he who plants and he who waters are one, and each one will receive his own reward according to his own labor.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For we are God&#8217;s fellow workers; you are God&#8217;s field, <i>you are</i> God&#8217;s building. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation, and another builds on it. But let each one take heed how he builds on it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For no other foundation can anyone lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now if anyone builds on this foundation <i>with</i> gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>each one&#8217;s work will become clear; for the Day will declare it, because it will be revealed by fire; and the fire will test each one&#8217;s work, of what sort it is. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>If anyone&#8217;s work which he has built on <i>it</i> endures, he will receive a reward. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>If anyone&#8217;s work is burned, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Do you not know that you are the temple of God and <i>that</i> the Spirit of God dwells in you? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>If anyone <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>defiles the temple of God, God will destroy him. For the temple of God is holy, which <i>temple</i> you are.</span></p> <h3>
Avoid Worldly Wisdom</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Cor-3-18"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you seems to be wise in this age, let him become a fool that he may become wise. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, <span class="oblique">&#8220;He catches the wise in their</span> <i>own</i> <span class="oblique">craftiness&#8221;</span>; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>and again, <span class="oblique">&#8220;The</span> <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <span class="oblique">knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are futile.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Therefore let no one boast in men. For all things are yours: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas, or the world or life or death, or things present or things to come&#8212;all are yours. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And you <i>are</i> Christ&#8217;s, and Christ <i>is</i> God&#8217;s.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-28414a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Corinthians 3:3">1 Corinthians 3:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>walking according to man</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28428b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Corinthians 3:17">1 Corinthians 3:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>destroys</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
