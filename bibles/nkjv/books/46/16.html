<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>On the first <i>day</i> of the week let each one of you lay something aside, storing up as he may prosper, that there be no collections when I come. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And when I come, whomever you approve by <i>your</i> letters I will send to bear your gift to Jerusalem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But if it is fitting that I go also, they will go with me.</span></p> <h3>
Personal Plans</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Cor-16-5"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now I will come to you when I pass through Macedonia (for I am passing through Macedonia). </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And it may be that I will remain, or even spend the winter with you, that you may send me on my journey, wherever I go. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For I do not wish to see you now on the way; but I hope to stay a while with you, if the Lord permits.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But I will tarry in Ephesus until Pentecost. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For a great and effective door has opened to me, and <i>there are</i> many adversaries.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And if Timothy comes, see that he may be with you without fear; for he does the work of the Lord, as I also <i>do.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Therefore let no one despise him. But send him on his journey in peace, that he may come to me; for I am waiting for him with the brethren.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now concerning <i>our</i> brother Apollos, I strongly urged him to come to you with the brethren, but he was quite unwilling to come at this time; however, he will come when he has a convenient time.</span></p> <h3>
Final Exhortations</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Cor-16-13"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Watch, stand fast in the faith, be brave, be strong. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Let all <i>that</i> you <i>do</i> be done with love.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>I urge you, brethren&#8212;you know the household of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and <i>that</i> they have devoted themselves to the ministry of the saints&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>that you also submit to such, and to everyone who works and labors with <i>us.</i></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>I am glad about the coming of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus, for what was lacking on your part they supplied. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>For they refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore acknowledge such men.</span></p> <h3>
Greetings and a Solemn Farewell</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Cor-16-19"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>The churches of Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla greet you heartily in the Lord, with the church that is in their house. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>All the brethren greet you.</span></p><p><span class="text 1Cor-16-20">Greet one another with a holy kiss.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>The salutation with my own hand&#8212;Paul&#8217;s.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>If anyone does not love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>accursed. O<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span> Lord, come!</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <i>be</i> with you. </span>
