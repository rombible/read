<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>by which also you are saved, if you hold fast that word which I preached to you&#8212;unless you believed in vain.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and that He was seen by <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>Cephas, then by the twelve. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>After that He was seen by over five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain to the present, but some have <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>fallen asleep. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>After that He was seen by James, then by all the apostles. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then last of all He was seen by me also, as by one born out of due time.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For I am the least of the apostles, who am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all, yet not I, but the grace of God <i>which was</i> with me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Therefore, whether <i>it was</i> I or they, so we preach and so you believed.</span></p> <h3>
The Risen Christ, Our Hope</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Cor-15-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now if Christ is preached that He has been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ is not risen. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And if Christ is not risen, then our preaching <i>is</i> empty and your faith <i>is</i> also empty. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Yes, and we are found false witnesses of God, because we have testified of God that He raised up Christ, whom He did not raise up&#8212;if in fact the dead do not rise. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>For if <i>the</i> dead do not rise, then Christ is not risen. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And if Christ is not risen, your faith <i>is</i> futile; you are still in your sins! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then also those who have <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>fallen asleep in Christ have perished. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men the most pitiable.</span></p> <h3>
The Last Enemy Destroyed</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Cor-15-20"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>But now Christ is risen from the dead, <i>and</i> has become the firstfruits of those who have <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>fallen asleep. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>For since by man <i>came</i> death, by Man also <i>came</i> the resurrection of the dead. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ all shall be made alive. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>But each one in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, afterward those <i>who are</i> Christ&#8217;s at His coming. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then <i>comes</i> the end, when He delivers the kingdom to God the Father, when He puts an end to all rule and all authority and power. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>For He must reign till He has put all enemies under His feet. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>The last enemy <i>that</i> will be destroyed <i>is</i> death. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>For <span class="oblique">&#8220;He has put all things under His feet.&#8221;</span> But when He says &#8220;all things are put under <i>Him,</i>&#8221; <i>it is</i> evident that He who put all things under Him is excepted. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Now when all things are made subject to Him, then the Son Himself will also be subject to Him who put all things under Him, that God may be all in all.</span></p> <h3>
Effects of Denying the Resurrection</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Cor-15-29"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Otherwise, what will they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead do not rise at all? Why then are they baptized for the dead? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And why do we stand in <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>jeopardy every hour? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>I affirm, by the boasting in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>If, in the manner of men, I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantage <i>is it</i> to me? If <i>the</i> dead do not rise, <span class="oblique">&#8220;Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Do not be deceived: &#8220;Evil company corrupts good habits.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Awake to righteousness, and do not sin; for some do not have the knowledge of God. I speak <i>this</i> to your shame.</span></p> <h3>
A Glorious Body</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Cor-15-35"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>But someone will say, &#8220;How are the dead raised up? And with what body do they come?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Foolish one, what you sow is not made alive unless it dies. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>And what you sow, you do not sow that body that shall be, but mere grain&#8212;perhaps wheat or some other <i>grain.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>But God gives it a body as He pleases, and to each seed its own body.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>All flesh <i>is</i> not the same flesh, but <i>there is</i> one <i>kind</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span><i>of</i> flesh of men, another flesh of animals, another of fish, <i>and</i> another of birds.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span><i>There are</i> also <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>celestial bodies and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>terrestrial bodies; but the glory of the celestial <i>is</i> one, and the <i>glory</i> of the terrestrial <i>is</i> another. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span><i>There is</i> one glory of the sun, another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for <i>one</i> star differs from <i>another</i> star in glory.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>So also <i>is</i> the resurrection of the dead. <i>The body</i> is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>And so it is written, <span class="oblique">&#8220;The first man Adam became a living being.&#8221;</span> The last Adam <i>became</i> a life-giving spirit.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span>However, the spiritual is not first, but the natural, and afterward the spiritual. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-47.htm"><b>47</b></a></span>The first man <i>was</i> of the earth, <i>made</i><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span> of dust; the second Man <i>is</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>the Lord from heaven. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-48.htm"><b>48</b></a></span>As <i>was</i> the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span><i>man</i> of dust, so also <i>are</i> those <i>who are made</i> of dust; and as <i>is</i> the heavenly <i>Man,</i> so also <i>are</i> those <i>who are</i> heavenly. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-49.htm"><b>49</b></a></span>And as we have borne the image of the <i>man</i> of dust, we<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[l]</a></span> shall also bear the image of the heavenly <i>Man.</i></span></p> <h3>
Our Final Victory</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Cor-15-50"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-50.htm"><b>50</b></a></span>Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; nor does corruption inherit incorruption. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-51.htm"><b>51</b></a></span>Behold, I tell you a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[m]</a></span>mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-52.htm"><b>52</b></a></span>in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-53.htm"><b>53</b></a></span>For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal <i>must</i> put on immortality. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-54.htm"><b>54</b></a></span>So when this corruptible has put on incorruption, and this mortal has put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written: <span class="oblique">&#8220;Death is swallowed up in victory.&#8221;</span></span></p> <div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line">
