<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Moreover it is required in stewards that one be found faithful. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by a human <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>court. In fact, I do not even judge myself. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For I know of nothing against myself, yet I am not justified by this; but He who judges me is the Lord. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness and reveal the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>counsels of the hearts. Then each one&#8217;s praise will come from God.</span></p> <h3>
Fools for Christ&#8217;s Sake</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Cor-4-6"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now these things, brethren, I have figuratively transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes, that you may learn in us not to think beyond what is written, that none of you may be <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>puffed up on behalf of one against the other. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For who <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>makes you differ <i>from another?</i> And what do you have that you did not receive? Now if you did indeed receive <i>it,</i> why do you boast as if you had not received <i>it?</i></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>You are already full! You are already rich! You have reigned as kings without us&#8212;and indeed I could wish you did reign, that we also might reign with you! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For I think that God has displayed us, the apostles, last, as men condemned to death; for we have been made a spectacle <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>to the world, both to angels and to men. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>We <i>are</i> fools for Christ&#8217;s sake, but you <i>are</i> wise in Christ! We <i>are</i> weak, but you <i>are</i> strong! You <i>are</i> distinguished, but we <i>are</i> dishonored! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>To the present hour we both hunger and thirst, and we are poorly clothed, and beaten, and homeless. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And we labor, working with our own hands. Being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we endure; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>being defamed, we <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>entreat. We have been made as the filth of the world, the offscouring of all things until now.</span></p> <h3>
Paul&#8217;s Paternal Care</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Cor-4-14"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>I do not write these things to shame you, but as my beloved children I warn <i>you.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>For though you might have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet <i>you do</i> not <i>have</i> many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Therefore I urge you, imitate me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>For this reason I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful son in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways in Christ, as I teach everywhere in every church.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Now some are <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>puffed up, as though I were not coming to you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord wills, and I will know, not the word of those who are puffed up, but the power. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>For the kingdom of God <i>is</i> not in word but in power. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness?</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-28437a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Corinthians 4:3">1 Corinthians 4:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>day</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28439b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Corinthians 4:5">1 Corinthians 4:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>motives</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28440c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Corinthians 4:6">1 Corinthians 4:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>arrogant</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28441d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Corinthians 4:7">1 Corinthians 4:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>distinguishes you</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28443e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Corinthians 4:9">1 Corinthians 4:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>theater</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28447f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Corinthians 4:13">1 Corinthians 4:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>exhort, encourage</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28452g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Corinthians 4:18">1 Corinthians 4:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>arrogant</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
