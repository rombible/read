<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>all ate the same spiritual food, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them, and that Rock was Christ. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But with most of them God was not well pleased, for <i>their bodies</i> were scattered in the wilderness.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now these things became our examples, to the intent that we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And do not become idolaters as <i>were</i> some of them. As it is written, <span class="oblique">&#8220;The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Nor let us commit sexual immorality, as some of them did, and in one day twenty-three thousand fell; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>nor let us <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed by serpents; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>nor complain, as some of them also complained, and were destroyed by the destroyer. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>all these things happened to them as examples, and they were written for our <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages have come.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Therefore let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man; but God <i>is</i> faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will also make the way of escape, that you may be able to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>bear <i>it.</i></span></p> <h3>
Flee from Idolatry</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Cor-10-14"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>I speak as to wise men; judge for yourselves what I say. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>For we, <i>though</i> many, are one bread <i>and</i> one body; for we all partake of that one bread.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Observe Israel after the flesh: Are not those who eat of the sacrifices <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>partakers of the altar? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>What am I saying then? That an idol is anything, or what is offered to idols is anything? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Rather, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice to demons and not to God, and I do not want you to have fellowship with demons. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons; you cannot partake of the Lord&#8217;s table and of the table of demons. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than He?</span></p> <h3>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>If any of those who do not believe invites you <i>to dinner,</i> and you desire to go, eat whatever is set before you, asking no question for conscience&#8217; sake. </span>
