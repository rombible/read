<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>For he who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God, for no one understands <i>him;</i> however, in the spirit he speaks mysteries. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But he who prophesies speaks edification and exhortation and comfort to men. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the church. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>I wish you all spoke with tongues, but even more that you prophesied; <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>for he who prophesies <i>is</i> greater than he who speaks with tongues, unless indeed he interprets, that the church may receive edification.</span></p> <h3>
Tongues Must Be Interpreted</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Cor-14-6"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you unless I speak to you either by revelation, by knowledge, by prophesying, or by teaching? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Even things without life, whether flute or harp, when they make a sound, unless they make a distinction in the sounds, how will it be known what is piped or played? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For if the trumpet makes an uncertain sound, who will prepare for battle? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So likewise you, unless you utter by the tongue words easy to understand, how will it be known what is spoken? For you will be speaking into the air. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>There are, it may be, so many kinds of languages in the world, and none of them <i>is</i> without <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>significance. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Therefore, if I do not know the meaning of the language, I shall be a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>foreigner to him who speaks, and he who speaks <i>will be</i> a foreigner to me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Even so you, since you are <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>zealous for spiritual <i>gifts, let it be</i> for the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>edification of the church <i>that</i> you seek to excel.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Therefore let him who speaks in a tongue pray that he may interpret. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>What is <i>the conclusion</i> then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will also pray with the understanding. I will sing with the spirit, and I will also sing with the understanding. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Otherwise, if you bless with the spirit, how will he who occupies the place of the uninformed say &#8220;Amen&#8221; at your giving of thanks, since he does not understand what you say? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>For you indeed give thanks well, but the other is not edified.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>I thank my God I speak with tongues more than you all; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>yet in the church I would rather speak five words with my understanding, that I may teach others also, than ten thousand words in a tongue.</span></p> <h3>
Tongues a Sign to Unbelievers</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Cor-14-20"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Brethren, do not be children in understanding; however, in malice be babes, but in understanding be mature.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>In the law it is written:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text 1Cor-14-21"><span class="oblique">&#8220;With</span> <i>men of</i> <span class="oblique">other tongues and other lips</span></span><br /><span class="text 1Cor-14-21"><span class="oblique">I will speak to this people;</span></span><br /><span class="text 1Cor-14-21"><span class="oblique">And yet, for all that, they will not hear Me,&#8221;</span></span></p></div><p class="first-line-none top-1"><span class="text 1Cor-14-21">says the Lord.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Therefore tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe but to unbelievers; but prophesying is not for unbelievers but for those who believe. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Therefore if the whole church comes together in one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in <i>those who are</i> uninformed or unbelievers, will they not say that you are <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>out of your mind? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or an uninformed person comes in, he is convinced by all, he is convicted by all. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>And thus the secrets of his heart are revealed; and so, falling down on <i>his</i> face, he will worship God and report that God is truly among you.</span></p> <h3>
Order in Church Meetings</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Cor-14-26"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>How is it then, brethren? Whenever you come together, each of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>edification. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>If anyone speaks in a tongue, <i>let there be</i> two or at the most three, <i>each</i> in turn, and let one interpret. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>But if there is no interpreter, let him keep silent in church, and let him speak to himself and to God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others judge. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>But if <i>anything</i> is revealed to another who sits by, let the first keep silent. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>For you can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn and all may be encouraged. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>For God is not <i>the author</i> of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>confusion but of peace, as in all the churches of the saints.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Let <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>your women keep silent in the churches, for they are not permitted to speak; but <i>they are</i> to be submissive, as the law also says. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>And if they want to learn something, let them ask their own husbands at home; for it is shameful for women to speak in church.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Or did the word of God come <i>originally</i> from you? Or <i>was it</i> you only that it reached? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>If anyone thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things which I write to you are the commandments of the Lord. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>But <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span>if anyone is ignorant, let him be ignorant.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>Therefore, brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy, and do not forbid to speak with tongues. </span>
