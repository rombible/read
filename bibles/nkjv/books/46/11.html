Head Coverings</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Cor-11-2"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Now I praise you, brethren, that you remember me in all things and keep the traditions just as I delivered <i>them</i> to you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But I want you to know that the head of every man is Christ, the head of woman <i>is</i> man, and the head of Christ <i>is</i> God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Every man praying or prophesying, having <i>his</i> head covered, dishonors his head. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But every woman who prays or prophesies with <i>her</i> head uncovered dishonors her head, for that is one and the same as if her head were shaved. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>For if a woman is not covered, let her also be shorn. But if it is shameful for a woman to be shorn or shaved, let her be covered. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For a man indeed ought not to cover <i>his</i> head, since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For man is not from woman, but woman from man. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Nor was man created for the woman, but woman for the man. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For this reason the woman ought to have <i>a symbol of</i> authority on <i>her</i> head, because of the angels. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Nevertheless, neither <i>is</i> man independent of woman, nor woman independent of man, in the Lord. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>For as woman <i>came</i> from man, even so man also <i>comes</i> through woman; but all things are from God.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Judge among yourselves. Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her; for <i>her</i> hair is given <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>to her for a covering. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But if anyone seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor <i>do</i> the churches of God.</span></p> <h3>
Conduct at the Lord&#8217;s Supper</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Cor-11-17"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Now in giving these instructions I do not praise <i>you,</i> since you come together not for the better but for the worse. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>For first of all, when you come together as a church, I hear that there are divisions among you, and in part I believe it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>For there must also be factions among you, that those who are approved may be <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>recognized among you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Therefore when you come together in one place, it is not to eat the Lord&#8217;s Supper. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>For in eating, each one takes his own supper ahead of <i>others;</i> and one is hungry and another is drunk. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>What! Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and shame <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you in this? I do not praise <i>you.</i></span></p> <h3>
Institution of the Lord&#8217;s Supper</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Cor-11-23"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you: that the Lord Jesus on the <i>same</i> night in which He was betrayed took bread; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>and when He had given thanks, He broke <i>it</i> and said, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;Take, eat; this is My body which is</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span><span class="woj">broken for you; do this in remembrance of Me.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>In the same manner <i>He</i> also <i>took</i> the cup after supper, saying, <span class="woj">&#8220;This cup is the new covenant in My blood. This do, as often as you drink <i>it,</i> in remembrance of Me.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord&#8217;s death till He comes.</span></p> <h3>
Examine Yourself</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Cor-11-27"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks <i>this</i> cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>blood of the Lord. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>For he who eats and drinks <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>in an unworthy manner eats and drinks judgment to himself, not discerning the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>Lord&#8217;s body. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>For this reason many <i>are</i> weak and sick among you, and many <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>sleep. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>For if we would judge ourselves, we would not be judged. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>But when we are judged, we are chastened by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Therefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for one another. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>But if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, lest you come together for judgment. And the rest I will set in order when I come.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-28616a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Corinthians 11:15">1 Corinthians 11:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'>M omits <i>to her</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28620b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Corinthians 11:19">1 Corinthians 11:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>manifest, evident</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28623c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Corinthians 11:22">1 Corinthians 11:22</span> <span class='footnote-text'>The poor</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28625d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Corinthians 11:24">1 Corinthians 11:24</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>Take, eat</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28625e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Corinthians 11:24">1 Corinthians 11:24</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>broken</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28628f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Corinthians 11:27">1 Corinthians 11:27</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M <i>the blood</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28630g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Corinthians 11:29">1 Corinthians 11:29</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>in an unworthy manner</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28630h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Corinthians 11:29">1 Corinthians 11:29</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>Lord&#8217;s</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28631i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Corinthians 11:30">1 Corinthians 11:30</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Are dead</span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
