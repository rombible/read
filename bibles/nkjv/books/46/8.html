Knowledge <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>puffs up, but love <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>edifies. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And if anyone thinks that he knows anything, he knows nothing yet as he ought to know. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But if anyone loves God, this one is known by Him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Therefore concerning the eating of things offered to idols, we know that an idol <i>is</i> nothing in the world, and that <i>there is</i> no other God but one. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as there are many gods and many lords), </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>yet for us <i>there is</i> one God, the Father, of whom <i>are</i> all things, and we for Him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom <i>are</i> all things, and through whom we <i>live.</i></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>However, <i>there is</i> not in everyone that knowledge; for some, with consciousness of the idol, until now eat <i>it</i> as a thing offered to an idol; and their conscience, being weak, is defiled. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But food does not commend us to God; for neither if we eat are we the better, nor if we do not eat are we the worse.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But beware lest somehow this liberty of yours become a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>stumbling block to those who are weak. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For if anyone sees you who have knowledge eating in an idol&#8217;s temple, will not the conscience of him who is weak be emboldened to eat those things offered to idols? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And because of your knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But when you thus sin against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Therefore, if food makes my brother stumble, I will never again eat meat, lest I make my brother stumble.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-28529a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Corinthians 8:1">1 Corinthians 8:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>makes arrogant</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28529b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Corinthians 8:1">1 Corinthians 8:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>builds up</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28537c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Corinthians 8:9">1 Corinthians 8:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>cause of offense</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
