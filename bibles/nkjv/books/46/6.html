<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world will be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Do you not know that we shall judge angels? How much more, things that pertain to this life? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>If then you have <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>judgments concerning things pertaining to this life, do you appoint those who are least esteemed by the church to judge? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>I say this to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you, not even one, who will be able to judge between his brethren? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But brother goes to law against brother, and that before unbelievers!</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now therefore, it is already an utter failure for you that you go to law against one another. Why do you not rather accept wrong? Why do you not rather <i>let yourselves</i> be cheated? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>No, you yourselves do wrong and cheat, and <i>you do</i> these things <i>to your</i> brethren! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>homosexuals, nor <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>sodomites, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And such were some of you. But you were washed, but you were <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God.</span></p> <h3>
Glorify God in Body and Spirit</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Cor-6-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>All things are lawful for me, but all things are not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>helpful. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>any. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Foods for the stomach and the stomach for foods, but God will destroy both it and them. Now the body <i>is</i> not for sexual immorality but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And God both raised up the Lord and will also raise us up by His power.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make <i>them</i> members of a harlot? Certainly not! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Or do you not know that he who is joined to a harlot is one body <i>with her?</i> For <span class="oblique">&#8220;the two,&#8221;</span> He says, <span class="oblique">&#8220;shall become one flesh.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit <i>with Him.</i></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Flee sexual immorality. Every sin that a man does is outside the body, but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit <i>who is</i> in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own? </span>
