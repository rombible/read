<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And you are <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he who has done this deed might be taken away from among you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For I indeed, as absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged (as though I were present) him who has so done this deed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together, along with my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Jesus.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Your glorying <i>is</i> not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Therefore <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>purge out the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, since you truly are unleavened. For indeed Christ, our Passover, was sacrificed <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>for us. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened <i>bread</i> of sincerity and truth.</span></p> <h3>
Immorality Must Be Judged</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Cor-5-9"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>I wrote to you in my epistle not to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>keep company with sexually immoral people. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Yet <i>I</i> certainly <i>did</i> not <i>mean</i> with the sexually immoral people of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or idolaters, since then you would need to go out of the world. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But now I have written to you not to keep company with anyone named a brother, who is sexually immoral, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner&#8212;not even to eat with such a person.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>For what <i>have</i> I <i>to do</i> with judging those also who are outside? Do you not judge those who are inside? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>But those who are outside God judges. Therefore <span class="oblique">&#8220;put away from yourselves the evil person.&#8221;</span></span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-28456a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Corinthians 5:1">1 Corinthians 5:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>named</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28457b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Corinthians 5:2">1 Corinthians 5:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>arrogant</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28460c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Corinthians 5:5">1 Corinthians 5:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>Jesus</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28462d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Corinthians 5:7">1 Corinthians 5:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>clean out</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28462e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Corinthians 5:7">1 Corinthians 5:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>for us</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28464f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Corinthians 5:9">1 Corinthians 5:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>associate</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
