<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then David said, &#8220;No one may carry the ark of God but the Levites, for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has chosen them to carry the ark of God and to minister before Him forever.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And David gathered all Israel together at Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> to its place, which he had prepared for it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then David assembled the children of Aaron and the Levites: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, and one hundred and twenty of his <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>brethren; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, and two hundred and twenty of his brethren; </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief, and two hundred of his brethren; </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, and one hundred and twelve of his brethren.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites: for Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>He said to them, &#8220;You <i>are</i> the heads of the fathers&#8217; <i>houses</i> of the Levites; <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>sanctify yourselves, you and your brethren, that you may bring up the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel to <i>the place</i> I have prepared for it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For because you <i>did</i> not <i>do it</i> the first <i>time,</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God broke out against us, because we did not consult Him <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>about the proper order.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So the priests and the Levites <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And the children of the Levites bore the ark of God on their shoulders, by its poles, as Moses had commanded according to the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then David spoke to the leaders of the Levites to appoint their brethren <i>to be</i> the singers accompanied by instruments of music, stringed instruments, harps, and cymbals, by raising the voice with resounding joy. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of their brethren, the sons of Merari, Ethan the son of Kushaiah; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>and with them their brethren of the second <i>rank:</i> Zechariah, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>Ben, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Elipheleh, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, the gatekeepers; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, <i>were</i> to sound the cymbals of bronze; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Zechariah, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with strings according to Alamoth; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Mattithiah, Elipheleh, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah, to direct with harps on the Sheminith; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Chenaniah, leader of the Levites, was instructor <i>in charge of</i> the music, because he <i>was</i> skillful; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Berechiah and Elkanah <i>were</i> doorkeepers for the ark; </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>So David, the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> from the house of Obed-Edom with joy. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And so it was, when God helped the Levites who bore the ark of the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, that they offered seven bulls and seven rams. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, as were all the Levites who bore the ark, the singers, and Chenaniah the music master <i>with</i> the singers. David also wore a linen ephod. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> with shouting and with the sound of the horn, with trumpets and with cymbals, making music with stringed instruments and harps.</span></p> <p>
