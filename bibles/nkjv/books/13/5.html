<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>They made war with the Hagrites, Jetur, Naphish, and Nodab. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And they were helped against them, and the Hagrites were delivered into their hand, and all who <i>were</i> with them, for they cried out to God in the battle.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then they took away their livestock&#8212;fifty thousand of their camels, two hundred and fifty thousand of their sheep, and two thousand of their donkeys&#8212;also one hundred thousand of their men; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>for many fell dead, because the war <i>was</i> God&#8217;s. And they dwelt in their place until the captivity.</span></p> <h3>
