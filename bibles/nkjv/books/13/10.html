<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then the Philistines followed hard after Saul and his sons. And the Philistines killed Jonathan, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>Abinadab, and Malchishua, Saul&#8217;s sons. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>The battle became fierce against Saul. The archers hit him, and he was wounded by the archers. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then Saul said to his armorbearer, &#8220;Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised men come and abuse me.&#8221; But his armorbearer would not, for he was greatly afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword and fell on it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And when his armorbearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his sword and died. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So Saul and his three sons died, and all his house died together. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And when all the men of Israel who <i>were</i> in the valley saw that they had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook their cities and fled; then the Philistines came and dwelt in them.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/10-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So it happened the next day, when the Philistines came to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And they stripped him and took his head and his armor, and sent word throughout the land of the Philistines to proclaim the news <i>in the temple</i> of their idols and among the people. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then they put his armor in the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>temple of their gods, and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/10-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And when all Jabesh Gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/10-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>all the valiant men arose and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons; and they brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the tamarisk tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/10-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So Saul died for his unfaithfulness which he had <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>committed against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, because he did not keep the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and also because he consulted a medium for guidance. </span>
