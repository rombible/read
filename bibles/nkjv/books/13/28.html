<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then King David rose to his feet and said, &#8220;Hear me, my brethren and my people: I <i>had</i> it in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and for the footstool of our God, and had made preparations to build it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But God said to me, &#8216;You shall not build a house for My name, because you <i>have been</i> a man of war and have shed blood.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>However the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel chose me above all the house of my father to be king over Israel forever, for He has chosen Judah <i>to be</i> the ruler. And of the house of Judah, the house of my father, and among the sons of my father, He was pleased with me to make <i>me</i> king over all Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And of all my sons (for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has given me many sons) He has chosen my son Solomon to sit on the throne of the kingdom of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> over Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now He said to me, &#8216;It is your son Solomon <i>who</i> shall build My house and My courts; for I have chosen him <i>to be</i> My son, and I will be his Father. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Moreover I will establish his kingdom forever, if he is steadfast to observe My commandments and My judgments, as it is this day.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Now therefore, in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and in the hearing of our God, be careful to seek out all the commandments of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God, that you may possess this good land, and leave <i>it</i> as an inheritance for your children after you forever.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;As for you, my son Solomon, know the God of your father, and serve Him with a loyal heart and with a willing mind; for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> searches all hearts and understands all the intent of the thoughts. If you seek Him, He will be found by you; but if you forsake Him, He will cast you off forever. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Consider now, for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary; be strong, and do it.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then David gave his son Solomon the plans for the vestibule, its houses, its treasuries, its upper chambers, its inner chambers, and the place of the mercy seat; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>and the plans for all that he had by the Spirit, of the courts of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, of all the chambers all around, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries for the dedicated things; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>also for the division of the priests and the Levites, for all the work of the service of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and for all the articles of service in the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span><i>He gave</i> gold by weight for <i>things</i> of gold, for all articles used in every kind of service; also <i>silver</i> for all articles of silver by weight, for all articles used in every kind of service; </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And by weight <i>he gave</i> gold for the tables of the showbread, for each table, and silver for the tables of silver; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>also pure gold for the forks, the basins, the pitchers of pure gold, and the golden bowls&#8212;<i>he gave gold</i> by weight for every bowl; and for the silver bowls, <i>silver</i> by weight for every bowl; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>and refined gold by weight for the altar of incense, and for the construction of the chariot, that is, the gold cherubim that spread <i>their wings</i> and overshadowed the ark of the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span>
