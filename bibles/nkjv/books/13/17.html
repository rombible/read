<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then Nathan said to David, &#8220;Do all that <i>is</i> in your heart, for God <i>is</i> with you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But it happened that night that the word of God came to Nathan, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8220;Go and tell My servant David, &#8216;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8220;You shall not build Me a house to dwell in. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For I have not dwelt in a house since the time that I brought up Israel, even to this day, but have gone from tent to tent, and from <i>one</i> tabernacle <i>to another.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Wherever I have moved about with all Israel, have I ever spoken a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd My people, saying, &#8216;Why have you not built Me a house of cedar?&#8217; &#8221; &#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now therefore, thus shall you say to My servant David, &#8216;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts: &#8220;I took you from the sheepfold, from following the sheep, to be <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>ruler over My people Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have cut off all your enemies from before you, and have <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>made you a name like the name of the great men who <i>are</i> on the earth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Moreover I will appoint a place for My people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own and move no more; nor shall the sons of wickedness oppress them anymore, as previously, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>since the time that I commanded judges <i>to be</i> over My people Israel. Also I will subdue all your enemies. Furthermore I tell you that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will build you a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>house. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And it shall be, when your days are fulfilled, when you must <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>go <i>to be</i> with your fathers, that I will set up your seed after you, who will be of your sons; and I will establish his kingdom. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>He shall build Me a house, and I will establish his throne forever. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>I will be his Father, and he shall be My son; and I will not take My mercy away from him, as I took <i>it</i> from <i>him</i> who was before you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And I will establish him in My house and in My kingdom forever; and his throne shall be established forever.&#8221; &#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>According to all these words and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then King David went in and sat before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; and he said: &#8220;Who <i>am</i> I, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God? And what is my house, that You have brought me this far? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And <i>yet</i> this was a small thing in Your sight, O God; and You have <i>also</i> spoken of Your servant&#8217;s house for a great while to come, and have regarded me according to the rank of a man of high degree, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>What more can David <i>say</i> to You for the honor of Your servant? For You know Your servant. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, for Your servant&#8217;s sake, and according to Your own heart, You have done all this greatness, in making known all these great things. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, <i>there is</i> none like You, nor <i>is there any</i> God besides You, according to all that we have heard with our ears. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And who <i>is</i> like Your people Israel, the one nation on the earth whom God went to redeem for Himself <i>as</i> a people&#8212;to make for Yourself a name by great and awesome deeds, by driving out nations from before Your people whom You redeemed from Egypt? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>For You have made Your people Israel Your very own people forever; and You, <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, have become their God.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>&#8220;And now, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, the word which You have spoken concerning Your servant and concerning his house, <i>let it</i> be established forever, and do as You have said. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>So let it be established, that Your name may be magnified forever, saying, &#8216;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts, the God of Israel, <i>is</i> Israel&#8217;s God.&#8217; And let the house of Your servant David be established before You. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>For You, O my God, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>have revealed to Your servant that You will build him a house.
