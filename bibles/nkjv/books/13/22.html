<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So David commanded to gather the aliens who <i>were</i> in the land of Israel; and he appointed masons to cut hewn stones to build the house of God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails of the doors of the gates and for the joints, and bronze in abundance beyond measure, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and cedar trees in abundance; for the Sidonians and those from Tyre brought much cedar wood to David.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now David said, &#8220;Solomon my son <i>is</i> young and inexperienced, and the house to be built for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>must be</i> exceedingly magnificent, famous and glorious throughout all countries. I will now make preparation for it.&#8221; So David made abundant preparations before his death.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then he called for his son Solomon, and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>charged him to build a house for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And David said to Solomon: &#8220;My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build a house to the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> my God; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>but the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came to me, saying, &#8216;You have shed much blood and have made great wars; you shall not build a house for My name, because you have shed much blood on the earth in My sight. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies all around. His name shall be <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>Solomon, for I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>He shall build a house for My name, and he shall be My son, and I <i>will be</i> his Father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now, my son, may the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> be with you; and may you prosper, and build the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God, as He has said to you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Only may the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> give you wisdom and understanding, and give you charge concerning Israel, that you may keep the law of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then you will prosper, if you take care to fulfill the statutes and judgments with which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>charged Moses concerning Israel. Be strong and of good courage; do not fear nor be dismayed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Indeed I have taken much trouble to prepare for the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> one hundred thousand talents of gold and one million talents of silver, and bronze and iron beyond measure, for it is so abundant. I have prepared timber and stone also, and you may add to them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Moreover <i>there are</i> workmen with you in abundance: woodsmen and stonecutters, and all types of skillful men for every kind of work. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Of gold and silver and bronze and iron <i>there is</i> no limit. Arise and begin working, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> be with you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>David also commanded all the leaders of Israel to help Solomon his son, <i>saying,</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>&#8220;<i>Is</i> not the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God with you? And has He <i>not</i> given you rest on every side? For He has given the inhabitants of the land into my hand, and the land is subdued before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and before His people. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Now set your heart and your soul to seek the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God. Therefore arise and build the sanctuary of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God, to bring the ark of the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and the holy articles of God into the house that is to be built for the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-10971a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Chronicles 22:6">1 Chronicles 22:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>com-manded</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-10974b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Chronicles 22:9">1 Chronicles 22:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Peaceful</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-10978c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Chronicles 22:13">1 Chronicles 22:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>commanded</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
