<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Ezer the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third, </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>These <i>are</i> the ones who crossed the Jordan in the first month, when it had overflowed all its banks; and they put to flight all <i>those</i> in the valleys, to the east and to the west.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then some of the sons of Benjamin and Judah came to David at the stronghold. </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>When he went to Ziklag, those of Manasseh who defected to him were Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, captains of the thousands who <i>were</i> from Manasseh. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And they helped David against the bands <i>of raiders,</i> for they <i>were</i> all mighty men of valor, and they were captains in the army. </span>
