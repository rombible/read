<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then David said, &#8220;I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me.&#8221; So David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. And David&#8217;s servants came to Hanun in the land of the people of Ammon to comfort him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And the princes of the people of Ammon said to Hanun, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>&#8220;Do you think that David really honors your father because he has sent comforters to you? Did his servants not come to you to search and to overthrow and to spy out the land?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Therefore Hanun took David&#8217;s servants, shaved them, and cut off their garments <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>in the middle, at their buttocks, and sent them away. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then <i>some</i> went and told David about the men; and he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, &#8220;Wait at Jericho until your beards have grown, and <i>then</i> return.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>When the people of Ammon saw that they had made themselves repulsive to David, Hanun and the people of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire for themselves chariots and horsemen from <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Mesopotamia, from Syrian Maacah, and from <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>Zobah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So they hired for themselves thirty-two thousand chariots, with the king of Maacah and his people, who came and encamped before Medeba. Also the people of Ammon gathered together from their cities, and came to battle.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Now when David heard <i>of it,</i> he sent Joab and all the army of the mighty men. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then the people of Ammon came out and put themselves in battle array before the gate of the city, and the kings who had come <i>were</i> by themselves in the field.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>When Joab saw that the battle line was against him before and behind, he chose some of Israel&#8217;s best and put <i>them</i> in battle array against the Syrians. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And the rest of the people he put under the command of Abishai his brother, and they set <i>themselves</i> in battle array against the people of Ammon. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then he said, &#8220;If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the people of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will help you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Be of good courage, and let us be strong for our people and for the cities of our God. And may the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> do <i>what is</i> good in His sight.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So Joab and the people who <i>were</i> with him drew near for the battle against the Syrians, and they fled before him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>When the people of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fleeing, they also fled before Abishai his brother, and entered the city. So Joab went to Jerusalem.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Now when the Syrians saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they sent messengers and brought the Syrians who were beyond <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>the River, and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>Shophach the commander of Hadadezer&#8217;s army <i>went</i> before them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>When it was told David, he gathered all Israel, crossed over the Jordan and came upon them, and set up in battle array against them. So when David had set up in battle array against the Syrians, they fought with him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then the Syrians fled before Israel; and David killed <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>seven thousand charioteers and forty thousand <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>foot soldiers of the Syrians, and killed Shophach the commander of the army. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And when the servants of Hadadezer saw that they were defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and became his servants. So the Syrians were not willing to help the people of Ammon anymore.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-10911a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Chronicles 19:3">1 Chronicles 19:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>In your eyes is David honoring your father because</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-10912b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Chronicles 19:4">1 Chronicles 19:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>in half</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-10914c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Chronicles 19:6">1 Chronicles 19:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. <i>Aram Naharaim</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-10914d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Chronicles 19:6">1 Chronicles 19:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Zoba,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Sam.10.6" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Sam.10.6&amp;version=NKJV">2 Sam. 10:6</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-10924e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Chronicles 19:16">1 Chronicles 19:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>The Euphrates</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-10924f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Chronicles 19:16">1 Chronicles 19:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Zoba,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Sam.10.6" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Sam.10.6&amp;version=NKJV">2 Sam. 10:6</span>, or <i>Shobach,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Sam.10.16" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Sam.10.16&amp;version=NKJV">2 Sam. 10:16</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-10926g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Chronicles 19:18">1 Chronicles 19:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>seven hundred,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Sam.10.18" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Sam.10.18&amp;version=NKJV">2 Sam. 10:18</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-10926h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Chronicles 19:18">1 Chronicles 19:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>horsemen,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Sam.10.18" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Sam.10.18&amp;version=NKJV">2 Sam. 10:18</span></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
