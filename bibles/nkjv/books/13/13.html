<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And David said to all the assembly of Israel, &#8220;If <i>it seems</i> good to you, and if it is of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> our God, let us send out to our brethren everywhere <i>who are</i> left in all the land of Israel, and with them to the priests and Levites <i>who are</i> in their cities <i>and</i> their common-lands, that they may gather together to us; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and let us bring the ark of our God back to us, for we have not inquired at it since the days of Saul.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then all the assembly said that they would do so, for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor in Egypt to as far as the entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjath Jearim. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And David and all Israel went up to Baalah,<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span> to Kirjath Jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, who dwells <i>between</i> the cherubim, where <i>His</i> name is proclaimed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So they <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>carried the ark of God on a new cart from the house of Abinadab, and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then David and all Israel played <i>music</i> before God with all <i>their</i> might, with <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>singing, on harps, on stringed instruments, on tambourines, on cymbals, and with trumpets.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And when they came to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>Chidon&#8217;s threshing floor, Uzza put out his hand to hold the ark, for the oxen <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>stumbled. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then the anger of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was aroused against Uzza, and He struck him because he put his hand to the ark; and he died there before God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And David became angry because of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s outbreak against Uzza; therefore that place is called <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>Perez Uzza to this day. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>David was afraid of God that day, saying, &#8220;How can I bring the ark of God to me?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So David would not move the ark with him into the City of David, but took it aside into the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>The ark of God remained with the family of Obed-Edom in his house three months. And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> blessed the house of Obed-Edom and all that he had.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-10767a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Chronicles 13:6">1 Chronicles 13:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Baale Judah,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Sam.6.2" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Sam.6.2&amp;version=NKJV">2 Sam. 6:2</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-10768b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Chronicles 13:7">1 Chronicles 13:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>caused the ark of God to ride</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-10769c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Chronicles 13:8">1 Chronicles 13:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>songs</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-10770d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Chronicles 13:9">1 Chronicles 13:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Nachon,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Sam.6.6" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Sam.6.6&amp;version=NKJV">2 Sam. 6:6</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-10770e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Chronicles 13:9">1 Chronicles 13:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>let it go off</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-10772f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Chronicles 13:11">1 Chronicles 13:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Outburst Against Uzza</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
