<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So David said to Joab and to the leaders of the people, &#8220;Go, number Israel from Beersheba to Dan, and bring the number of them to me that I may know <i>it.</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And Joab answered, &#8220;May the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> make His people a hundred times more than they are. But, my lord the king, <i>are</i> they not all my lord&#8217;s servants? Why then does my lord require this thing? Why should he be a cause of guilt in Israel?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Nevertheless the king&#8217;s word prevailed against Joab. Therefore Joab departed and went throughout all Israel and came to Jerusalem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then Joab gave the sum of the number of the people to David. All Israel <i>had</i> one million one hundred thousand men who drew the sword, and Judah <i>had</i> four hundred and seventy thousand men who drew the sword. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But he did not count Levi and Benjamin among them, for the king&#8217;s <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>word was abominable to Joab.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>God was displeased with this thing; therefore He struck Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So David said to God, &#8220;I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing; but now, I pray, take away the iniquity of Your servant, for I have done very foolishly.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> spoke to Gad, David&#8217;s seer, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8220;Go and tell David, saying, &#8216;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8220;I offer you three <i>things;</i> choose one of them for yourself, that I may do <i>it</i> to you.&#8221; &#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So Gad came to David and said to him, &#8220;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8216;Choose for yourself, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>either <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>three years of famine, or three months to be defeated by your foes with the sword of your enemies overtaking <i>you,</i> or else for three days the sword of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8212;the plague in the land, with the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> destroying throughout all the territory of Israel.&#8217; Now consider what answer I should take back to Him who sent me.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And David said to Gad, &#8220;I am in great distress. Please let me fall into the hand of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, for His mercies <i>are</i> very great; but do not let me fall into the hand of man.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> sent a plague upon Israel, and seventy thousand men of Israel fell. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And God sent <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it. As <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>he was destroying, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> looked and relented of the disaster, and said to the angel who was destroying, &#8220;It is enough; now restrain <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>your hand.&#8221; And the angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> stood by the threshing floor of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>Ornan the Jebusite.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then David lifted his eyes and saw the angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> standing between earth and heaven, having in his hand a drawn sword stretched out over Jerusalem. So David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And David said to God, &#8220;Was it not I who commanded the people to be numbered? I am the one who has sinned and done evil indeed; but these sheep, what have they done? Let Your hand, I pray, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> my God, be against me and my father&#8217;s house, but not against Your people that they should be plagued.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Therefore, the angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> commanded Gad to say to David that David should go and erect an altar to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>So David went up at the word of Gad, which he had spoken in the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Now Ornan turned and saw the angel; and his four sons <i>who were</i> with him hid themselves, but Ornan continued threshing wheat. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>So David came to Ornan, and Ornan looked and saw David. And he went out from the threshing floor, and bowed before David with <i>his</i> face to the ground. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then David said to Ornan, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>&#8220;Grant me the place of <i>this</i> threshing floor, that I may build an altar on it to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. You shall grant it to me at the full price, that the plague may be withdrawn from the people.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>But Ornan said to David, &#8220;Take <i>it</i> to yourself, and let my lord the king do <i>what is</i> good in his eyes. Look, I <i>also</i> give <i>you</i> the oxen for burnt offerings, the threshing implements for wood, and the wheat for the grain offering; I give <i>it</i> all.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then King David said to Ornan, &#8220;No, but I will surely buy <i>it</i> for the full price, for I will not take what is yours for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, nor offer burnt offerings with <i>that which</i> costs <i>me</i> nothing.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>So David gave Ornan six hundred shekels of gold by weight for the place. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And David built there an altar to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called on the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; and He answered him from heaven by fire on the altar of burnt offering.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> commanded the angel, and he returned his sword to its sheath.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>At that time, when David saw that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had answered him on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he sacrificed there. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>For the tabernacle of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and the altar of the burnt offering, which Moses had made in the wilderness, <i>were</i> at that time at the high place in Gibeon. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>But David could not go before it to inquire of God, for he was afraid of the sword of the angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-10936a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Chronicles 21:1">1 Chronicles 21:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>take a census of</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-10941b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Chronicles 21:6">1 Chronicles 21:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>command</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-10942c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Chronicles 21:7">1 Chronicles 21:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>it was evil in the eyes of God</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-10947d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Chronicles 21:12">1 Chronicles 21:12</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>seven,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Sam.24.13" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Sam.24.13&amp;version=NKJV">2 Sam. 24:13</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-10947e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Chronicles 21:12">1 Chronicles 21:12</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>Angel,</i> and so throughout the chapter</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-10950f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Chronicles 21:15">1 Chronicles 21:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>the Angel</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-10950g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Chronicles 21:15">1 Chronicles 21:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>He</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-10950h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Chronicles 21:15">1 Chronicles 21:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>Your</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-10950i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Chronicles 21:15">1 Chronicles 21:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Araunah,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Sam.24.16" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Sam.24.16&amp;version=NKJV">2 Sam. 24:16</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Sam.24.18-2Sam.24.24" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Sam.24.18-2Sam.24.24&amp;version=NKJV">18&#8211;24</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-10957j"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 1 Chronicles 21:22">1 Chronicles 21:22</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Give</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
