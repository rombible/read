<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>As they ministered to the Lord and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, &#8220;Now separate to Me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then, having fasted and prayed, and laid hands on them, they sent <i>them</i> away.</span></p> <h3>
Preaching in Cyprus</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-13-4"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia, and from there they sailed to Cyprus. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And when they arrived in Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. They also had John as <i>their</i> assistant.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now when they had gone through <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>the island to Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew whose name <i>was</i> Bar-Jesus, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. This man called for Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But Elymas the sorcerer (for so his name is translated) <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>withstood them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then Saul, who also <i>is called</i> Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently at him </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and said, &#8220;O full of all deceit and all fraud, <i>you</i> son of the devil, <i>you</i> enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease perverting the straight ways of the Lord? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And now, indeed, the hand of the Lord <i>is</i> upon you, and you shall be blind, not seeing the sun for a time.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Acts-13-11">And immediately a dark mist fell on him, and he went around seeking someone to lead him by the hand. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then the proconsul believed, when he saw what had been done, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.</span></p> <h3>
At Antioch in Pisidia</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-13-13"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Now when Paul and his party set sail from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia; and John, departing from them, returned to Jerusalem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and sat down. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And after the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, &#8220;Men <i>and</i> brethren, if you have any word of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>exhortation for the people, say on.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then Paul stood up, and motioning with <i>his</i> hand said, &#8220;Men of Israel, and you who fear God, listen: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>The God of this people <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>an uplifted arm He brought them out of it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Now for a time of about forty years He put up with their ways in the wilderness. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And when He had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, He distributed their land to them by allotment.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>&#8220;After that He gave <i>them</i> judges for about four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And afterward they asked for a king; so God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And when He had removed him, He raised up for them David as king, to whom also He gave testimony and said, <span class="oblique">&#8216;I have found David</span> the <i>son</i> of Jesse, <span class="oblique">a man after My</span> <i>own</i> <span class="oblique">heart,</span> who will do all My will.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>From this man&#8217;s seed, according to <i>the</i> promise, God raised up for Israel a<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span> Savior&#8212;Jesus&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>after John had first preached, before His coming, the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And as John was finishing his course, he said, &#8216;Who do you think I am? I am not <i>He.</i> But behold, there comes One after me, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to loose.&#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>&#8220;Men <i>and</i> brethren, sons of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>family of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, to you the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>word of this salvation has been sent. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>For those who dwell in Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they did not know Him, nor even the voices of the Prophets which are read every Sabbath, have fulfilled <i>them</i> in condemning <i>Him.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And though they found no cause for death <i>in Him,</i> they asked Pilate that He should be put to death. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Now when they had fulfilled all that was written concerning Him, they took <i>Him</i> down from the tree and laid <i>Him</i> in a tomb. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>But God raised Him from the dead. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>He was seen for many days by those who came up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are His witnesses to the people. </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>God has fulfilled this for us their children, in that He has raised up Jesus.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>Now when the congregation had broken up, many of the Jews and devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>On the next Sabbath almost the whole city came together to hear the word of God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy; and contradicting and blaspheming, they opposed the things spoken by Paul. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span>Then Paul and Barnabas grew bold and said, &#8220;It was necessary that the word of God should be spoken to you first; but since you reject it, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, behold, we turn to the Gentiles. </span>
