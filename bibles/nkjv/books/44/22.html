<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And when they heard that he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, they kept all the more silent.</span></p><p><span class="text Acts-22-2">Then he said: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8220;I am indeed a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, taught according to the strictness of our fathers&#8217; law, and was zealous toward God as you all are today. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>as also the high priest bears me witness, and all the council of the elders, from whom I also received letters to the brethren, and went to Damascus to bring in chains even those who were there to Jerusalem to be punished.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>&#8220;Now it happened, as I journeyed and came near Damascus at about noon, suddenly a great light from heaven shone around me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, <span class="woj">&#8216;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So I answered, &#8216;Who are You, Lord?&#8217; And He said to me, <span class="woj">&#8216;I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting.&#8217;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;And those who were with me indeed saw the light <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>and were afraid, but they did not hear the voice of Him who spoke to me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So I said, &#8216;What shall I do, Lord?&#8217; And the Lord said to me, <span class="woj">&#8216;Arise and go into Damascus, and there you will be told all things which are appointed for you to do.&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And since I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of those who were with me, I came into Damascus.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>&#8220;Then a certain Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good testimony with all the Jews who dwelt <i>there,</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>came to me; and he stood and said to me, &#8216;Brother Saul, receive your sight.&#8217; And at that same hour I looked up at him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then he said, &#8216;The God of our fathers has chosen you that you should know His will, and see the Just One, and hear the voice of His mouth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>For you will be His witness to all men of what you have seen and heard. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And now why are you waiting? Arise and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on the name of the Lord.&#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>&#8220;Now it happened, when I returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, that I was in a trance </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>and saw Him saying to me, <span class="woj">&#8216;Make haste and get out of Jerusalem quickly, for they will not receive your testimony concerning Me.&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>So I said, &#8216;Lord, they know that in every synagogue I imprisoned and beat those who believe on You. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And when the blood of Your martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by consenting <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>to his death, and guarding the clothes of those who were killing him.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then He said to me, <span class="woj">&#8216;Depart,</span> <span class="woj">for I will send you far from here to the Gentiles.&#8217;</span> &#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Paul&#8217;s Roman Citizenship</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-22-22"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And they listened to him until this word, and <i>then</i> they raised their voices and said, &#8220;Away with such a <i>fellow</i> from the earth, for he is not fit to live!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Then, as they cried out and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>tore off <i>their</i> clothes and threw dust into the air, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>the commander ordered him to be brought into the barracks, and said that he should be examined under scourging, so that he might know why they shouted so against him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said to the centurion who stood by, &#8220;Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman, and uncondemned?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>When the centurion heard <i>that,</i> he went and told the commander, saying, &#8220;Take care what you do, for this man is a Roman.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Then the commander came and said to him, &#8220;Tell me, are you a Roman?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Acts-22-27">He said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>The commander answered, &#8220;With a large sum I obtained this citizenship.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Acts-22-28">And Paul said, &#8220;But I was born <i>a citizen.</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Then immediately those who were about to examine him withdrew from him; and the commander was also afraid after he found out that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.</span></p> <h3>
The Sanhedrin Divided</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-22-30"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>The next day, because he wanted to know for certain why he was accused by the Jews, he released him from <i>his</i> bonds, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down and set him before them.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-27714a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 22:9">Acts 22:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>and were afraid</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27725b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 22:20">Acts 22:20</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>to his death</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27728c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 22:23">Acts 22:23</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>threw</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
