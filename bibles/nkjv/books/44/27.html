<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So, entering a ship of Adramyttium, we put to sea, meaning to sail along the coasts of Asia. Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, was with us. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And the next <i>day</i> we landed at Sidon. And Julius treated Paul kindly and gave <i>him</i> liberty to go to his friends and receive care. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>When we had put to sea from there, we sailed under <i>the shelter of</i> Cyprus, because the winds were contrary. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And when we had sailed over the sea which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, <i>a city</i> of Lycia. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing to Italy, and he put us on board.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>When we had sailed slowly many days, and arrived with difficulty off Cnidus, the wind not permitting us to proceed, we sailed under <i>the shelter of</i> Crete off Salmone. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Passing it with difficulty, we came to a place called Fair Havens, near the city <i>of</i> Lasea.</span></p> <h3>
Paul&#8217;s Warning Ignored</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-27-9"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Now when much time had been spent, and sailing was now dangerous because <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>the Fast was already over, Paul advised them, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>saying, &#8220;Men, I perceive that this voyage will end with disaster and much loss, not only of the cargo and ship, but also our lives.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Nevertheless the centurion was more persuaded by the helmsman and the owner of the ship than by the things spoken by Paul. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And because the harbor was not suitable to winter in, the majority advised to set sail from there also, if by any means they could reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete opening toward the southwest and northwest, <i>and</i> winter <i>there.</i></span></p> <h3>
In the Tempest</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-27-13"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>When the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained <i>their</i> desire, putting out to sea, they sailed close by Crete. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But not long after, a tempestuous head wind arose, called <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>Euroclydon. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So when the ship was caught, and could not head into the wind, we let <i>her</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>drive. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And running under <i>the shelter of</i> an island called <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>Clauda, we secured the skiff with difficulty. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>When they had taken it on board, they used cables to undergird the ship; and fearing lest they should run aground on the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>Syrtis <i>Sands,</i> they struck sail and so were driven. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And because we were exceedingly tempest-tossed, the next <i>day</i> they lightened the ship. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>On the third <i>day</i> we threw the ship&#8217;s tackle overboard with our own hands. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Now when neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small tempest beat on <i>us,</i> all hope that we would be saved was finally given up.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>But after long abstinence from food, then Paul stood in the midst of them and said, &#8220;Men, you should have listened to me, and not have sailed from Crete and incurred this disaster and loss. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And now I urge you to take <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>heart, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>For there stood by me this night an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I serve, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>saying, &#8216;Do not be afraid, Paul; you must be brought before Caesar; and indeed God has granted you all those who sail with you.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Therefore take heart, men, for I believe God that it will be just as it was told me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>However, we must run aground on a certain island.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Now when the fourteenth night had come, as we were driven up and down in the Adriatic <i>Sea,</i> about midnight the sailors sensed that they were drawing near some land. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And they took soundings and found <i>it</i> to be twenty fathoms; and when they had gone a little farther, they took soundings again and found <i>it</i> to be fifteen fathoms. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Then, fearing lest we should run aground on the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern, and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>prayed for day to come. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And as the sailors were seeking to escape from the ship, when they had let down the skiff into the sea, under pretense of putting out anchors from the prow, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, &#8220;Unless these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the skiff and let it fall off.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And as day was about to dawn, Paul implored <i>them</i> all to take food, saying, &#8220;Today is the fourteenth day you have waited and continued without food, and eaten nothing. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Therefore I urge you to take nourishment, for this is for your survival, since not a hair will fall from the head of any of you.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>And when he had said these things, he took bread and gave thanks to God in the presence of them all; and when he had broken <i>it</i> he began to eat. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Then they were all encouraged, and also took food themselves. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>And in all we were two hundred and seventy-six persons on the ship. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>So when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship and threw out the wheat into the sea.</span></p> <h3>
Shipwrecked on Malta</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-27-39"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>When it was day, they did not recognize the land; but they observed a bay with a beach, onto which they planned to run the ship if possible. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>And they <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>let go the anchors and left <i>them</i> in the sea, meanwhile loosing the rudder ropes; and they hoisted the mainsail to the wind and made for shore. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>But striking <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the prow stuck fast and remained immovable, but the stern was being broken up by the violence of the waves.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>And the soldiers&#8217; plan was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim away and escape. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>But the centurion, wanting to save Paul, kept them from <i>their</i> purpose, and commanded that those who could swim should jump <i>overboard</i> first and get to land, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>and the rest, some on boards and some on <i>parts</i> of the ship. And so it was that they all escaped safely to land.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-27865a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 27:9">Acts 27:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'>The Day of Atonement, late September or early October</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27870b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 27:14">Acts 27:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'>A southeast wind that stirs up broad waves; NU <i>Euraquilon,</i> a northeaster</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27871c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 27:15">Acts 27:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>be driven</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27872d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 27:16">Acts 27:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>Cauda</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27873e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 27:17">Acts 27:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'>M <i>Syrtes</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27878f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 27:22">Acts 27:22</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>courage</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27885g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 27:29">Acts 27:29</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>wished</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27896h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 27:40">Acts 27:40</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>cast off</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27897i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 27:41">Acts 27:41</span> <span class='footnote-text'>A reef</span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
