<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then Paul, as his custom was, went in to them, and for three Sabbaths reasoned with them from the Scriptures, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>explaining and demonstrating that the Christ had to suffer and rise again from the dead, and <i>saying,</i> &#8220;This Jesus whom I preach to you is the Christ.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And some of them were persuaded; and a great multitude of the devout Greeks, and not a few of the leading women, joined Paul and Silas.</span></p> <h3>
Assault on Jason&#8217;s House</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-17-5"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But the Jews <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>who were not persuaded, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>becoming envious, took some of the evil men from the marketplace, and gathering a mob, set all the city in an uproar and attacked the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some brethren to the rulers of the city, crying out, &#8220;These who have turned the world upside down have come here too. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Jason has <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>harbored them, and these are all acting contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying there is another king&#8212;Jesus.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And they troubled the crowd and the rulers of the city when they heard these things. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So when they had taken security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.</span></p> <h3>
Ministering at Berea</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-17-10"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then the brethren immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea. When they arrived, they went into the synagogue of the Jews. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>These were more <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>fair-minded than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness, and searched the Scriptures daily <i>to find out</i> whether these things were so. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Therefore many of them believed, and also not a few of the Greeks, prominent women as well as men. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>But when the Jews from Thessalonica learned that the word of God was preached by Paul at Berea, they came there also and stirred up the crowds. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then immediately the brethren sent Paul away, to go to the sea; but both Silas and Timothy remained there. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So those who conducted Paul brought him to Athens; and receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him with all speed, they departed.</span></p> <h3>
The Philosophers at Athens</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-17-16"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him when he saw that the city was <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>given over to idols. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Therefore he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and with the <i>Gentile</i> worshipers, and in the marketplace daily with those who happened to be there. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>Then certain Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him. And some said, &#8220;What does this <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>babbler want to say?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Acts-17-18">Others said, &#8220;He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign gods,&#8221; because he preached to them Jesus and the resurrection.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And they took him and brought him to the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>Areopagus, saying, &#8220;May we know what this new doctrine <i>is</i> of which you speak? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>For you are bringing some strange things to our ears. Therefore we want to know what these things mean.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>For all the Athenians and the foreigners who were there spent their time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing.</span></p> <h3>
Addressing the Areopagus</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-17-22"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then Paul stood in the midst of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>Areopagus and said, &#8220;Men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are very religious; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>for as I was passing through and considering the objects of your worship, I even found an altar with this inscription:</span></p><p class="center_top-1"><span class="text Acts-17-23">TO THE UNKNOWN GOD.</span></p><p class="first-line-none top-1"><span class="text Acts-17-23">Therefore, the One whom you worship without knowing, Him I proclaim to you: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>God, who made the world and everything in it, since He is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Nor is He worshiped with men&#8217;s hands, as though He needed anything, since He gives to all life, breath, and all things. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And He has made from one <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>blood every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, and has determined their preappointed times and the boundaries of their dwellings, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>so that they should seek the Lord, in the hope that they might grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>for in Him we live and move and have our being, as also some of your own poets have said, &#8216;For we are also His offspring.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Therefore, since we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold or silver or stone, something shaped by art and man&#8217;s devising. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Truly, these times of ignorance God overlooked, but now commands all men everywhere to repent, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>because He has appointed a day on which He will judge the world in righteousness by the Man whom He has ordained. He has given assurance of this to all by raising Him from the dead.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked, while others said, &#8220;We will hear you again on this <i>matter.</i>&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>So Paul departed from among them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>However, some men joined him and believed, among them Dionysius the Areopagite, a woman named Damaris, and others with them.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-27529a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 17:5">Acts 17:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>who were not persuaded</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27529b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 17:5">Acts 17:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'>M omits <i>becoming envious</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27531c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 17:7">Acts 17:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>welcomed</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27535d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 17:11">Acts 17:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>noble</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27540e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 17:16">Acts 17:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>full of idols</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27542f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 17:18">Acts 17:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M add <i>also</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27542g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 17:18">Acts 17:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>seed picker,</i> an idler who makes a living picking up scraps</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27543h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 17:19">Acts 17:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Hill of Ares,</i> or <i>Mars&#8217; Hill</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27546i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 17:22">Acts 17:22</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Hill of Ares,</i> or <i>Mars&#8217; Hill</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27550j"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 17:26">Acts 17:26</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>blood</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
