<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Therefore, when Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and dispute with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas and certain others of them should go up to Jerusalem, to the apostles and elders, about this question.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So, being sent on their way by the church, they passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, describing the conversion of the Gentiles; and they caused great joy to all the brethren. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And when they had come to Jerusalem, they were received by the church and the apostles and the elders; and they reported all things that God had done with them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But some of the sect of the Pharisees who believed rose up, saying, &#8220;It is necessary to circumcise them, and to command <i>them</i> to keep the law of Moses.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
The Jerusalem Council</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-15-6"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now the apostles and elders came together to consider this matter. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And when there had been much dispute, Peter rose up <i>and</i> said to them: &#8220;Men <i>and</i> brethren, you know that a good while ago God chose among us, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So God, who knows the heart, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>acknowledged them by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as <i>He did</i> to us, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and made no distinction between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Now therefore, why do you test God by putting a yoke on the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>Christ we shall be saved in the same manner as they.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then all the multitude kept silent and listened to Barnabas and Paul declaring how many miracles and wonders God had worked through them among the Gentiles. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And after they had <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>become silent, James answered, saying, &#8220;Men <i>and</i> brethren, listen to me: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Simon has declared how God at the first visited the Gentiles to take out of them a people for His name. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And with this the words of the prophets agree, just as it is written:</span></p> <div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span><span class="oblique">&#8216;After</span> <span class="oblique">this I will return</span></span><br /><span class="text Acts-15-16"><span class="oblique">And will rebuild the tabernacle of David, which has fallen down;</span></span><br /><span class="text Acts-15-16"><span class="oblique">I will rebuild its ruins,</span></span><br /><span class="text Acts-15-16"><span class="oblique">And I will set it up;</span></span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span><span class="oblique">So that the rest of mankind may seek the</span> <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span><span class="oblique">,</span></span><br /><span class="text Acts-15-17"><span class="oblique">Even all the Gentiles who are called by My name,</span></span><br /><span class="text Acts-15-17"><span class="oblique">Says the</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span><span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <span class="oblique">who does all these things.&#8217;</span></span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>&#8220;Known to God from eternity are all His works. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Therefore I judge that we should not trouble those from among the Gentiles who are turning to God, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>but that we write to them to abstain from things polluted by idols, <i>from</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>sexual immorality, <i>from</i> things strangled, and <i>from</i> blood. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>For Moses has had throughout many generations those who preach him in every city, being read in the synagogues every Sabbath.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
The Jerusalem Decree</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-15-22"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then it pleased the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas, <i>namely,</i> Judas who was also named Barsabas,<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span> and Silas, leading men among the brethren.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>They wrote this <i>letter</i> by them:</span></p><div class="left-1 top-1"><p class="first-line-none"><span class="text Acts-15-23">The apostles, the elders, and the brethren,</span></p></div> <div class="left-1 top-1"><p class="first-line-none"><span class="text Acts-15-23">To the brethren who are of the Gentiles in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia:</span></p></div> <div class="left-1 top-1"><p class="first-line-none"><span class="text Acts-15-23">Greetings.</span></p></div> <div class="left-1 top-1"><p class="first-line-none">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Since we have heard that some who went out from us have troubled you with words, unsettling your souls, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>saying, &#8220;<i>You must</i> be circumcised and keep the law&#8221;&#8212;to whom we gave no <i>such</i> commandment&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>it seemed good to us, being assembled with one <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>accord, to send chosen men to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, who will also report the same things by word of mouth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>that you abstain from things offered to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from sexual<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span> immorality.

Continuing Ministry in Syria</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-15-30"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>So when they were sent off, they came to Antioch; and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the letter. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>When they had read it, they rejoiced over its encouragement. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Now Judas and Silas, themselves being prophets also, exhorted and strengthened the brethren with many words. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And after they had stayed <i>there</i> for a time, they were sent back with greetings from the brethren to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span>the apostles.</span></p> <p>
34<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[l]</a></span>However, it seemed good to Silas to remain there. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Paul and Barnabas also remained in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.</span></p> <h3>
Division over John Mark</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-15-36"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Then after some days Paul said to Barnabas, &#8220;Let us now go back and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, <i>and see</i> how they are doing.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>Now Barnabas <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[m]</a></span>was determined to take with them John called Mark. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>But Paul insisted that they should not take with them the one who had departed from them in Pamphylia, and had not gone with them to the work. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>Then the contention became so sharp that they parted from one another. And so Barnabas took Mark and sailed to Cyprus; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>but Paul chose Silas and departed, being <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[n]</a></span>commended by the brethren to the grace of God. </span>
