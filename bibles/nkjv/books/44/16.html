And behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, <i>the</i> son of a certain Jewish woman who believed, but his father <i>was</i> Greek. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>He was well spoken of by the brethren who were at Lystra and Iconium. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Paul wanted to have him go on with him. And he took <i>him</i> and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in that region, for they all knew that his father was Greek. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And as they went through the cities, they delivered to them the decrees to keep, which were determined by the apostles and elders at Jerusalem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So the churches were strengthened in the faith, and increased in number daily.</span></p> <h3>
The Macedonian Call</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-16-6"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now when they had gone through Phrygia and the region of Galatia, they were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach the word in <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>Asia. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>After they had come to Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, but the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>Spirit did not permit them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And a vision appeared to Paul in the night. A man of Macedonia stood and pleaded with him, saying, &#8220;Come over to Macedonia and help us.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Now after he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go to Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to preach the gospel to them.</span></p> <h3>
Lydia Baptized at Philippi</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-16-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Therefore, sailing from Troas, we ran a straight course to Samothrace, and the next <i>day</i> came to Neapolis, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>and from there to Philippi, which is the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>foremost city of that part of Macedonia, a colony. And we were staying in that city for some days. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And on the Sabbath day we went out of the city to the riverside, where prayer was customarily made; and we sat down and spoke to the women who met <i>there.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Now a certain woman named Lydia heard <i>us.</i> She was a seller of purple from the city of Thyatira, who worshiped God. The Lord opened her heart to heed the things spoken by Paul. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And when she and her household were baptized, she begged <i>us,</i> saying, &#8220;If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come to my house and stay.&#8221; So she persuaded us.</span></p> <h3>
Paul and Silas Imprisoned</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-16-16"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Now it happened, as we went to prayer, that a certain slave girl possessed with a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much profit by fortune-telling. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>This girl followed Paul and us, and cried out, saying, &#8220;These men are the servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to us the way of salvation.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And this she did for many days.</span></p><p><span class="text Acts-16-18">But Paul, greatly <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, &#8220;I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.&#8221; And he came out that very hour. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>But when her masters saw that their hope of profit was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged <i>them</i> into the marketplace to the authorities.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And they brought them to the magistrates, and said, &#8220;These men, being Jews, exceedingly trouble our city; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>and they teach customs which are not lawful for us, being Romans, to receive or observe.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then the multitude rose up together against them; and the magistrates tore off their clothes and commanded <i>them</i> to be beaten with rods. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And when they had laid many stripes on them, they threw <i>them</i> into prison, commanding the jailer to keep them securely. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Having received such a charge, he put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.</span></p> <h3>
The Philippian Jailer Saved</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-16-25"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>But at midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone&#8217;s chains were loosed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And the keeper of the prison, awaking from sleep and seeing the prison doors open, supposing the prisoners had fled, drew his sword and was about to kill himself. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>But Paul called with a loud voice, saying, &#8220;Do yourself no harm, for we are all here.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Then he called for a light, ran in, and fell down trembling before Paul and Silas. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And he brought them out and said, &#8220;Sirs, what must I do to be saved?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>So they said, &#8220;Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And he took them the same hour of the night and washed <i>their</i> stripes. And immediately he and all his <i>family</i> were baptized. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Now when he had brought them into his house, he set food before them; and he rejoiced, having believed in God with all his household.</span></p> <h3>
Paul Refuses to Depart Secretly</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-16-35"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>And when it was day, the magistrates sent the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>officers, saying, &#8220;Let those men go.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>So the keeper of the prison reported these words to Paul, saying, &#8220;The magistrates have sent to let you go. Now therefore depart, and go in peace.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>But Paul said to them, &#8220;They have beaten us openly, uncondemned Romans, <i>and</i> have thrown <i>us</i> into prison. And now do they put us out secretly? No indeed! Let them come themselves and get us out.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>And the officers told these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>Then they came and pleaded with them and brought <i>them</i> out, and asked <i>them</i> to depart from the city. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>So they went out of the prison and entered <i>the house of</i> Lydia; and when they had seen the brethren, they encouraged them and departed.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-27490a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 16:6">Acts 16:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'>The Roman province of Asia</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27491b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 16:7">Acts 16:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU adds <i>of Jesus</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27496c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 16:12">Acts 16:12</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>first</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27502d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 16:18">Acts 16:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>distressed</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27519e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 16:35">Acts 16:35</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>lictors,</i> lit. <i>rod bearers</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
