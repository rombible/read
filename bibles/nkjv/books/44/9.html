<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and asked letters from him to the synagogues of Damascus, so that if he found any who were of the Way, whether men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>As he journeyed he came near Damascus, and suddenly a light shone around him from heaven. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then he fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;Saul, Saul,</span> <span class="woj">why are you persecuting Me?&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;Who are You, Lord?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Acts-9-5">Then the Lord said, <span class="woj">&#8220;I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span><span class="woj">It <i>is</i> hard for you to kick against the goads.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So he, trembling and astonished, said, &#8220;Lord, what do You want me to do?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Acts-9-6">Then the Lord <i>said</i> to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;Arise and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And the men who journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice but seeing no one. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then Saul arose from the ground, and when his eyes were opened he saw no one. But they led him by the hand and brought <i>him</i> into Damascus. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And he was three days without sight, and neither ate nor drank.</span></p> <h3>
Ananias Baptizes Saul</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-9-10"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus named Ananias; and to him the Lord said in a vision, <span class="woj">&#8220;Ananias.&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span class="text Acts-9-10">And he said, &#8220;Here I am, Lord.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So the Lord <i>said</i> to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;Arise and go to the street called Straight, and inquire at the house of Judas for <i>one</i> called Saul</span> <span class="woj">of Tarsus, for behold, he is praying.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span><span class="woj">And in a vision he has seen a man named Ananias coming in and putting <i>his</i> hand on him, so that he might receive his sight.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then Ananias answered, &#8220;Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>harm he has done to Your saints in Jerusalem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on Your name.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But the Lord said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;Go, for</span> <span class="woj">he is a chosen vessel of Mine to bear My name before</span> <span class="woj">Gentiles,</span> <span class="woj">kings, and the</span> <span class="woj">children</span><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> <span class="woj">of Israel.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span><span class="woj">For</span> <span class="woj">I will show him how many things he must suffer for My</span> <span class="woj">name&#8217;s sake.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And Ananias went his way and entered the house; and laying his hands on him he said, &#8220;Brother Saul, the Lord <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you came, has sent me that you may receive your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Immediately there fell from his eyes <i>something</i> like scales, and he received his sight at once; and he arose and was baptized.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>So when he had received food, he was strengthened. Then Saul spent some days with the disciples at Damascus.</span></p> <h3>
Saul Preaches Christ</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-9-20"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Immediately he preached <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>the Christ in the synagogues, that He is the Son of God.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then all who heard were amazed, and said, &#8220;Is this not he who destroyed those who called on this name in Jerusalem, and has come here for that purpose, so that he might bring them bound to the chief priests?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But Saul increased all the more in strength, and confounded the Jews who dwelt in Damascus, proving that this <i>Jesus</i> is the Christ.</span></p> <h3>
Saul Escapes Death</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-9-23"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Now after many days were past, the Jews plotted to kill him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>But their plot became known to Saul. And they watched the gates day and night, to kill him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then the disciples took him by night and let <i>him</i> down through the wall in a large basket.</span></p> <h3>
Saul at Jerusalem</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-9-26"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And when Saul had come to Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, and did not believe that he was a disciple. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>But Barnabas took him and brought <i>him</i> to the apostles. And he declared to them how he had seen the Lord on the road, and that He had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>So he was with them at Jerusalem, coming in and going out. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And he spoke boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus and disputed against the Hellenists,<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span> but they attempted to kill him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>When the brethren found out, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him out to Tarsus.</span></p> <h3>
The Church Prospers</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-9-31"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Then the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>churches throughout all Judea, Galilee, and Samaria had peace and were edified.<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span> And walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, they were multiplied.</span></p> <h3>
Aeneas Healed</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-9-32"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Now it came to pass, as Peter went through all <i>parts of the country,</i> that he also came down to the saints who dwelt in Lydda. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>There he found a certain man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden eight years and was paralyzed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>And Peter said to him, &#8220;Aeneas, Jesus the Christ heals you. Arise and make your bed.&#8221; Then he arose immediately. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>So all who dwelt at Lydda and Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord.</span></p> <h3>
Dorcas Restored to Life</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-9-36"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>At Joppa there was a certain disciple named <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>Tabitha, which is translated <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>Dorcas. This woman was full of good works and charitable deeds which she did. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>But it happened in those days that she became sick and died. When they had washed her, they laid <i>her</i> in an upper room. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>And since Lydda was near Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent two men to him, imploring <i>him</i> not to delay in coming to them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>Then Peter arose and went with them. When he had come, they brought <i>him</i> to the upper room. And all the widows stood by him weeping, showing the tunics and garments which Dorcas had made while she was with them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>But Peter put them all out, and knelt down and prayed. And turning to the body he said, &#8220;Tabitha, arise.&#8221; And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter she sat up. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>Then he gave her <i>his</i> hand and lifted her up; and when he had called the saints and widows, he presented her alive. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>And it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed on the Lord. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>So it was that he stayed many days in Joppa with Simon, a tanner.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-27222a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 9:5">Acts 9:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M omit the rest of v. <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Acts.9.5" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=Acts.9.5&amp;version=NKJV">5</span> and begin v. <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Acts.9.6" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=Acts.9.6&amp;version=NKJV">6</span> with <i>But arise and go</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27230b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 9:13">Acts 9:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>bad things</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27232c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 9:15">Acts 9:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>sons</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27234d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 9:17">Acts 9:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'>M omits <i>Jesus</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27237e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 9:20">Acts 9:20</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>Jesus</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27246f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 9:29">Acts 9:29</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Greek-speaking Jews</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27248g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 9:31">Acts 9:31</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>church</i> . . . <i>was</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27248h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 9:31">Acts 9:31</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>built up</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27253i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 9:36">Acts 9:36</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit., in Aram., <i>Gazelle</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27253j"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 9:36">Acts 9:36</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit., in Gr., <i>Gazelle</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
