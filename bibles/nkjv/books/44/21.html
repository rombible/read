<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/21-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And finding a ship sailing over to Phoenicia, we went aboard and set sail. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/21-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>When we had sighted Cyprus, we passed it on the left, sailed to Syria, and landed at Tyre; for there the ship was to unload her cargo. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/21-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And finding <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>disciples, we stayed there seven days. They told Paul through the Spirit not to go up to Jerusalem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/21-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>When we had come to the end of those days, we departed and went on our way; and they all accompanied us, with wives and children, till <i>we were</i> out of the city. And we knelt down on the shore and prayed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/21-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>When we had taken our leave of one another, we boarded the ship, and they returned home.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/21-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And when we had finished <i>our</i> voyage from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais, greeted the brethren, and stayed with them one day. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/21-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>On the next <i>day</i> we <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>who were Paul&#8217;s companions departed and came to Caesarea, and entered the house of Philip the evangelist, who was <i>one</i> of the seven, and stayed with him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/21-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Now this man had four virgin daughters who prophesied. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/21-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And as we stayed many days, a certain prophet named Agabus came down from Judea. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/21-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>When he had come to us, he took Paul&#8217;s belt, bound his <i>own</i> hands and feet, and said, &#8220;Thus says the Holy Spirit, &#8216;So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man who owns this belt, and deliver <i>him</i> into the hands of the Gentiles.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/21-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now when we heard these things, both we and those from that place pleaded with him not to go up to Jerusalem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/21-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then Paul answered, &#8220;What do you mean by weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/21-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, &#8220;The will of the Lord be done.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Paul Urged to Make Peace</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-21-15"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/21-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And after those days we <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>packed and went up to Jerusalem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/21-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Also some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us and brought with them a certain Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we were to lodge.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/21-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And when we had come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/21-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>On the following <i>day</i> Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/21-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>When he had greeted them, he told in detail those things which God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/21-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And when they heard <i>it,</i> they glorified the Lord. And they said to him, &#8220;You see, brother, how many myriads of Jews there are who have believed, and they are all zealous for the law; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/21-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>but they have been informed about you that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise <i>their</i> children nor to walk according to the customs. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/21-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>What then? The assembly must certainly meet, for they will hear that you have come. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/21-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Therefore do what we tell you: We have four men who have taken a vow. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/21-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Take them and be purified with them, and pay their expenses so that they may shave <i>their</i> heads, and that all may know that those things of which they were informed concerning you are nothing, but <i>that</i> you yourself also walk orderly and keep the law. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/21-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>But concerning the Gentiles who believe, we have written <i>and</i> decided <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>that they should observe no such thing, except that they should keep themselves from <i>things</i> offered to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>sexual immorality.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Arrested in the Temple</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-21-26"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/21-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Then Paul took the men, and the next day, having been purified with them, entered the temple to announce the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>expiration of the days of purification, at which time an offering should be made for each one of them.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/21-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Now when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews from Asia, seeing him in the temple, stirred up the whole crowd and laid hands on him, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/21-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>crying out, &#8220;Men of Israel, help! This is the man who teaches all <i>men</i> everywhere against the people, the law, and this place; and furthermore he also brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/21-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>(For they had <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/21-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And all the city was disturbed; and the people ran together, seized Paul, and dragged him out of the temple; and immediately the doors were shut. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/21-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Now as they were seeking to kill him, news came to the commander of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>garrison that all Jerusalem was in an uproar. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/21-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>He immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them. And when they saw the commander and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/21-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Then the commander came near and took him, and commanded <i>him</i> to be bound with two chains; and he asked who he was and what he had done. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/21-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>And some among the multitude cried one thing and some another.</span></p><p><span class="text Acts-21-34">So when he could not ascertain the truth because of the tumult, he commanded him to be taken into the barracks. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/21-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>When he reached the stairs, he had to be carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the mob. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/21-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>For the multitude of the people followed after, crying out, &#8220;Away with him!&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Addressing the Jerusalem Mob</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-21-37"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/21-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>Then as Paul was about to be led into the barracks, he said to the commander, &#8220;May I speak to you?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Acts-21-37">He replied, &#8220;Can you speak Greek? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/21-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>Are you not the Egyptian who some time ago stirred up a rebellion and led the four thousand assassins out into the wilderness?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/21-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>But Paul said, &#8220;I am a Jew from Tarsus, in Cilicia, a citizen of no <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>mean city; and I implore you, permit me to speak to the people.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/21-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>So when he had given him permission, Paul stood on the stairs and motioned with his hand to the people. And when there was a great silence, he spoke to <i>them</i> in the Hebrew language, saying,</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-27669a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 21:4">Acts 21:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>the disciples</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27673b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 21:8">Acts 21:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>who were Paul&#8217;s companions</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27680c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 21:15">Acts 21:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>made preparations</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27687d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 21:22">Acts 21:22</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>What then is to be done?
