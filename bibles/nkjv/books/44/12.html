<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then he killed James the brother of John with the sword. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And because he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to seize Peter also. Now it was <i>during</i> the Days of Unleavened Bread. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So when he had arrested him, he put <i>him</i> in prison, and delivered <i>him</i> to four <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>squads of soldiers to keep him, intending to bring him before the people after Passover.</span></p> <h3>
Peter Freed from Prison</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-12-5"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Peter was therefore kept in prison, but <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>constant prayer was offered to God for him by the church. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And when Herod was about to bring him out, that night Peter was sleeping, bound with two chains between two soldiers; and the guards before the door were <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>keeping the prison. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now behold, an angel of the Lord stood by <i>him,</i> and a light shone in the prison; and he struck Peter on the side and raised him up, saying, &#8220;Arise quickly!&#8221; And his chains fell off <i>his</i> hands. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then the angel said to him, &#8220;Gird yourself and tie on your sandals&#8221;; and so he did. And he said to him, &#8220;Put on your garment and follow me.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So he went out and followed him, and did not know that what was done by the angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>When they were past the first and the second guard posts, they came to the iron gate that leads to the city, which opened to them of its own accord; and they went out and went down one street, and immediately the angel departed from him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And when Peter had come to himself, he said, &#8220;Now I know for certain that the Lord has sent His angel, and has delivered me from the hand of Herod and <i>from</i> all the expectation of the Jewish people.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So, when he had considered <i>this,</i> he came to the house of Mary, the mother of John whose surname was Mark, where many were gathered together praying. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a girl named Rhoda came to answer. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>When she recognized Peter&#8217;s voice, because of <i>her</i> gladness she did not open the gate, but ran in and announced that Peter stood before the gate. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But they said to her, &#8220;You are beside yourself!&#8221; Yet she kept insisting that it was so. So they said, &#8220;It is his angel.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Now Peter continued knocking; and when they opened <i>the door</i> and saw him, they were astonished. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But motioning to them with his hand to keep silent, he declared to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, &#8220;Go, tell these things to James and to the brethren.&#8221; And he departed and went to another place.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then, as soon as it was day, there was no small <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>stir among the soldiers about what had become of Peter. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>But when Herod had searched for him and not found him, he examined the guards and commanded that <i>they</i> should be put to death.</span></p><p><span class="text Acts-12-19">And he went down from Judea to Caesarea, and stayed <i>there.</i></span></p> <h3>
Herod&#8217;s Violent Death</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-12-20"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Now Herod had been very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon; but they came to him with one accord, and having made Blastus <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>the king&#8217;s personal aide their friend, they asked for peace, because their country was <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>supplied with food by the king&#8217;s <i>country.</i></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>So on a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat on his throne and gave an oration to them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And the people kept shouting, &#8220;The voice of a god and not of a man!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Then immediately an angel of the Lord struck him, because he did not give glory to God. And he was eaten by worms and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>died.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>But the word of God grew and multiplied.</span></p> <h3>
Barnabas and Saul Appointed</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-12-25"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And Barnabas and Saul returned <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>from Jerusalem when they had fulfilled <i>their</i> ministry, and they also took with them John whose surname was Mark.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-27342a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 12:4">Acts 12:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Gr. <i>tetrads,</i> squads of four</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27343b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 12:5">Acts 12:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>constantly</i> or <i>earnestly</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27344c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 12:6">Acts 12:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>guarding</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27356d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 12:18">Acts 12:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>disturbance</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27358e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 12:20">Acts 12:20</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>who was in charge of the king&#8217;s bedchamber</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27358f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 12:20">Acts 12:20</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>nourished</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27361g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 12:23">Acts 12:23</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>breathed his last</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27363h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 12:25">Acts 12:25</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M <i>to</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
