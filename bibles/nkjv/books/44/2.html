<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then there appeared to them <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>divided tongues, as of fire, and <i>one</i> sat upon each of them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</span></p> <h3>
The Crowd&#8217;s Response</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-2-5"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under heaven. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And when this sound occurred, the multitude came together, and were confused, because everyone heard them speak in his own language. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then they were all amazed and marveled, saying to one another, &#8220;Look, are not all these who speak Galileans? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And how <i>is it that</i> we hear, each in our own <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>language in which we were born? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Parthians and Medes and Elamites, those dwelling in Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya adjoining Cyrene, visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes, </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So they were all amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, &#8220;Whatever could this mean?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Others mocking said, &#8220;They are full of new wine.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
