<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/18-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla (because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome); and he came to them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/18-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So, because he was of the same trade, he stayed with them and worked; for by occupation they were tentmakers. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/18-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And he reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath, and persuaded both Jews and Greeks.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/18-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>When Silas and Timothy had come from Macedonia, Paul was compelled <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>by the Spirit, and testified to the Jews <i>that</i> Jesus <i>is</i> the Christ. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/18-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But when they opposed him and blasphemed, he shook <i>his</i> garments and said to them, &#8220;Your blood <i>be</i> upon your <i>own</i> heads; I <i>am</i> clean. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/18-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And he departed from there and entered the house of a certain <i>man</i> named <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>Justus, <i>one</i> who worshiped God, whose house was next door to the synagogue. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/18-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his household. And many of the Corinthians, hearing, believed and were baptized.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/18-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Now the Lord spoke to Paul in the night by a vision, <span class="woj">&#8220;Do not be afraid, but speak, and do not keep silent;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/18-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><span class="woj">for I am with you, and no one will attack you to hurt you; for I have many people in this city.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/18-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And he continued <i>there</i> a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/18-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>When Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him to the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>judgment seat, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/18-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>saying, &#8220;This <i>fellow</i> persuades men to worship God contrary to the law.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/18-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And when Paul was about to open <i>his</i> mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, &#8220;If it were a matter of wrongdoing or wicked crimes, O Jews, there would be reason why I should bear with you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/18-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But if it is a question of words and names and your own law, look <i>to it</i> yourselves; for I do not want to be a judge of such <i>matters.</i>&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/18-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And he drove them from the judgment seat. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/18-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat <i>him</i> before the judgment seat. But Gallio took no notice of these things.</span></p> <h3>
Paul Returns to Antioch</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-18-18"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/18-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>So Paul still remained <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>a good while. Then he took leave of the brethren and sailed for Syria, and Priscilla and Aquila <i>were</i> with him. He had <i>his</i> hair cut off at Cenchrea, for he had taken a vow. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/18-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And he came to Ephesus, and left them there; but he himself entered the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/18-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>When they asked <i>him</i> to stay a longer time with them, he did not consent, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/18-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>but took leave of them, saying, &#8220;I<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span> must by all means keep this coming feast in Jerusalem; but I will return again to you, God willing.&#8221; And he sailed from Ephesus.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/18-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And when he had landed at Caesarea, and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>gone up and greeted the church, he went down to Antioch. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/18-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>After he had spent some time <i>there,</i> he departed and went over the region of Galatia and Phrygia <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>in order, strengthening all the disciples.</span></p> <h3>
Ministry of Apollos</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-18-24"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/18-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Now a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man <i>and</i> mighty in the Scriptures, came to Ephesus. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/18-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things of the Lord, though he knew only the baptism of John. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/18-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>So he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Aquila and Priscilla heard him, they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more accurately. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/18-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And when he desired to cross to Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him; and when he arrived, he greatly helped those who had believed through grace; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/18-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>for he vigorously refuted the Jews publicly, showing from the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-27563a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 18:5">Acts 18:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>in his spirit</i> or <i>in the Spirit</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27565b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 18:7">Acts 18:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>Titius Justus</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27570c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 18:12">Acts 18:12</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Gr. <i>bema</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27575d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 18:17">Acts 18:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>they all</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27576e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 18:18">Acts 18:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>many days</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27579f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 18:21">Acts 18:21</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>I must by all means keep this coming feast in Jerusalem</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27580g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 18:22">Acts 18:22</span> <span class='footnote-text'>To Jerusalem</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27581h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 18:23">Acts 18:23</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>successively</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
