<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/26-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;I think myself happy, King Agrippa, because today I shall answer for myself before you concerning all the things of which I am accused by the Jews, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/26-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>especially because you are expert in all customs and questions which have to do with the Jews. Therefore I beg you to hear me patiently.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/26-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8220;My manner of life from my youth, which was spent from the beginning among my own nation at Jerusalem, all the Jews know. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/26-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>They knew me from the first, if they were willing to testify, that according to the strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/26-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/26-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>To this <i>promise</i> our twelve tribes, earnestly serving <i>God</i> night and day, hope to attain. For this hope&#8217;s sake, King Agrippa, I am accused by the Jews. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/26-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Why should it be thought incredible by you that God raises the dead?</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/26-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;Indeed, I myself thought I must do many things <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/26-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>This I also did in Jerusalem, and many of the saints I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I cast my vote against <i>them.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/26-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And I punished them often in every synagogue and compelled <i>them</i> to blaspheme; and being exceedingly enraged against them, I persecuted <i>them</i> even to foreign cities.</span></p> <h3>
Paul Recounts His Conversion</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-26-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/26-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>&#8220;While thus occupied, as I journeyed to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/26-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>at midday, O king, along the road I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining around me and those who journeyed with me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/26-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And when we all had fallen to the ground, I heard a voice speaking to me and saying in the Hebrew language, <span class="woj">&#8216;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me? <i>It is</i> hard for you to kick against the goads.&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/26-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So I said, &#8216;Who are You, Lord?&#8217; And He said, <span class="woj">&#8216;I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/26-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span><span class="woj">But rise and stand on your feet; for I have appeared to you for this purpose,</span> <span class="woj">to make you a minister and a witness both of the things which you have seen and of the things which I will yet reveal to you.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/26-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span><span class="woj">I will</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span><span class="woj">deliver you from the <i>Jewish</i> people, as well as <i>from</i> the Gentiles,</span> <span class="woj">to whom I</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span><span class="woj">now send you,</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/26-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span><span class="woj">to open their eyes, <i>in order</i></span> <span class="woj">to turn <i>them</i> from darkness to light, and <i>from</i> the power of Satan to God,</span> <span class="woj">that they may receive forgiveness of sins and</span> <span class="woj">an inheritance among those who are</span> <span class="woj">sanctified</span><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span> <span class="woj">by faith in Me.&#8217;</span></span></p> <h3>
Paul&#8217;s Post-Conversion Life</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-26-19"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/26-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>&#8220;Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/26-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>but declared first to those in Damascus and in Jerusalem, and throughout all the region of Judea, and <i>then</i> to the Gentiles, that they should repent, turn to God, and do works befitting repentance. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/26-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>For these reasons the Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill <i>me.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/26-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Therefore, having obtained help from God, to this day I stand, witnessing both to small and great, saying no other things than those which the prophets and Moses said would come&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/26-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>that the Christ would suffer, that He would be the first to rise from the dead, and would proclaim light to the <i>Jewish</i> people and to the Gentiles.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Agrippa Parries Paul&#8217;s Challenge</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-26-24"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/26-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Now as he thus made his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, &#8220;Paul, you are beside yourself! Much learning is driving you mad!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/26-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>But he said, &#8220;I am not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>mad, most noble Festus, but speak the words of truth and reason. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/26-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>For the king, before whom I also speak freely, knows these things; for I am convinced that none of these things escapes his attention, since this thing was not done in a corner. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/26-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you do believe.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/26-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then Agrippa said to Paul, &#8220;You almost persuade me to become a Christian.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/26-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And Paul said, &#8220;I would to God that not only you, but also all who hear me today, might become both almost and altogether such as I am, except for these chains.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/26-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>When he had said these things, the king stood up, as well as the governor and Bernice and those who sat with them; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/26-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>and when they had gone aside, they talked among themselves, saying, &#8220;This man is doing nothing deserving of death or chains.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/26-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Then Agrippa said to Festus, &#8220;This man might have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.&#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-27833a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 26:9">Acts 26:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>against</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27841b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 26:17">Acts 26:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>rescue</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27841c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 26:17">Acts 26:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M omit <i>now</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27842d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 26:18">Acts 26:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>set apart</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27849e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 26:25">Acts 26:25</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>out of my mind</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
