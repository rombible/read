<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And when Peter came up to Jerusalem, those of the circumcision contended with him, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>saying, &#8220;You went in to uncircumcised men and ate with them!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But Peter explained <i>it</i> to them in order from the beginning, saying: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8220;I was in the city of Joppa praying; and in a trance I saw a vision, an object descending like a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came to me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>When I observed it intently and considered, I saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, creeping things, and birds of the air. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And I heard a voice saying to me, <span class="woj">&#8216;Rise, Peter; kill and eat.&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But I said, &#8216;Not so, Lord! For nothing common or unclean has at any time entered my mouth.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But the voice answered me again from heaven, <span class="woj">&#8216;What God has cleansed you must not call common.&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Now this was done three times, and all were drawn up again into heaven. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>At that very moment, three men stood before the house where I was, having been sent to me from Caesarea. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then the Spirit told me to go with them, doubting nothing. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered the man&#8217;s house. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And he told us how he had seen an angel standing in his house, who said to him, &#8216;Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon whose surname is Peter, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>who will tell you words by which you and all your household will be saved.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them, as upon us at the beginning. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then I remembered the word of the Lord, how He said, <span class="woj">&#8216;John indeed baptized with water, but</span> <span class="woj">you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>If therefore God gave them the same gift as <i>He gave</i> us when we believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could withstand God?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>When they heard these things they became silent; and they glorified God, saying, &#8220;Then God has also granted to the Gentiles repentance to life.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Barnabas and Saul at Antioch</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-11-19"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Now those who were scattered after the persecution that arose over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to no one but the Jews only. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>But some of them were men from Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they had come to Antioch, spoke to the Hellenists, preaching the Lord Jesus. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed and turned to the Lord.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then news of these things came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent out Barnabas to go as far as Antioch. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>When he came and had seen the grace of God, he was glad, and encouraged them all that with purpose of heart they should continue with the Lord. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>For he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a great many people were added to the Lord.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then Barnabas departed for Tarsus to seek Saul. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. So it was that for a whole year they assembled with the church and taught a great many people. And the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.</span></p> <h3>
Relief to Judea</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-11-27"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And in these days prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioch. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then one of them, named Agabus, stood up and showed by the Spirit that there was going to be a great famine throughout all the world, which also happened in the days of Claudius Caesar. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Then the disciples, each according to his ability, determined to send relief to the brethren dwelling in Judea. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>This they also did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.</span></p> </div></div></body></html>
