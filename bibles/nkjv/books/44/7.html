<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;Brethren and fathers, listen: The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and said to him, <span class="oblique">&#8216;Get out of your country and from your relatives, and come to a land that I will show you.&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then he came out of the land of the Chaldeans and dwelt in Haran. And from there, when his father was dead, He moved him to this land in which you now dwell. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And <i>God</i> gave him no inheritance in it, not even <i>enough</i> to set his foot on. But even when <i>Abraham</i> had no child, He promised to give it to him for a possession, and to his descendants after him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But God spoke in this way: that his descendants would dwell in a foreign land, and that they would bring them into bondage and oppress <i>them</i> four hundred years. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span><span class="oblique">&#8216;And the nation to whom they will be in bondage I will</span> <span class="oblique">judge,&#8217;</span> said God, <span class="oblique">&#8216;and after that they shall come out and serve Me in this place.&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then He gave him the covenant of circumcision; and so <i>Abraham</i> begot Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day; and Isaac <i>begot</i> Jacob, and Jacob <i>begot</i> the twelve patriarchs.</span></p> <h3>
The Patriarchs in Egypt</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-7-9"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;And the patriarchs, becoming envious, sold Joseph into Egypt. But God was with him </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and delivered him out of all his troubles, and gave him favor and wisdom in the presence of Pharaoh, king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now a famine and great <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>trouble came over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and our fathers found no sustenance. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And the second <i>time</i> Joseph was made known to his brothers, and Joseph&#8217;s family became known to the Pharaoh. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then Joseph sent and called his father Jacob and all his relatives to <i>him,</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>seventy-five people. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So Jacob went down to Egypt; and he died, he and our fathers. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And they were carried back to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a sum of money from the sons of Hamor, <i>the father</i> of Shechem.</span></p> <h3>
God Delivers Israel by Moses</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-7-17"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>&#8220;But when the time of the promise drew near which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>till another king arose who did not know Joseph. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>This man dealt treacherously with our people, and oppressed our forefathers, making them expose their babies, so that they might not live. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>At this time Moses was born, and was well pleasing to God; and he was brought up in his father&#8217;s house for three months. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>But when he was set out, Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter took him away and brought him up as her own son. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and deeds.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>&#8220;Now when he was forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren, the children of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And seeing one of <i>them</i> suffer wrong, he defended and avenged him who was oppressed, and struck down the Egyptian. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>For he supposed that his brethren would have understood that God would deliver them by his hand, but they did not understand. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And the next day he appeared to <i>two of</i> them as they were fighting, and <i>tried to</i> reconcile them, saying, &#8216;Men, you are brethren; why do you wrong one another?&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>But he who did his neighbor wrong pushed him away, saying, <span class="oblique">&#8216;Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span><span class="oblique">Do you want to kill me as you did the Egyptian yesterday?&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Then, at this saying, Moses fled and became a dweller in the land of Midian, where he had two sons.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>&#8220;And when forty years had passed, an Angel <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire in a bush, in the wilderness of Mount Sinai. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>When Moses saw <i>it,</i> he marveled at the sight; and as he drew near to observe, the voice of the Lord came to him, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span><i>saying,</i> <span class="oblique">&#8216;I</span> <i>am</i> <span class="oblique">the God of your fathers&#8212;the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.&#8217;</span> And Moses trembled and dared not look. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span><span class="oblique">&#8216;Then the</span> <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <span class="oblique">said to him, &#8220;Take your sandals off your feet, for the place where you stand is holy ground.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span><span class="oblique">I have surely</span> <span class="oblique">seen the oppression of My people who are in Egypt; I have heard their groaning and have come down to deliver them.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>&#8220;This Moses whom they rejected, saying, <span class="oblique">&#8216;Who made you a ruler and a judge?&#8217;</span> is the one God sent <i>to be</i> a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the Angel who appeared to him in the bush. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>He brought them out, after he had shown wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness forty years.</span></p> <h3>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>whom our fathers would not obey, but rejected. And in their hearts they turned back to Egypt, </span>
