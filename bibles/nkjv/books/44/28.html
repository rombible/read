<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/28-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And the natives<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span> showed us unusual kindness; for they kindled a fire and made us all welcome, because of the rain that was falling and because of the cold. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/28-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid <i>them</i> on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat, and fastened on his hand. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/28-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So when the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, &#8220;No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he has escaped the sea, yet justice does not allow to live.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/28-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But he shook off the creature into the fire and suffered no harm. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/28-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>However, they were expecting that he would swell up or suddenly fall down dead. But after they had looked for a long time and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/28-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>In that region there was an estate of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>leading citizen of the island, whose name was Publius, who received us and entertained us courteously for three days. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/28-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And it happened that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and dysentery. Paul went in to him and prayed, and he laid his hands on him and healed him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/28-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So when this was done, the rest of those on the island who had diseases also came and were healed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/28-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>They also honored us in many ways; and when we departed, they provided such things as were necessary.</span></p> <h3>
Arrival at Rome</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-28-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/28-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>After three months we sailed in an Alexandrian ship whose figurehead was the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Twin Brothers, which had wintered at the island. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/28-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And landing at Syracuse, we stayed three days. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/28-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>From there we circled round and reached Rhegium. And after one day the south wind blew; and the next day we came to Puteoli, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/28-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>where we found brethren, and were invited to stay with them seven days. And so we went toward Rome. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/28-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And from there, when the brethren heard about us, they came to meet us as far as Appii Forum and Three Inns. When Paul saw them, he thanked God and took courage.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/28-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Now when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard; but Paul was permitted to dwell by himself with the soldier who guarded him.</span></p> <h3>
Paul&#8217;s Ministry at Rome</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-28-17"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/28-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And it came to pass after three days that Paul called the leaders of the Jews together. So when they had come together, he said to them: &#8220;Men <i>and</i> brethren, though I have done nothing against our people or the customs of our fathers, yet I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/28-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>who, when they had examined me, wanted to let <i>me</i> go, because there was no cause for putting me to death. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/28-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>But when the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>Jews spoke against <i>it,</i> I was compelled to appeal to Caesar, not that I had anything of which to accuse my nation. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/28-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>For this reason therefore I have called for you, to see <i>you</i> and speak with <i>you,</i> because for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/28-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then they said to him, &#8220;We neither received letters from Judea concerning you, nor have any of the brethren who came reported or spoken any evil of you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/28-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But we desire to hear from you what you think; for concerning this sect, we know that it is spoken against everywhere.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/28-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>So when they had appointed him a day, many came to him at <i>his</i> lodging, to whom he explained and solemnly testified of the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus from both the Law of Moses and the Prophets, from morning till evening. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/28-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And some were persuaded by the things which were spoken, and some disbelieved. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/28-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>So when they did not agree among themselves, they departed after Paul had said one word: &#8220;The Holy Spirit spoke rightly through Isaiah the prophet to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>our fathers, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/28-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>saying,</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Acts-28-26"><span class="oblique">&#8216;Go to this people and say:</span></span><br /><span class="text Acts-28-26"><span class="oblique">&#8220;Hearing you will hear, and shall not understand;</span></span><br /><span class="text Acts-28-26"><span class="oblique">And seeing you will see, and not perceive;</span></span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/28-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span><span class="oblique">For the hearts of this people have grown dull.</span></span><br /><span class="text Acts-28-27"><i>Their</i> <span class="oblique">ears are hard of hearing,</span></span><br /><span class="text Acts-28-27"><span class="oblique">And their eyes they have closed,</span></span><br /><span class="text Acts-28-27"><span class="oblique">Lest they should see with</span> <i>their</i> <span class="oblique">eyes and hear with</span> <i>their</i> <span class="oblique">ears,</span></span><br /><span class="text Acts-28-27"><span class="oblique">Lest they should understand with</span> <i>their</i> <span class="oblique">hearts and turn,</span></span><br /><span class="text Acts-28-27"><span class="oblique">So that I should heal them.&#8221; &#8217;</span></span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/28-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>&#8220;Therefore let it be known to you that the salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will hear it!&#8221; </span> 
29<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>And when he had said these words, the Jews departed and had a great dispute among themselves.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/28-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Then Paul dwelt two whole years in his own rented house, and received all who came to him, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/28-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>preaching the kingdom of God and teaching the things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ with all confidence, no one forbidding him.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-27902a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 28:2">Acts 28:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>barbarians</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27907b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 28:7">Acts 28:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Magistrate</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27911c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 28:11">Acts 28:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Gr. <i>Dioskouroi,</i> Zeus&#8217;s sons Castor and Pollux</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27919d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 28:19">Acts 28:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'>The ruling authorities</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27925e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 28:25">Acts 28:25</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>your</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27929f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 28:29">Acts 28:29</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits v. <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Acts.28.29" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=Acts.28.29&amp;version=NKJV">29</span>.</span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
