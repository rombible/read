<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then the twelve summoned the multitude of the disciples and said, &#8220;It is not desirable that we should leave the word of God and serve tables. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Therefore, brethren, seek out from among you seven men of <i>good</i> reputation, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/6-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>but we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the word.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/6-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And the saying pleased the whole multitude. And they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit, and Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas, a proselyte from Antioch, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>whom they set before the apostles; and when they had prayed, they laid hands on them.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then the word of God spread, and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem, and a great many of the priests were obedient to the faith.</span></p> <h3>
Stephen Accused of Blasphemy</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-6-8"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And Stephen, full of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>faith and power, did great wonders and signs among the people. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then there arose some from what is called the Synagogue of the Freedmen (Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and those from Cilicia and Asia), disputing with Stephen. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/6-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/6-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then they secretly induced men to say, &#8220;We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/6-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And they stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes; and they came upon <i>him,</i> seized him, and brought <i>him</i> to the council. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/6-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>They also set up false witnesses who said, &#8220;This man does not cease to speak <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>blasphemous words against this holy place and the law; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/6-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs which Moses delivered to us.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/6-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And all who sat in the council, looking steadfastly at him, saw his face as the face of an angel.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-27103a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 6:1">Acts 6:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Greek-speaking Jews</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27110b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 6:8">Acts 6:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>grace</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27115c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 6:13">Acts 6:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>blasphemous</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
