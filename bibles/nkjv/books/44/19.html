And finding some disciples </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>he said to them, &#8220;Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Acts-19-2">So they said to him, &#8220;We have not so much as heard whether there is a Holy Spirit.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And he said to them, &#8220;Into what then were you baptized?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Acts-19-3">So they said, &#8220;Into John&#8217;s baptism.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then Paul said, &#8220;John indeed baptized with a baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe on Him who would come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>When they heard <i>this,</i> they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And when Paul had laid hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now the men were about twelve in all.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And he went into the synagogue and spoke boldly for three months, reasoning and persuading concerning the things of the kingdom of God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But when some were hardened and did not believe, but spoke evil of the Way before the multitude, he departed from them and withdrew the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And this continued for two years, so that all who dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.</span></p> <h3>
Miracles Glorify Christ</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-19-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now God worked unusual miracles by the hands of Paul, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>so that even handkerchiefs or aprons were brought from his body to the sick, and the diseases left them and the evil spirits went out of them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then some of the itinerant Jewish exorcists took it upon themselves to call the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>&#8220;We <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>exorcise you by the Jesus whom Paul preaches.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Also there were seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, who did so.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And the evil spirit answered and said, &#8220;Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>overpowered them, and prevailed against <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>This became known both to all Jews and Greeks dwelling in Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And many who had believed came confessing and telling their deeds. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Also, many of those who had practiced magic brought their books together and burned <i>them</i> in the sight of all. And they counted up the value of them, and <i>it</i> totaled fifty thousand <i>pieces</i> of silver. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So the word of the Lord grew mightily and prevailed.</span></p> <h3>
The Riot at Ephesus</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-19-21"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>When these things were accomplished, Paul purposed in the Spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, &#8220;After I have been there, I must also see Rome.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So he sent into Macedonia two of those who ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus, but he himself stayed in Asia for a time.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And about that time there arose a great commotion about the Way. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>Diana, brought no small profit to the craftsmen. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>He called them together with the workers of similar occupation, and said: &#8220;Men, you know that we have our prosperity by this trade. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Moreover you see and hear that not only at Ephesus, but throughout almost all Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away many people, saying that they are not gods which are made with hands. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>So not only is this trade of ours in danger of falling into disrepute, but also the temple of the great goddess Diana may be despised and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>her magnificence destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worship.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Now when they heard <i>this,</i> they were full of wrath and cried out, saying, &#8220;Great <i>is</i> Diana of the Ephesians!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>So the whole city was filled with confusion, and rushed into the theater with one accord, having seized Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians, Paul&#8217;s travel companions. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And when Paul wanted to go in to the people, the disciples would not allow him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Then some of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>officials of Asia, who were his friends, sent to him pleading that he would not venture into the theater. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Some therefore cried one thing and some another, for the assembly was confused, and most of them did not know why they had come together. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander motioned with his hand, and wanted to make his defense to the people. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>But when they found out that he was a Jew, all with one voice cried out for about two hours, &#8220;Great <i>is</i> Diana of the Ephesians!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>And when the city clerk had quieted the crowd, he said: &#8220;Men of Ephesus, what man is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple guardian of the great goddess <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>Diana, and of the <i>image</i> which fell down from <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>Zeus? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Therefore, since these things cannot be denied, you ought to be quiet and do nothing rashly. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>For you have brought these men here who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>your goddess. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>Therefore, if Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen have a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span>case against anyone, the courts are open and there are proconsuls. Let them bring charges against one another. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>But if you have any other inquiry to make, it shall be determined in the lawful assembly. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>For we are in danger of being <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[l]</a></span>called in question for today&#8217;s uproar, there being no reason which we may give to account for this disorderly gathering.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>And when he had said these things, he dismissed the assembly.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-27599a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 19:13">Acts 19:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>I</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27599b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 19:13">Acts 19:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>adjure,</i> solemnly command</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27602c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 19:16">Acts 19:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>M <i>and they overpowered them</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27602d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 19:16">Acts 19:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>both of them</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27610e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 19:24">Acts 19:24</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Gr. <i>Artemis</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27613f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 19:27">Acts 19:27</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>she be deposed from her magnificence</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27617g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 19:31">Acts 19:31</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Asiarchs, rulers of Asia,</i> the province</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27621h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 19:35">Acts 19:35</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Gr. <i>Artemis</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27621i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 19:35">Acts 19:35</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>heaven</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27623j"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 19:37">Acts 19:37</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>our</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27624k"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 19:38">Acts 19:38</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>matter</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27626l"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 19:40">Acts 19:40</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>charged with rebellion concerning today</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
