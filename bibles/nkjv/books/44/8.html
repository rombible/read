<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And devout men carried Stephen <i>to his burial,</i> and made great lamentation over him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>As for Saul, he made havoc of the church, entering every house, and dragging off men and women, committing <i>them</i> to prison.</span></p> <h3>
Christ Is Preached in Samaria</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-8-4"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Therefore those who were scattered went everywhere preaching the word. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then Philip went down to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>the city of Samaria and preached Christ to them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And the multitudes with one accord heeded the things spoken by Philip, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For unclean spirits, crying with a loud voice, came out of many who were possessed; and many who were paralyzed and lame were healed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And there was great joy in that city.</span></p> <h3>
The Sorcerer&#8217;s Profession of Faith</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-8-9"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But there was a certain man called Simon, who previously practiced <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>sorcery in the city and astonished the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>people of Samaria, claiming that he was someone great, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>to whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, &#8220;This man is the great power of God.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And they heeded him because he had astonished them with his <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>sorceries for a long time. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But when they believed Philip as he preached the things concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, both men and women were baptized. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then Simon himself also believed; and when he was baptized he continued with Philip, and was amazed, seeing the miracles and signs which were done.</span></p> <h3>
The Sorcerer&#8217;s Sin</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-8-14"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>who, when they had come down, prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>For as yet He had fallen upon none of them. They had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then they laid hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And when Simon saw that through the laying on of the apostles&#8217; hands the Holy Spirit was given, he offered them money, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>saying, &#8220;Give me this power also, that anyone on whom I lay hands may receive the Holy Spirit.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>But Peter said to him, &#8220;Your money perish with you, because you thought that the gift of God could be purchased with money! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>You have neither part nor portion in this matter, for your heart is not right in the sight of God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Repent therefore of this your wickedness, and pray God if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>For I see that you are poisoned by bitterness and bound by iniquity.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then Simon answered and said, &#8220;Pray to the Lord for me, that none of the things which you have spoken may come upon me.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>So when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.</span></p> <h3>
Christ Is Preached to an Ethiopian</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-8-26"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Now an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, &#8220;Arise and go toward the south along the road which goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.&#8221; This is <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>desert. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>So he arose and went. And behold, a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace the queen of the Ethiopians, who had charge of all her treasury, and had come to Jerusalem to worship, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>was returning. And sitting in his chariot, he was reading Isaiah the prophet. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Then the Spirit said to Philip, &#8220;Go near and overtake this chariot.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>So Philip ran to him, and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah, and said, &#8220;Do you understand what you are reading?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;How can I, unless someone guides me?&#8221; And he asked Philip to come up and sit with him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>The place in the Scripture which he read was this:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Acts-8-32"><span class="oblique">&#8220;He was led as a sheep to the slaughter;</span></span><br /><span class="text Acts-8-32"><span class="oblique">And as a lamb before its shearer</span> <i>is</i> <span class="oblique">silent,</span></span><br /><span class="text Acts-8-32"><span class="oblique">So He opened not His mouth.</span></span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span><span class="oblique">In His humiliation His</span> <span class="oblique">justice was taken away,</span></span><br /><span class="text Acts-8-33"><span class="oblique">And who will declare His generation?</span></span><br /><span class="text Acts-8-33"><span class="oblique">For His life is</span> <span class="oblique">taken from the earth.&#8221;</span></span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>So the eunuch answered Philip and said, &#8220;I ask you, of whom does the prophet say this, of himself or of some other man?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning at this Scripture, preached Jesus to him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Now as they went down the road, they came to some water. And the eunuch said, &#8220;See, <i>here is</i> water. What hinders me from being baptized?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
37<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>Then Philip said, &#8220;If you believe with all your heart, you may.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Acts-8-37">And he answered and said, &#8220;I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>So he commanded the chariot to stand still. And both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and he baptized him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>Now when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away, so that the eunuch saw him no more; and he went on his way rejoicing. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>But Philip was found at <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>Azotus. And passing through, he preached in all the cities till he came to Caesarea.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-27182a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 8:5">Acts 8:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>a</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27186b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 8:9">Acts 8:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>magic</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27186c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 8:9">Acts 8:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>nation</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27188d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 8:11">Acts 8:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>magic arts</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27203e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 8:26">Acts 8:26</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>a deserted place</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27214f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 8:37">Acts 8:37</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M omit v. <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Acts.8.37" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=Acts.8.37&amp;version=NKJV">37</span>.
