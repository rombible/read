<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>until the day in which <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>He was taken up, after He through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom He had chosen, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>to whom He also presented Himself alive after His suffering by many <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>infallible proofs, being seen by them during forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God.</span></p> <h3>
The Holy Spirit Promised</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-1-4"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And being assembled together with <i>them,</i> He commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the Promise of the Father, <span class="woj">&#8220;which,&#8221;</span> <i>He said,</i> <span class="woj">&#8220;you have</span> <span class="woj">heard from Me;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span><span class="woj">for John truly baptized with water,</span> <span class="woj">but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Therefore, when they had come together, they asked Him, saying, &#8220;Lord, will You at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;It is not for you to</span> <span class="woj">know times or seasons which the Father has put in His own authority.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><span class="woj">But you shall receive power</span> <span class="woj">when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and</span> <span class="woj">you shall be</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span><span class="woj">witnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and</span> <span class="woj">Samaria, and to the</span> <span class="woj">end of the earth.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Jesus Ascends to Heaven</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-1-9"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Now when He had spoken these things, while they watched, He was taken up, and a cloud received Him out of their sight. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as He went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>who also said, &#8220;Men of Galilee, why do you stand gazing up into heaven? This <i>same</i> Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will so come in like manner as you saw Him go into heaven.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
The Upper Room Prayer Meeting</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-1-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day&#8217;s journey. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And when they had entered, they went up into the upper room where they were staying: Peter, James, John, and Andrew; Philip and Thomas; Bartholomew and Matthew; James <i>the son</i> of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot; and Judas <i>the son</i> of James. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>These all continued with one <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>accord in prayer <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>and supplication, with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His brothers.</span></p> <h3>
Matthias Chosen</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-1-15"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>disciples (altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty), and said, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>&#8220;Men <i>and</i> brethren, this Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>(Now this man purchased a field with the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>wages of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>entrails gushed out. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem; so that field is called in their own language, Akel Dama, that is, Field of Blood.)</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>&#8220;For it is written in the Book of Psalms:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Acts-1-20"><span class="oblique">&#8216;Let his dwelling place be</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span><span class="oblique">desolate,</span></span><br /><span class="text Acts-1-20"><span class="oblique">And let no one live in it&#8217;</span>;</span></p></div><p class="first-line-none top-1"><span class="text Acts-1-20">and,</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Acts-1-20"><span class="oblique">&#8216;Let another take his</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span><span class="oblique">office.&#8217;</span></span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>&#8220;Therefore, of these men who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>beginning from the baptism of John to that day when He was taken up from us, one of these must become a witness with us of His resurrection.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And they proposed two: Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And they prayed and said, &#8220;You, O Lord, who know the hearts of all, show which of these two You have chosen </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>to take part in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And they cast their lots, and the lot fell on Matthias.
