<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And a certain man lame from his mother&#8217;s womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>ask alms from those who entered the temple; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>who, seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, asked for alms. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And fixing his eyes on him, with John, Peter said, &#8220;Look at us.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So he gave them his attention, expecting to receive something from them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then Peter said, &#8220;Silver and gold I do not have, but what I do have I give you: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And he took him by the right hand and lifted <i>him</i> up, and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So he, leaping up, stood and walked and entered the temple with them&#8212;walking, leaping, and praising God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And all the people saw him walking and praising God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then they knew that it was he who sat begging alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple; and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.</span></p> <h3>
Preaching in Solomon&#8217;s Portico</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-3-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now as the lame man who was healed held on to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch which is called Solomon&#8217;s, greatly amazed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So when Peter saw <i>it,</i> he responded to the people: &#8220;Men of Israel, why do you marvel at this? Or why look so intently at us, as though by our own power or godliness we had made this man walk? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, glorified His Servant Jesus, whom you delivered up and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let <i>Him</i> go. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But you denied the Holy One and the Just, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and killed the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>Prince of life, whom God raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/3-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And His name, through faith in His name, has made this man strong, whom you see and know. Yes, the faith which <i>comes</i> through Him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>&#8220;Yet now, brethren, I know that you did <i>it</i> in ignorance, as <i>did</i> also your rulers. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/3-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>But those things which God foretold by the mouth of all His prophets, that the Christ would suffer, He has thus fulfilled. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/3-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Repent therefore and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/3-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>and that He may send <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Jesus Christ, who was <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>preached to you before, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/3-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>whom heaven must receive until the times of restoration of all things, which God has spoken by the mouth of all His holy prophets since <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>the world began. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/3-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>For Moses truly said to the fathers, <span class="oblique">&#8216;The</span> <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <span class="oblique">your God will raise up for you a Prophet like me from your brethren.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/3-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Yes, and all the prophets, from Samuel and those who follow, as many as have spoken, have also <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>foretold these days. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/3-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>You are sons of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying to Abraham, <span class="oblique">&#8216;And in your seed all the families of the earth shall be blessed.&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/3-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>To you first, God, having raised up His Servant Jesus, sent Him to bless you, in turning away every one <i>of you</i> from your iniquities.&#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-26999a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 3:2">Acts 3:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Beg</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27012b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 3:15">Acts 3:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>Originator</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27017c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 3:20">Acts 3:20</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M <i>Christ Jesus</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27017d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 3:20">Acts 3:20</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M <i>ordained for you before</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27018e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 3:21">Acts 3:21</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>time</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27021f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 3:24">Acts 3:24</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M <i>proclaimed</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
