<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/20-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Now when he had gone over that region and encouraged them with many words, he came to Greece </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/20-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and stayed three months. And when the Jews plotted against him as he was about to sail to Syria, he decided to return through Macedonia. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/20-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And Sopater of Berea accompanied him to Asia&#8212;also Aristarchus and Secundus of the Thessalonians, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/20-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>These men, going ahead, waited for us at Troas. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/20-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But we sailed away from Philippi after the Days of Unleavened Bread, and in five days joined them at Troas, where we stayed seven days.</span></p> <h3>
Ministering at Troas</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-20-7"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/20-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now on the first <i>day</i> of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul, ready to depart the next day, spoke to them and continued his message until midnight. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/20-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>There were many lamps in the upper room where <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>they were gathered together. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/20-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And in a window sat a certain young man named Eutychus, who was sinking into a deep sleep. He was overcome by sleep; and as Paul continued speaking, he fell down from the third story and was taken up dead. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/20-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>But Paul went down, fell on him, and embracing <i>him</i> said, &#8220;Do not trouble yourselves, for his life is in him.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/20-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now when he had come up, had broken bread and eaten, and talked a long while, even till daybreak, he departed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/20-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And they brought the young man in alive, and they were not a little comforted.</span></p> <h3>
From Troas to Miletus</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-20-13"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/20-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then we went ahead to the ship and sailed to Assos, there intending to take Paul on board; for so he had <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>given orders, intending himself to go on foot. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/20-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and came to Mitylene. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/20-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>We sailed from there, and the next <i>day</i> came opposite Chios. The following <i>day</i> we arrived at Samos and stayed at Trogyllium. The next <i>day</i> we came to Miletus. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/20-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus, so that he would not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hurrying to be at Jerusalem, if possible, on the Day of Pentecost.</span></p> <h3>
The Ephesian Elders Exhorted</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-20-17"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/20-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>From Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called for the elders of the church. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/20-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And when they had come to him, he said to them: &#8220;You know, from the first day that I came to Asia, in what manner I always lived among you, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/20-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>serving the Lord with all humility, with many tears and trials which happened to me by the plotting of the Jews; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/20-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>how I kept back nothing that was helpful, but proclaimed it to you, and taught you publicly and from house to house, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/20-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>testifying to Jews, and also to Greeks, repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/20-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And see, now I go bound in the spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that will happen to me there, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/20-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>except that the Holy Spirit testifies in every city, saying that chains and tribulations await me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/20-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>But none of these things move me; nor do I count my life dear to myself, so that I may finish my <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>race with joy, and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/20-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>&#8220;And indeed, now I know that you all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, will see my face no more. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/20-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Therefore I testify to you this day that I <i>am</i> innocent<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span> of the blood of all <i>men.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/20-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>For I have not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>shunned to declare to you the whole counsel of God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/20-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Therefore take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>of God which He purchased with His own blood. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/20-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>For I know this, that after my departure savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/20-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Also from among yourselves men will rise up, speaking <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>perverse things, to draw away the disciples after themselves. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/20-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Therefore watch, and remember that for three years I did not cease to warn everyone night and day with tears.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/20-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>&#8220;So now, brethren, I commend you to God and to the word of His grace, which is able to build you up and give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/20-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>I have coveted no one&#8217;s silver or gold or apparel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/20-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>Yes, you yourselves know that these hands have provided for my necessities, and for those who were with me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/20-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>I have shown you in every way, by laboring like this, that you must support the weak. And remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that He said, <span class="woj">&#8216;It is more blessed to give than to receive.&#8217;</span> &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/20-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>And when he had said these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/20-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>Then they all wept <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>freely, and fell on Paul&#8217;s neck and kissed him, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/20-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>sorrowing most of all for the words which he spoke, that they would see his face no more. And they accompanied him to the ship.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-27635a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 20:8">Acts 20:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M <i>we</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27640b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 20:13">Acts 20:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>arranged it</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27651c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 20:24">Acts 20:24</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>But I do not count my life of any value or dear to myself</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27651d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 20:24">Acts 20:24</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>course</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27653e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 20:26">Acts 20:26</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>clean</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27654f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 20:27">Acts 20:27</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>avoided declaring</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27655g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 20:28">Acts 20:28</span> <span class='footnote-text'>M <i>of the Lord and God</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27657h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 20:30">Acts 20:30</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>misleading</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27661i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 20:34">Acts 20:34</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M omit <i>Yes</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27664j"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 20:37">Acts 20:37</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>much</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
