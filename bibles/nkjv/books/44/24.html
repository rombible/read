These gave evidence to the governor against Paul.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And when he was called upon, Tertullus began his accusation, saying: &#8220;Seeing that through you we enjoy great peace, and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>prosperity is being brought to this nation by your foresight, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>we accept <i>it</i> always and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Nevertheless, not to be tedious to you any further, I beg you to hear, by your <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>courtesy, a few words from us. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For we have found this man a plague, a creator of dissension among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>He even tried to profane the temple, and we seized him, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>and wanted to judge him according to our law. </span> 
7But the commander Lysias came by and with great violence took <i>him</i> out of our hands, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>commanding his accusers to come to you. By examining him yourself you may ascertain all these things of which we accuse him.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And the Jews also <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>assented, maintaining that these things were so.</span></p> <h3>
The Defense Before Felix</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-24-10"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then Paul, after the governor had nodded to him to speak, answered: &#8220;Inasmuch as I know that you have been for many years a judge of this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>because you may ascertain that it is no more than twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And they neither found me in the temple disputing with anyone nor inciting the crowd, either in the synagogues or in the city. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Nor can they prove the things of which they now accuse me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But this I confess to you, that according to the Way which they call a sect, so I worship the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the Law and in the Prophets. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>I have hope in God, which they themselves also accept, that there will be a resurrection <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>of <i>the</i> dead, both of <i>the</i> just and <i>the</i> unjust. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>This <i>being</i> so, I myself always strive to have a conscience without offense toward God and men.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>&#8220;Now after many years I came to bring alms and offerings to my nation, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>in the midst of which some Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with a mob nor with tumult. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>They ought to have been here before you to object if they had anything against me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Or else let those who are <i>here</i> themselves say <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>if they found any wrongdoing in me while I stood before the council, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>unless <i>it is</i> for this one statement which I cried out, standing among them, &#8216;Concerning the resurrection of the dead I am being judged by you this day.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Felix Procrastinates</span></h3><p><span class="text Acts-24-22"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But when Felix heard these things, having more accurate knowledge of <i>the</i> Way, he adjourned the proceedings and said, &#8220;When Lysias the commander comes down, I will make a decision on your case.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>So he commanded the centurion to keep Paul and to let <i>him</i> have liberty, and told him not to forbid any of his friends to provide for or visit him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And after some days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish, he sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in Christ. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Now as he reasoned about righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was afraid and answered, &#8220;Go away for now; when I have a convenient time I will call for you.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Meanwhile he also hoped that money would be given him by Paul, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>that he might release him. Therefore he sent for him more often and conversed with him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>But after two years Porcius Festus succeeded Felix; and Felix, wanting to do the Jews a favor, left Paul bound.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-27772a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 24:2">Acts 24:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>reforms are</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27774b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 24:4">Acts 24:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>graciousness</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27776c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 24:6">Acts 24:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU ends the sentence here and omits the rest of v. <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Acts.24.6" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=Acts.24.6&amp;version=NKJV">6</span>, all of v. <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Acts.24.7" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=Acts.24.7&amp;version=NKJV">7</span>, and the first clause of v. <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Acts.24.8" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=Acts.24.8&amp;version=NKJV">8</span>.</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27779d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 24:9">Acts 24:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M <i>joined the attack</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27785e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 24:15">Acts 24:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>of the dead</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27790f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 24:20">Acts 24:20</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M <i>what wrongdoing they found</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-27796g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Acts 24:26">Acts 24:26</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>that he might release him</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
