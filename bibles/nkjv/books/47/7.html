The Corinthians&#8217; Repentance</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Cor-7-2"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Open <i>your hearts</i> to us. We have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have cheated no one. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>I do not say <i>this</i> to condemn; for I have said before that you are in our hearts, to die together and to live together. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Great <i>is</i> my boldness of speech toward you, great <i>is</i> my boasting on your behalf. I am filled with comfort. I am exceedingly joyful in all our tribulation.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For indeed, when we came to Macedonia, our bodies had no rest, but we were troubled on every side. Outside <i>were</i> conflicts, inside <i>were</i> fears. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Nevertheless God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us by the coming of Titus, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and not only by his coming, but also by the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>consolation with which he was comforted in you, when he told us of your earnest desire, your mourning, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced even more.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For even if I made you sorry with my letter, I do not regret it; though I did regret it. For I perceive that the same epistle made you sorry, though only for a while. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Now I rejoice, not that you were made sorry, but that your sorrow led to repentance. For you were made sorry in a godly manner, that you might suffer loss from us in nothing. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For godly sorrow produces repentance <i>leading</i> to salvation, not to be regretted; but the sorrow of the world produces death. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For observe this very thing, that you sorrowed in a godly manner: What diligence it produced in you, <i>what</i> clearing <i>of yourselves, what</i> indignation, <i>what</i> fear, <i>what</i> vehement desire, <i>what</i> zeal, <i>what</i> vindication! In all <i>things</i> you proved yourselves to be clear in this matter. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Therefore, although I wrote to you, <i>I did</i> not <i>do it</i> for the sake of him who had done the wrong, nor for the sake of him who suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear to you.</span></p> <h3>
The Joy of Titus</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Cor-7-13"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Therefore we have been comforted in your comfort. And we rejoiced exceedingly more for the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For if in anything I have boasted to him about you, I am not ashamed. But as we spoke all things to you in truth, even so our boasting to Titus was found true. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And his affections are greater for you as he remembers the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling you received him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Therefore I rejoice that I have confidence in you in everything.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-28924a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Corinthians 7:7">2 Corinthians 7:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>comfort</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
