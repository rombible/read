<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>For I am jealous for you with godly jealousy. For I have betrothed you to one husband, that I may present <i>you</i> <i>as</i> a chaste virgin to Christ. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But I fear, lest somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, so your minds may be corrupted from the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>simplicity that is in Christ. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For if he who comes preaches another Jesus whom we have not preached, or <i>if</i> you receive a different spirit which you have not received, or a different gospel which you have not accepted&#8212;you may well put up with it!</span></p> <h3>
Paul and False Apostles</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Cor-11-5"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For I consider that I am not at all inferior to the most eminent apostles. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Even though <i>I am</i> untrained in speech, yet <i>I am</i> not in knowledge. But we have <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>been thoroughly manifested among you in all things.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Did I commit sin in <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>humbling myself that you might be exalted, because I preached the gospel of God to you free of charge? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>I robbed other churches, taking wages <i>from them</i> to minister to you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And when I was present with you, and in need, I was a burden to no one, for what I lacked the brethren who came from Macedonia supplied. And in everything I kept myself from being burdensome to you, and so I will keep <i>myself</i>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>As the truth of Christ is in me, no one shall stop me from this boasting in the regions of Achaia. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Why? Because I do not love you? God knows!</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But what I do, I will also continue to do, that I may cut off the opportunity from those who desire an opportunity to be regarded just as we are in the things of which they boast. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For such <i>are</i> false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into apostles of Christ. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And no wonder! For Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Therefore <i>it is</i> no great thing if his ministers also transform themselves into ministers of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works.</span></p> <h3>
Reluctant Boasting</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Cor-11-16"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>I say again, let no one think me a fool. If otherwise, at least receive me as a fool, that I also may boast a little. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>What I speak, I speak not according to the Lord, but as it were, foolishly, in this confidence of boasting. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Seeing that many boast according to the flesh, I also will boast. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>For you put up with fools gladly, since you <i>yourselves</i> are wise! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>For you put up with it if one brings you into bondage, if one devours <i>you,</i> if one takes <i>from you,</i> if one exalts himself, if one strikes you on the face. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>To <i>our</i> shame I say that we were too weak for that! But in whatever anyone is bold&#8212;I speak foolishly&#8212;I am bold also.</span></p> <h3>
Suffering for Christ</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Cor-11-22"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Are they Hebrews? So <i>am</i> I. Are they Israelites? So <i>am</i> I. Are they the seed of Abraham? So <i>am</i> I. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Are they ministers of Christ?&#8212;I speak as a fool&#8212;I <i>am</i> more: in labors more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequently, in deaths often. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>From the Jews five times I received forty <i>stripes</i> minus one. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Three times I was beaten with rods; once I was stoned; three times I was shipwrecked; a night and a day I have been in the deep; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span><i>in</i> journeys often, <i>in</i> perils of waters, <i>in</i> perils of robbers, <i>in</i> perils of <i>my own</i> countrymen, <i>in</i> perils of the Gentiles, <i>in</i> perils in the city, <i>in</i> perils in the wilderness, <i>in</i> perils in the sea, <i>in</i> perils among false brethren; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>in weariness and toil, in sleeplessness often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>besides the other things, what comes upon me daily: my deep concern for all the churches. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to stumble, and I do not burn <i>with indignation?</i></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>If I must boast, I will boast in the things which concern my <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>infirmity. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed forever, knows that I am not lying. </span>
