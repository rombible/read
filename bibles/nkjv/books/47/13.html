<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>I have told you before, and foretell as if I were present the second time, and now being absent <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>I write to those who have sinned before, and to all the rest, that if I come again I will not spare&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>since you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, who is not weak toward you, but mighty in you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For though He was crucified in weakness, yet He lives by the power of God. For we also are weak in Him, but we shall live with Him by the power of God toward you.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Examine yourselves <i>as to</i> whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Do you not know yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you?&#8212;unless indeed you <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>are disqualified. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But I trust that you will know that we are not disqualified.</span></p> <h3>
Paul Prefers Gentleness</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Cor-13-7"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>I pray to God that you do no evil, not that we should appear approved, but that you should do what is honorable, though we may seem disqualified. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For we are glad when we are weak and you are strong. And this also we pray, that you may be made complete. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the authority which the Lord has given me for edification and not for destruction.</span></p> <h3>
Greetings and Benediction</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Cor-13-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Finally, brethren, farewell.
