I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago&#8212;whether in the body I do not know, or whether out of the body I do not know, God knows&#8212;such a one was caught up to the third heaven. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And I know such a man&#8212;whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>how he was caught up into Paradise and heard inexpressible words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Of such a one I will boast; yet of myself I will not boast, except in my infirmities. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>For though I might desire to boast, I will not be a fool; for I will speak the truth. But I refrain, lest anyone should think of me above what he sees me <i>to be</i> or hears from me.</span></p> <h3>
The Thorn in the Flesh</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Cor-12-7"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And lest I should be exalted above measure by the abundance of the revelations, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>buffet me, lest I be exalted above measure. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Concerning this thing I pleaded with the Lord three times that it might depart from me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And He said to me, <span class="woj">&#8220;My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.&#8221;</span> Therefore most gladly I will rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in needs, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ&#8217;s sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong.</span></p> <h3>
Signs of an Apostle</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Cor-12-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>I have become a fool <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>in boasting; you have compelled me. For I ought to have been commended by you; for in nothing was I behind the most eminent apostles, though I am nothing. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Truly the signs of an apostle were accomplished among you with all perseverance, in signs and wonders and mighty deeds. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For what is it in which you were inferior to other churches, except that I myself was not burdensome to you? Forgive me this wrong!</span></p> <h3>
Love for the Church</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Cor-12-14"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Now <i>for</i> the third time I am ready to come to you. And I will not be burdensome to you; for I do not seek yours, but you. For the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And I will very gladly spend and be spent for your souls; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I am loved.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But be that <i>as it may,</i> I did not burden you. Nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you by cunning! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Did I take advantage of you by any of those whom I sent to you? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>I urged Titus, and sent our brother with <i>him.</i> Did Titus take advantage of you? Did we not walk in the same spirit? Did <i>we</i> not <i>walk</i> in the same steps?</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Again, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>do you think that we excuse ourselves to you? We speak before God in Christ. But <i>we do</i> all things, beloved, for your edification. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>For I fear lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I wish, and <i>that</i> I shall be found by you such as you do not wish; lest <i>there be</i> contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, backbitings, whisperings, conceits, tumults; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and I shall mourn for many who have sinned before and have not repented of the uncleanness, fornication, and lewdness which they have practiced.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-29024a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Corinthians 12:1">2 Corinthians 12:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>necessary, though not profitable, to boast</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29030b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Corinthians 12:7">2 Corinthians 12:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>beat</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29034c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Corinthians 12:11">2 Corinthians 12:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>in boasting</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29042d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Corinthians 12:19">2 Corinthians 12:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>You have been thinking for a long time that we</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
