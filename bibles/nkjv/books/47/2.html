<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>For if I make you sorrowful, then who is he who makes me glad but the one who is made sorrowful by me?</span></p> <h3>
Forgive the Offender</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Cor-2-3"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And I wrote this very thing to you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow over those from whom I ought to have joy, having confidence in you all that my joy is <i>the joy</i> of you all. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For out of much <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you, with many tears, not that you should be grieved, but that you might know the love which I have so abundantly for you.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But if anyone has caused grief, he has not grieved me, but all of you to some extent&#8212;not to be too severe. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>This punishment which <i>was inflicted</i> by the majority <i>is</i> sufficient for such a man, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>so that, on the contrary, you <i>ought</i> rather to forgive and comfort <i>him</i>, lest perhaps such a one be swallowed up with too much sorrow. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Therefore I urge you to reaffirm <i>your</i> love to him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For to this end I also wrote, that I might put you to the test, whether you are obedient in all things. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Now whom you forgive anything, I also <i>forgive</i>. For <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>if indeed I have forgiven anything, I have forgiven that one for your sakes in the presence of Christ, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>lest Satan should take advantage of us; for we are not ignorant of his devices.</span></p> <h3>
Triumph in Christ</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Cor-2-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Furthermore, when I came to Troas to <i>preach</i> Christ&#8217;s gospel, and a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>door was opened to me by the Lord, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>I had no rest in my spirit, because I did not find Titus my brother; but taking my leave of them, I departed for Macedonia.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Now thanks <i>be</i> to God who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and through us <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>diffuses the fragrance of His knowledge in every place. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>For we are to God the fragrance of Christ among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>To the one <i>we are</i> the aroma of death <i>leading</i> to death, and to the other the aroma of life <i>leading</i> to life. And who <i>is</i> sufficient for these things? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>For we are not, as <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>so many, peddling<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span> the word of God; but as of sincerity, but as from God, we speak in the sight of God in Christ.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-28829a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Corinthians 2:4">2 Corinthians 2:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>tribulation</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28835b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Corinthians 2:10">2 Corinthians 2:10</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>indeed, what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, I did it for your sakes</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28837c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Corinthians 2:12">2 Corinthians 2:12</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Opportunity</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28839d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Corinthians 2:14">2 Corinthians 2:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>manifests</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28842e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Corinthians 2:17">2 Corinthians 2:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'>M <i>the rest</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28842f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Corinthians 2:17">2 Corinthians 2:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>adulterating for gain</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
