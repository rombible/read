<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>But we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness nor <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>handling the word of God deceitfully, but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man&#8217;s conscience in the sight of God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>whose minds the god of this age has blinded, who do not believe, lest the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine on them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your bondservants for Jesus&#8217; sake. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>For it is the God who commanded light to shine out of darkness, who has shone in our hearts to <i>give</i> the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.</span></p> <h3>
Cast Down but Unconquered</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Cor-4-7"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><i>We are</i> hard-pressed on every side, yet not crushed; <i>we are</i> perplexed, but not in despair; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>always carrying about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus&#8217; sake, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So then death is working in us, but life in you.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And since we have the same spirit of faith, according to what is written, <span class="oblique">&#8220;I believed and therefore I spoke,&#8221;</span> we also believe and therefore speak, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>knowing that He who raised up the Lord Jesus will also raise us up with Jesus, and will present <i>us</i> with you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>For all things <i>are</i> for your sakes, that grace, having spread through the many, may cause thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God.</span></p> <h3>
Seeing the Invisible</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Cor-4-16"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Therefore we do not lose heart. Even though our outward man is perishing, yet the inward <i>man</i> is being renewed day by day. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, is working for us a far more exceeding <i>and</i> eternal weight of glory, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>while we do not look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen <i>are</i> temporary, but the things which are not seen <i>are</i> eternal.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-28862a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Corinthians 4:2">2 Corinthians 4:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>adulterating the word of God</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
