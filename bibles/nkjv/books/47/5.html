<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed with our <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>habitation which is from heaven, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>if indeed, having been clothed, we shall not be found naked. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For we who are in <i>this</i> tent groan, being burdened, not because we want to be unclothed, but further clothed, that mortality may be swallowed up by life. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now He who has prepared us for this very thing <i>is</i> God, who also has given us the Spirit as <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>a guarantee.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So <i>we are</i> always confident, knowing that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For we walk by faith, not by sight. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>We are confident, yes, well pleased rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord.</span></p> <h3>
The Judgment Seat of Christ</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Cor-5-9"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Therefore we make it our aim, whether present or absent, to be well pleasing to Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things <i>done</i> in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Knowing, therefore, the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are well known to God, and I also trust are well known in your consciences.</span></p> <h3>
Be Reconciled to God</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Cor-5-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>For we do not commend ourselves again to you, but give you opportunity to boast on our behalf, that you may have <i>an answer</i> for those who boast in appearance and not in heart. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For if we are beside ourselves, <i>it is</i> for God; or if we are of sound mind, <i>it is</i> for you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For the love of Christ compels us, because we judge thus: that if One died for all, then all died; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and He died for all, that those who live should live no longer for themselves, but for Him who died for them and rose again.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Therefore, from now on, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know <i>Him thus</i> no longer. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Therefore, if anyone <i>is</i> in Christ, <i>he is</i> a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Now all things <i>are</i> of God, who has reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>that is, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>imputing their trespasses to them, and has committed to us the word of reconciliation.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were pleading through us: we implore <i>you</i> on Christ&#8217;s behalf, be reconciled to God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>For He made Him who knew no sin <i>to be</i> sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-28879a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Corinthians 5:1">2 Corinthians 5:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Physical body</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28880b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Corinthians 5:2">2 Corinthians 5:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>dwelling</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28883c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Corinthians 5:5">2 Corinthians 5:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>down payment, earnest</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28897d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Corinthians 5:19">2 Corinthians 5:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>reckoning</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
