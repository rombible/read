<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>But I beg <i>you</i> that when I am present I may not be bold with that confidence by which I intend to be bold against some, who think of us as if we walked according to the flesh. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For the weapons of our warfare <i>are</i> not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>carnal but mighty in God for pulling down strongholds, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and being ready to punish all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled.</span></p> <h3>
Reality of Paul&#8217;s Authority</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Cor-10-7"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Do you look at things according to the outward appearance? If anyone is convinced in himself that he is Christ&#8217;s, let him again consider this in himself, that just as he <i>is</i> Christ&#8217;s, even <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>so we <i>are</i> Christ&#8217;s. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For even if I should boast somewhat more about our authority, which the Lord gave <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>us for <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>edification and not for your destruction, I shall not be ashamed&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>lest I seem to terrify you by letters. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8220;For <i>his</i> letters,&#8221; they say, &#8220;<i>are</i> weighty and powerful, but <i>his</i> bodily presence <i>is</i> weak, and <i>his</i> speech contemptible.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Let such a person consider this, that what we are in word by letters when we are absent, such <i>we will</i> also <i>be</i> in deed when we are present.</span></p> <h3>
Limits of Paul&#8217;s Authority</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Cor-10-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>For we dare not class ourselves or compare ourselves with those who commend themselves. But they, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>We, however, will not boast beyond measure, but within the limits of the sphere which God appointed us&#8212;a sphere which especially includes you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For we are not overextending ourselves (as though <i>our authority</i> did not extend to you), for it was to you that we came with the gospel of Christ; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>not boasting of things beyond measure, <i>that is,</i> in other men&#8217;s labors, but having hope, <i>that</i> as your faith is increased, we shall be greatly enlarged by you in our sphere, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>to preach the gospel in the <i>regions</i> beyond you, <i>and</i> not to boast in another man&#8217;s sphere of accomplishment.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But <span class="oblique">&#8220;he who glories, let him glory in the</span> <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span><span class="oblique">.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>For not he who commends himself is approved, but whom the Lord commends.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-28976a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Corinthians 10:4">2 Corinthians 10:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>of the flesh</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28979b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Corinthians 10:7">2 Corinthians 10:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>as we are.</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28980c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Corinthians 10:8">2 Corinthians 10:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>us</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28980d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Corinthians 10:8">2 Corinthians 10:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>building up</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
