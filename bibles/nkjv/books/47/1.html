<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p> <h3>
Comfort in Suffering</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Cor-1-3"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Blessed <i>be</i> the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>who comforts us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort those who are in any <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>trouble, with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>consolation also abounds through Christ. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now if we are afflicted, <i>it is</i> for your consolation and salvation, which is effective for enduring the same sufferings which we also suffer. Or if we are comforted, <i>it is</i> for your consolation and salvation. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And our hope for you <i>is</i> steadfast, because we know that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so also <i>you will partake</i> of the consolation.</span></p> <h3>
Delivered from Suffering</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Cor-1-8"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For we do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, of our <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>trouble which came to us in Asia: that we were burdened beyond measure, above strength, so that we despaired even of life. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Yes, we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves but in God who raises the dead, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>who delivered us from so great a death, and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>does deliver us; in whom we trust that He will still deliver <i>us,</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>you also helping together in prayer for us, that thanks may be given by many persons on <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>our behalf for the gift <i>granted</i> to us through many.</span></p> <h3>
Paul&#8217;s Sincerity</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Cor-1-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>For our boasting is this: the testimony of our conscience that we conducted ourselves in the world in <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom but by the grace of God, and more abundantly toward you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For we are not writing any other things to you than what you read or understand. Now I trust you will understand, even to the end </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>(as also you have understood us in part), that we are your boast as you also <i>are</i> ours, in the day of the Lord Jesus.</span></p> <h3>
Sparing the Church</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Cor-1-15"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And in this confidence I intended to come to you before, that you might have a second benefit&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>to pass by way of you to Macedonia, to come again from Macedonia to you, and be helped by you on my way to Judea. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Therefore, when I was planning this, did I do it lightly? Or the things I plan, do I plan according to the flesh, that with me there should be Yes, Yes, and No, No? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>But <i>as</i> God <i>is</i> faithful, our <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>word to you was not Yes and No. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us&#8212;by me, Silvanus, and Timothy&#8212;was not Yes and No, but in Him was Yes. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>For all the promises of God in Him <i>are</i> Yes, and in Him Amen, to the glory of God through us. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Now He who establishes us with you in Christ and has anointed us <i>is</i> God, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>who also has sealed us and given us the Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Moreover I call God as witness against my soul, that to spare you I came no more to Corinth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Not that we <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>have dominion over your faith, but are fellow workers for your joy; for by faith you stand.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-28805a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Corinthians 1:4">2 Corinthians 1:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>tribulation</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28806b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Corinthians 1:5">2 Corinthians 1:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>comfort</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28809c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Corinthians 1:8">2 Corinthians 1:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>tribulation</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28811d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Corinthians 1:10">2 Corinthians 1:10</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>shall</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28812e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Corinthians 1:11">2 Corinthians 1:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>M <i>your behalf</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28813f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Corinthians 1:12">2 Corinthians 1:12</span> <span class='footnote-text'>The opposite of duplicity</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28819g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Corinthians 1:18">2 Corinthians 1:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>message</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28825h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Corinthians 1:24">2 Corinthians 1:24</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>rule</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
