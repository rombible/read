<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded in the riches of their liberality. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For I bear witness that according to <i>their</i> ability, yes, and beyond <i>their</i> ability, <i>they were</i> freely willing, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>imploring us with much urgency <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>that we would receive the gift and the fellowship of the ministering to the saints. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And not <i>only</i> as we had hoped, but they first gave themselves to the Lord, and <i>then</i> to us by the will of God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So we urged Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also complete this grace in you as well. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But as you abound in everything&#8212;in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in all diligence, and in your love for us&#8212;<i>see</i> that you abound in this grace also.</span></p> <h3>
Christ Our Pattern</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Cor-8-8"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>I speak not by commandment, but I am testing the sincerity of your love by the diligence of others. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that you through His poverty might become rich.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And in this I give advice: It is to your advantage not only to be doing what you began and were desiring to do a year ago; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>but now you also must complete the doing <i>of it;</i> that as <i>there was</i> a readiness to desire <i>it,</i> so <i>there</i> also <i>may be</i> a completion out of what <i>you</i> have. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>For if there is first a willing mind, <i>it is</i> accepted according to what one has, <i>and</i> not according to what he does not have.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For <i>I do</i> not <i>mean</i> that others should be eased and you burdened; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>but by an equality, <i>that</i> now at this time your abundance <i>may supply</i> their lack, that their abundance also may <i>supply</i> your lack&#8212;that there may be equality. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>As it is written, <span class="oblique">&#8220;He who</span> <i>gathered</i> <span class="oblique">much had nothing left over, and he who</span> <i>gathered</i> <span class="oblique">little had no lack.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Collection for the Judean Saints</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Cor-8-16"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But thanks <i>be</i> to God who <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>puts the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>For he not only accepted the exhortation, but being more diligent, he went to you of his own accord. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And we have sent with him the brother whose praise <i>is</i> in the gospel throughout all the churches, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>and not only <i>that,</i> but who was also chosen by the churches to travel with us with this gift, which is administered by us to the glory of the Lord Himself and <i>to show</i> your ready mind, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>avoiding this: that anyone should blame us in this lavish gift which is administered by us&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>providing honorable things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And we have sent with them our brother whom we have often proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, because of the great confidence which <i>we have</i> in you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>If <i>anyone inquires</i> about Titus, <i>he is</i> my partner and fellow worker concerning you.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Therefore show to them, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>and before the churches, the proof of your love and of our boasting on your behalf.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-28937a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Corinthians 8:4">2 Corinthians 8:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M omit <i>that we would receive,</i> thus changing text to <i>urgency for the favor and fellowship</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28949b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Corinthians 8:16">2 Corinthians 8:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>has put</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28956c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Corinthians 8:23">2 Corinthians 8:23</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>apostles,</i> &#8220;sent ones&#8221;</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-28957d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Corinthians 8:24">2 Corinthians 8:24</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M omit <i>and</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
