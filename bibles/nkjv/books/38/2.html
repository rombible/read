<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So I said, &#8220;Where are you going?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Zech-2-2">And he said to me, &#8220;To measure Jerusalem, to see what <i>is</i> its width and what <i>is</i> its length.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And there <i>was</i> the angel who talked with me, going out; and another angel was coming out to meet him, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>who said to him, &#8220;Run, speak to this young man, saying: &#8216;Jerusalem shall be inhabited <i>as</i> towns without walls, because of the multitude of men and livestock in it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For I,&#8217; says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, &#8216;will be a wall of fire all around her, and I will be the glory in her midst.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <h3>
