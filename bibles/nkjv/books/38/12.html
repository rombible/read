Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, who stretches out the heavens, lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>drunkenness to all the surrounding peoples, when they lay siege against Judah and Jerusalem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And it shall happen in that day that I will make Jerusalem a very heavy stone for all peoples; all who would heave it away will surely be cut in pieces, though all nations of the earth are gathered against it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>In that day,&#8221; says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, &#8220;I will strike every horse with confusion, and its rider with madness; I will open My eyes on the house of Judah, and will strike every horse of the peoples with blindness. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, &#8216;The inhabitants of Jerusalem <i>are</i> my strength in the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts, their God.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>In that day I will make the governors of Judah like a firepan in the woodpile, and like a fiery torch in the sheaves; they shall devour all the surrounding peoples on the right hand and on the left, but Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place&#8212;Jerusalem.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8220;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will save the tents of Judah first, so that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem shall not become greater than that of Judah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>In that day the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem; the one who is feeble among them in that day shall be like David, and the house of David <i>shall be</i> like God, like the Angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> before them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>It shall be in that day <i>that</i> I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.</span></p> <h3>
Mourning for the Pierced One</span></h3><p><span class="text Zech-12-10"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8220;And I will pour on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem the Spirit of grace and supplication; then they will look on Me whom they pierced. Yes, they will mourn for Him as one mourns for <i>his</i> only <i>son,</i> and grieve for Him as one grieves for a firstborn. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>In that day there shall be a great mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning at Hadad Rimmon in the plain of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Megiddo. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And the land shall mourn, every family by itself: the family of the house of David by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself, and their wives by themselves; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>the family of the house of Levi by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of Shimei by itself, and their wives by themselves; </span>
