<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/17-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>with whom the kings of the earth committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth were made drunk with the wine of her fornication.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/17-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So he carried me away in the Spirit into the wilderness. And I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast <i>which was</i> full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/17-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>The woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the filthiness of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>her fornication. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/17-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And on her forehead a name <i>was</i> written:</span></p><p class="center_top-1"><span class="text Rev-17-5">MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT,<br />THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS<br />AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS<br />OF THE EARTH.</span></p> <p class="first-line-none top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/17-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>I saw the woman, drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. And when I saw her, I marveled with great amazement.</span></p> <h3>
The Meaning of the Woman and the Beast</span></h3><p><span class="text Rev-17-7"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/17-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But the angel said to me, &#8220;Why did you marvel? I will tell you the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>mystery of the woman and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/17-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>The beast that you saw was, and is not, and will ascend out of the bottomless pit and go to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>perdition. And those who dwell on the earth will marvel, whose names are not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world, when they see the beast that was, and is not, and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>yet is.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/17-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;Here <i>is</i> the mind which has wisdom: The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/17-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>There are also seven kings. Five have fallen, one is, <i>and</i> the other has not yet come. And when he comes, he must continue a short time. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/17-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>The beast that was, and is not, is himself also the eighth, and is of the seven, and is going to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>perdition.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/17-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>&#8220;The ten horns which you saw are ten kings who have received no kingdom as yet, but they receive authority for one hour as kings with the beast. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/17-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>These are of one mind, and they will give their power and authority to the beast. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/17-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>These will make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, for He is Lord of lords and King of kings; and those <i>who are</i> with Him <i>are</i> called, chosen, and faithful.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/17-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then he said to me, &#8220;The waters which you saw, where the harlot sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations, and tongues. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/17-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And the ten horns which you <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>saw on the beast, these will hate the harlot, make her desolate and naked, eat her flesh and burn her with fire. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/17-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>For God has put it into their hearts to fulfill His purpose, to be of one mind, and to give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God are fulfilled. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/17-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And the woman whom you saw is that great city which reigns over the kings of the earth.&#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-30977a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Revelation 17:1">Revelation 17:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M omit <i>to me</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30980b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Revelation 17:4">Revelation 17:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'>M <i>the fornication of the earth</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30983c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Revelation 17:7">Revelation 17:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>hidden truth</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30984d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Revelation 17:8">Revelation 17:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>destruction</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30984e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Revelation 17:8">Revelation 17:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M <i>shall be present</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30987f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Revelation 17:11">Revelation 17:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>destruction</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30992g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Revelation 17:16">Revelation 17:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M <i>saw, and the beast</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
