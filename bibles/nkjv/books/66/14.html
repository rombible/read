<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/14-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And I heard a voice from heaven, like the voice of many waters, and like the voice of loud thunder. And I heard the sound of harpists playing their harps. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/14-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>They sang as it were a new song before the throne, before the four living creatures, and the elders; and no one could learn that song except the hundred <i>and</i> forty-four thousand who were redeemed from the earth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/14-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>These are the ones who were not defiled with women, for they are virgins. These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These were <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>redeemed from <i>among</i> men, <i>being</i> firstfruits to God and to the Lamb. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/14-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And in their mouth was found no <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>deceit, for they are without fault <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>before the throne of God.</span></p> <h3>
The Proclamations of Three Angels</span></h3><p><span class="text Rev-14-6"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/14-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth&#8212;to every nation, tribe, tongue, and people&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/14-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>saying with a loud voice, &#8220;Fear God and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment has come; and worship Him who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/14-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And another angel followed, saying, &#8220;Babylon<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span> is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she has made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/14-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, &#8220;If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives <i>his</i> mark on his forehead or on his hand, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/14-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>he himself shall also drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His indignation. He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/14-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; and they have no rest day or night, who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/14-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Here is the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>patience of the saints; here<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span> <i>are</i> those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/14-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then I heard a voice from heaven saying <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>to me, &#8220;Write: &#8216;Blessed <i>are</i> the dead who die in the Lord from now on.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Rev-14-13">&#8220;Yes,&#8221; says the Spirit, &#8220;that they may rest from their labors, and their works follow them.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Reaping the Earth&#8217;s Harvest</span></h3><p><span class="text Rev-14-14"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/14-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and on the cloud sat <i>One</i> like the Son of Man, having on His head a golden crown, and in His hand a sharp sickle. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/14-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to Him who sat on the cloud, &#8220;Thrust in Your sickle and reap, for the time has come <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>for You to reap, for the harvest of the earth is ripe.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/14-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So He who sat on the cloud thrust in His sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped.</span></p> <h3>
Reaping the Grapes of Wrath</span></h3><p><span class="text Rev-14-17"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/14-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/14-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And another angel came out from the altar, who had power over fire, and he cried with a loud cry to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, &#8220;Thrust in your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for her grapes are fully ripe.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/14-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>So the angel thrust his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth, and threw <i>it</i> into the great winepress of the wrath of God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/14-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And the winepress was trampled outside the city, and blood came out of the winepress, up to the horses&#8217; bridles, for one thousand six hundred <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span>furlongs.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-30928a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Revelation 14:1">Revelation 14:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M <i>the</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30928b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Revelation 14:1">Revelation 14:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M add <i>His name and</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30931c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Revelation 14:4">Revelation 14:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'>M adds <i>by Jesus</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30932d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Revelation 14:5">Revelation 14:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M <i>falsehood</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30932e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Revelation 14:5">Revelation 14:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M omit the rest of v. <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Rev.14.5" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=Rev.14.5&amp;version=NKJV">5</span>.</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30935f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Revelation 14:8">Revelation 14:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, which has made;</i> M <i>Babylon the great is fallen.
