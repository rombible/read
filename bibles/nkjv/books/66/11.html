<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>But leave out the court which is outside the temple, and do not measure it, for it has been given to the Gentiles. And they will tread the holy city underfoot <i>for</i> forty-two months. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And I will give <i>power</i> to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy one thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands standing before the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>God of the earth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And if anyone wants to harm them, fire proceeds from their mouth and devours their enemies. And if anyone wants to harm them, he must be killed in this manner. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>These have power to shut heaven, so that no rain falls in the days of their prophecy; and they have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to strike the earth with all plagues, as often as they desire.</span></p> <h3>
The Witnesses Killed</span></h3><p><span class="text Rev-11-7"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>When they finish their testimony, the beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit will make war against them, overcome them, and kill them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And their dead bodies <i>will lie</i> in the street of the great city which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>our Lord was crucified. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then <i>those</i> from the peoples, tribes, tongues, and nations <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>will see their dead bodies three-and-a-half days, and not allow their dead bodies to be put into graves. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And those who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them, make merry, and send gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth.</span></p> <h3>
The Witnesses Resurrected</span></h3><p><span class="text Rev-11-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now after the three-and-a-half days the breath of life from God entered them, and they stood on their feet, and great fear fell on those who saw them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, &#8220;Come up here.&#8221; And they ascended to heaven in a cloud, and their enemies saw them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>In the same hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell. In the earthquake seven thousand people were killed, and the rest were afraid and gave glory to the God of heaven.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/11-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>The second woe is past. Behold, the third woe is coming quickly.</span></p> <h3>
Seventh Trumpet: The Kingdom Proclaimed</span></h3><p><span class="text Rev-11-15"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/11-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then the seventh angel sounded: And there were loud voices in heaven, saying, &#8220;The <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>kingdoms of this world have become <i>the kingdoms</i> of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/11-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And the twenty-four elders who sat before God on their thrones fell on their faces and worshiped God, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/11-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>saying:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Rev-11-17">&#8220;We give You thanks, O Lord God Almighty,</span><br /><span class="text Rev-11-17">The One who is and who was <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>and who is to come,</span><br /><span class="text Rev-11-17">Because You have taken Your great power and reigned.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/11-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>The nations were angry, and Your <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>wrath has come,</span><br /><span class="text Rev-11-18">And the time of the dead, that they should be judged,</span><br /><span class="text Rev-11-18">And that You should reward Your servants the prophets and the saints,</span><br /><span class="text Rev-11-18">And those who fear Your name, small and great,</span><br /><span class="text Rev-11-18">And should destroy those who destroy the earth.&#8221;</span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/11-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then the temple of God was opened in heaven, and the ark of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>His covenant was seen in His temple.
