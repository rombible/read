And I saw a beast rising up out of the sea, having <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads a blasphemous name. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Now the beast which I saw was like a leopard, his feet were like <i>the feet of</i> a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. The dragon gave him his power, his throne, and great authority. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And I saw one of his heads as if it had been mortally wounded, and his deadly wound was healed. And all the world marveled and followed the beast. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So they worshiped the dragon who gave authority to the beast; and they worshiped the beast, saying, &#8220;Who <i>is</i> like the beast? Who is able to make war with him?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And he was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and he was given authority to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>continue for forty-two months. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/13-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, His tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/13-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>It was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And authority was given him over every <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>tribe, tongue, and nation. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>All who dwell on the earth will worship him, whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/13-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>If anyone has an ear, let him hear. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/13-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>He who leads into captivity shall go into captivity; he who kills with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>patience and the faith of the saints.</span></p> <h3>
The Beast from the Earth</span></h3><p><span class="text Rev-13-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb and spoke like a dragon. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/13-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence, and causes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/13-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>He performs great signs, so that he even makes fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/13-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And he deceives <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>those who dwell on the earth by those signs which he was granted to do in the sight of the beast, telling those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast who was wounded by the sword and lived. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/13-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>He was granted <i>power</i> to give breath to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak and cause as many as would not worship the image of the beast to be killed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/13-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>He causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/13-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>and that no one may buy or sell except one who has <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/13-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Here is wisdom.
