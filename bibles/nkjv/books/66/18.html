<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/18-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he cried <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>mightily with a loud voice, saying, &#8220;Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and has become a dwelling place of demons, a prison for every foul spirit, and a cage for every unclean and hated bird! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/18-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth have become rich through the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>abundance of her luxury.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/18-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And I heard another voice from heaven saying, &#8220;Come out of her, my people, lest you share in her sins, and lest you receive of her plagues. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/18-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For her sins <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>have reached to heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/18-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Render to her just as she rendered <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>to you, and repay her double according to her works; in the cup which she has mixed, mix double for her. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/18-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>In the measure that she glorified herself and lived <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>luxuriously, in the same measure give her torment and sorrow; for she says in her heart, &#8216;I sit <i>as</i> queen, and am no widow, and will not see sorrow.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/18-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Therefore her plagues will come in one day&#8212;death and mourning and famine. And she will be utterly burned with fire, for strong <i>is</i> the Lord God who <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>judges her.</span></p> <h3>
The World Mourns Babylon&#8217;s Fall</span></h3><p><span class="text Rev-18-9"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/18-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;The kings of the earth who committed fornication and lived luxuriously with her will weep and lament for her, when they see the smoke of her burning, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/18-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>standing at a distance for fear of her torment, saying, &#8216;Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city! For in one hour your judgment has come.&#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/18-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8220;And the merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her, for no one buys their merchandise anymore: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/18-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>merchandise of gold and silver, precious stones and pearls, fine linen and purple, silk and scarlet, every kind of citron wood, every kind of object of ivory, every kind of object of most precious wood, bronze, iron, and marble; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/18-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>and cinnamon and incense, fragrant oil and frankincense, wine and oil, fine flour and wheat, cattle and sheep, horses and chariots, and bodies and souls of men. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/18-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>The fruit that your soul longed for has gone from you, and all the things which are rich and splendid have <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>gone from you, and you shall find them no more at all. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/18-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>The merchants of these things, who became rich by her, will stand at a distance for fear of her torment, weeping and wailing, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/18-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>and saying, &#8216;Alas, alas, that great city that was clothed in fine linen, purple, and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/18-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>For in one hour such great riches <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>came to nothing.&#8217; Every shipmaster, all who travel by ship, sailors, and as many as trade on the sea, stood at a distance </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/18-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>and cried out when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, &#8216;What <i>is</i> like this great city?&#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/18-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>&#8220;They threw dust on their heads and cried out, weeping and wailing, and saying, &#8216;Alas, alas, that great city, in which all who had ships on the sea became rich by her wealth! For in one hour she <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>is made desolate.&#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/18-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>&#8220;Rejoice over her, O heaven, and <i>you</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>holy apostles and prophets, for God has avenged you on her!&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Finality of Babylon&#8217;s Fall</span></h3><p><span class="text Rev-18-21"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/18-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw <i>it</i> into the sea, saying, &#8220;Thus with violence the great city Babylon shall be thrown down, and shall not be found anymore. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/18-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>The sound of harpists, musicians, flutists, and trumpeters shall not be heard in you anymore.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/18-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>The light of a lamp shall not shine in you anymore, and the voice of bridegroom and bride shall not be heard in you anymore.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/18-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And in her was found the blood of prophets and saints, and of all who were slain on the earth.&#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-30996a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Revelation 18:2">Revelation 18:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M omit <i>mightily</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30997b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Revelation 18:3">Revelation 18:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>strengths</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30999c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Revelation 18:5">Revelation 18:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M <i>have been heaped up</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-31000d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Revelation 18:6">Revelation 18:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M omit <i>to you</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-31001e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Revelation 18:7">Revelation 18:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>sensually</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-31002f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Revelation 18:8">Revelation 18:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M <i>has judged</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-31008g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Revelation 18:14">Revelation 18:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M <i>been lost to you</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-31011h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Revelation 18:17">Revelation 18:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>have been laid waste</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-31013i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Revelation 18:19">Revelation 18:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>have been laid waste</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-31014j"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Revelation 18:20">Revelation 18:20</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M <i>saints and apostles</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
