<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And I looked, and behold, a white horse. He who sat on it had a bow; and a crown was given to him, and he went out conquering and to conquer.</span></p> <h3>
Second Seal: Conflict on Earth</span></h3><p><span class="text Rev-6-3"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>When He opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, &#8220;Come <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>and see.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/6-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Another horse, fiery red, went out. And it was granted to the one who sat on it to take peace from the earth, and that <i>people</i> should kill one another; and there was given to him a great sword.</span></p> <h3>
Third Seal: Scarcity on Earth</span></h3><p><span class="text Rev-6-5"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/6-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>When He opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, &#8220;Come and see.&#8221; So I looked, and behold, a black horse, and he who sat on it had a pair of scales<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> in his hand. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, &#8220;A <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>quart of wheat for a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius; and do not harm the oil and the wine.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Fourth Seal: Widespread Death on Earth</span></h3><p><span class="text Rev-6-7"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>When He opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, &#8220;Come and see.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So I looked, and behold, a pale horse. And the name of him who sat on it was Death, and Hades followed with him. And <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>power was given to them over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword, with hunger, with death, and by the beasts of the earth.</span></p> <h3>
Fifth Seal: The Cry of the Martyrs</span></h3><p><span class="text Rev-6-9"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>When He opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/6-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And they cried with a loud voice, saying, &#8220;How long, O Lord, holy and true, until You judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/6-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then a white robe was given to each of them; and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, until both <i>the number of</i> their fellow servants and their brethren, who would be killed as they <i>were,</i> was completed.</span></p> <h3>
Sixth Seal: Cosmic Disturbances</span></h3><p><span class="text Rev-6-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/6-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>I looked when He opened the sixth seal, and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>behold, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>moon became like blood. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/6-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And the stars of heaven fell to the earth, as a fig tree drops its late figs when it is shaken by a mighty wind. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/6-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then the sky <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>receded as a scroll when it is rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved out of its place. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/6-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And the kings of the earth, the great men, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>the rich men, the commanders, the mighty men, every slave and every free man, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/6-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>and said to the mountains and rocks, &#8220;Fall on us and hide us from the face of Him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb! </span>
