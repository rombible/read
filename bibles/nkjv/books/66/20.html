<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/20-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>He laid hold of the dragon, that serpent of old, who is <i>the</i> Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/20-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and he cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal on him, so that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years were finished. But after these things he must be released for a little while.</span></p> <h3>
The Saints Reign with Christ 1,000 Years</span></h3><p><span class="text Rev-20-4"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/20-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was committed to them. Then <i>I saw</i> the souls of those who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of God, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received <i>his</i> mark on their foreheads or on their hands. And they lived and reigned with Christ for <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>a thousand years. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/20-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But the rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were finished. This <i>is</i> the first resurrection. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/20-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Blessed and holy <i>is</i> he who has part in the first resurrection. Over such the second death has no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with Him a thousand years.</span></p> <h3>
Satanic Rebellion Crushed</span></h3><p><span class="text Rev-20-7"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/20-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now when the thousand years have expired, Satan will be released from his prison </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/20-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>and will go out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle, whose number <i>is</i> as the sand of the sea. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/20-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>They went up on the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city. And fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/20-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>The devil, who deceived them, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span> the beast and the false prophet <i>are.</i> And they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.</span></p> <h3>
The Great White Throne Judgment</span></h3><p><span class="text Rev-20-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/20-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/20-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>God, and books were opened.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/20-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>The sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Hades delivered up the dead who were in them. And they were judged, each one according to his works. </span>
