<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, &#8220;Who is worthy to open the scroll and to loose its seals?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And no one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll, or to look at it.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>and read the scroll, or to look at it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But one of the elders said to me, &#8220;Do not weep. Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has prevailed to open the scroll and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>to loose its seven seals.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And I looked, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>and behold, in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as though it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent out into all the earth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then He came and took the scroll out of the right hand of Him who sat on the throne.</span></p> <h3>
Worthy Is the Lamb</span></h3><p><span class="text Rev-5-8"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Now when He had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each having a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And they sang a new song, saying:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Rev-5-9">&#8220;You are worthy to take the scroll,</span><br /><span class="text Rev-5-9">And to open its seals;</span><br /><span class="text Rev-5-9">For You were slain,</span><br /><span class="text Rev-5-9">And have redeemed us to God by Your blood</span><br /><span class="text Rev-5-9">Out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation,</span><br />
