First Bowl: Loathsome Sores</span></h3><p><span class="text Rev-16-2"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/16-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So the first went and poured out his bowl upon the earth, and a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>foul and loathsome sore came upon the men who had the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image.</span></p> <h3>
Second Bowl: The Sea Turns to Blood</span></h3><p><span class="text Rev-16-3"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/16-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then the second angel poured out his bowl on the sea, and it became blood as of a dead <i>man;</i> and every living creature in the sea died.</span></p> <h3>
Third Bowl: The Waters Turn to Blood</span></h3><p><span class="text Rev-16-4"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/16-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then the third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and springs of water, and they became blood. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/16-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And I heard the angel of the waters saying:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Rev-16-5">&#8220;You are righteous, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>O Lord,</span><br /><span class="text Rev-16-5">The One who is and who <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>was and who is to be,</span><br /><span class="text Rev-16-5">Because You have judged these things.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/16-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets,</span><br /><span class="text Rev-16-6">And You have given them blood to drink.</span><br /><span class="text Rev-16-6"><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>For it is their just due.&#8221;</span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/16-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And I heard <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>another from the altar saying, &#8220;Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous <i>are</i> Your judgments.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Fourth Bowl: Men Are Scorched</span></h3><p><span class="text Rev-16-8"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/16-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then the fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and power was given to him to scorch men with fire. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/16-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And men were scorched with great heat, and they blasphemed the name of God who has power over these plagues; and they did not repent and give Him glory.</span></p> <h3>
Fifth Bowl: Darkness and Pain</span></h3><p><span class="text Rev-16-10"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/16-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then the fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and his kingdom became full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues because of the pain. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/16-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>They blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and did not repent of their deeds.</span></p> <h3>
Sixth Bowl: Euphrates Dried Up</span></h3><p><span class="text Rev-16-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/16-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then the sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up, so that the way of the kings from the east might be prepared. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/16-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs <i>coming</i> out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/16-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For they are spirits of demons, performing signs, <i>which</i> go out to the kings <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/16-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;Behold, I am coming as a thief.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/16-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And they gathered them together to the place called in Hebrew, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>Armageddon.</span></p> <h3>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/16-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And there were noises and thunderings and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such a mighty and great earthquake as had not occurred since men were on the earth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/16-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Now the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. And great Babylon was remembered before God, to give her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of His wrath. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/16-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then every island fled away, and the mountains were not found. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/16-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And great hail from heaven fell upon men, <i>each hailstone</i> about the weight of a talent.
