To him was given the key to the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>bottomless pit. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And he opened the bottomless pit, and smoke arose out of the pit like the smoke of a great furnace. So the sun and the air were darkened because of the smoke of the pit. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then out of the smoke locusts came upon the earth. And to them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>They were commanded not to harm the grass of the earth, or any green thing, or any tree, but only those men who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>they were not given <i>authority</i> to kill them, but to torment them <i>for</i> five months. Their torment <i>was</i> like the torment of a scorpion when it strikes a man. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>In those days men will seek death and will not find it; they will desire to die, and death will flee from them.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>The shape of the locusts was like horses prepared for battle. On their heads were crowns of something like gold, and their faces <i>were</i> like the faces of men. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>They had hair like women&#8217;s hair, and their teeth were like lions&#8217; <i>teeth.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And they had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings <i>was</i> like the sound of chariots with many horses running into battle. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>They had tails like scorpions, and there were stings in their tails. Their power <i>was</i> to hurt men five months. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And they had as king over them the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in Hebrew <i>is</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Abaddon, but in Greek he has the name <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>Apollyon.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>One woe is past. Behold, still two more woes are coming after these things.</span></p> <h3>
Sixth Trumpet: The Angels from the Euphrates</span></h3><p><span class="text Rev-9-13"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then the sixth angel sounded: And I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/9-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, &#8220;Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So the four angels, who had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, were released to kill a third of mankind. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/9-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Now the number of the army of the horsemen <i>was</i> two hundred million; I heard the number of them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/9-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And thus I saw the horses in the vision: those who sat on them had breastplates of fiery red, hyacinth blue, and sulfur yellow; and the heads of the horses <i>were</i> like the heads of lions; and out of their mouths came fire, smoke, and brimstone. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/9-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>By these three <i>plagues</i> a third of mankind was killed&#8212;by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone which came out of their mouths. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/9-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>For <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>their power is in their mouth and in their tails; for their tails <i>are</i> like serpents, having heads; and with them they do harm.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/9-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>But the rest of mankind, who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands, that they should not worship demons, and idols of gold, silver, brass, stone, and wood, which can neither see nor hear nor walk. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/9-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And they did not repent of their murders or their <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>sorceries or their sexual immorality or their thefts.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-30842a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Revelation 9:1">Revelation 9:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>shaft of the abyss</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30846b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Revelation 9:5">Revelation 9:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'>The locusts</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30852c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Revelation 9:11">Revelation 9:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Destruction</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30852d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Revelation 9:11">Revelation 9:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Destroyer</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30860e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Revelation 9:19">Revelation 9:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M <i>the power of the horses</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30862f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Revelation 9:21">Revelation 9:21</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M <i>drugs</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
