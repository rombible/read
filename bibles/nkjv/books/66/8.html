<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and to them were given seven trumpets. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then another angel, having a golden censer, came and stood at the altar. He was given much incense, that he should offer <i>it</i> with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, ascended before God from the angel&#8217;s hand. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then the angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and threw <i>it</i> to the earth. And there were noises, thunderings, lightnings, and an earthquake.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.</span></p> <h3>
First Trumpet: Vegetation Struck</span></h3><p><span class="text Rev-8-7"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>The first angel sounded: And hail and fire followed, mingled with blood, and they were thrown to the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>earth. And a third of the trees were burned up, and all green grass was burned up.</span></p> <h3>
Second Trumpet: The Seas Struck</span></h3><p><span class="text Rev-8-8"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then the second angel sounded: And <i>something</i> like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea, and a third of the sea became blood. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.</span></p> <h3>
Third Trumpet: The Waters Struck</span></h3><p><span class="text Rev-8-10"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then the third angel sounded: And a great star fell from heaven, burning like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>The name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters became wormwood, and many men died from the water, because it was made bitter.</span></p> <h3>
Fourth Trumpet: The Heavens Struck</span></h3><p><span class="text Rev-8-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/8-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then the fourth angel sounded: And a third of the sun was struck, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of them were darkened. A third of the day <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>did not shine, and likewise the night.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/8-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And I looked, and I heard an <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, &#8220;Woe, woe, woe to the inhabitants of the earth, because of the remaining blasts of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to sound!&#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-30835a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Revelation 8:7">Revelation 8:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M add <i>and a third of the earth was burned up</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30840b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Revelation 8:12">Revelation 8:12</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>had no light</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-30841c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Revelation 8:13">Revelation 8:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M <i>eagle</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
