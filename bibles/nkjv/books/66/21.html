Also there was no more sea. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then I, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying, &#8220;Behold, the tabernacle of God <i>is</i> with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. God Himself will be with them <i>and be</i> their God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then He who sat on the throne said, &#8220;Behold, I make all things new.&#8221; And He said <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>to me, &#8220;Write, for these words are true and faithful.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And He said to me, &#8220;It<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely to him who thirsts. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>He who overcomes <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>shall inherit all things, and I will be his God and he shall be My son. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But the cowardly, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>unbelieving, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
The New Jerusalem</span></h3><p><span class="text Rev-21-9"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls filled with the seven last plagues came <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>to me and talked with me, saying, &#8220;Come, I will show you the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>bride, the Lamb&#8217;s wife.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>great city, the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>having the glory of God. Her light <i>was</i> like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone, clear as crystal. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Also she had a great and high wall with twelve gates, and twelve angels at the gates, and names written on them, which are <i>the names</i> of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Now the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And he who talked with me had a gold reed to measure the city, its gates, and its wall. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>The city is laid out as a square; its length is as great as its breadth. And he measured the city with the reed: twelve thousand <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span>furlongs. Its length, breadth, and height are equal. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then he measured its wall: one hundred <i>and</i> forty-four cubits, <i>according</i> to the measure of a man, that is, of an angel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>The construction of its wall was <i>of</i> jasper; and the city <i>was</i> pure gold, like clear glass. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>The foundations of the wall of the city <i>were</i> adorned with all kinds of precious stones: the first foundation <i>was</i> jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>the fifth sardonyx, the sixth sardius, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>The twelve gates <i>were</i> twelve pearls: each individual gate was of one pearl. And the street of the city <i>was</i> pure gold, like transparent glass.</span></p> <h3>
The Glory of the New Jerusalem</span></h3><p><span class="text Rev-21-22"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>The city had no need of the sun or of the moon to shine <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[l]</a></span>in it, for the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[m]</a></span>glory of God illuminated it. The Lamb <i>is</i> its light. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And the nations <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[n]</a></span>of those who are saved shall walk in its light, and the kings of the earth bring their glory and honor <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[o]</a></span>into it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Its gates shall not be shut at all by day (there shall be no night there). </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And they shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations into <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[p]</a></span>it. </span>
