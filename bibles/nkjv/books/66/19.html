Salvation and glory and honor and power <i>belong</i> to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>the Lord our God! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/19-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>For true and righteous <i>are</i> His judgments, because He has judged the great harlot who corrupted the earth with her fornication; and He has avenged on her the blood of His servants <i>shed</i> by her.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/19-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Again they said, &#8220;Alleluia! Her smoke rises up forever and ever!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/19-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who sat on the throne, saying, &#8220;Amen! Alleluia!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/19-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then a voice came from the throne, saying, &#8220;Praise our God, all you His servants and those who fear Him, both<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> small and great!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/19-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And I heard, as it were, the voice of a great multitude, as the sound of many waters and as the sound of mighty thunderings, saying, &#8220;Alleluia! For the<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span> Lord God Omnipotent reigns! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/19-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Let us be glad and rejoice and give Him glory, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/19-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And to her it was granted to be arrayed in fine linen, clean and bright, for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/19-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then he said to me, &#8220;Write: &#8216;Blessed <i>are</i> those who are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb!&#8217; &#8221; And he said to me, &#8220;These are the true sayings of God.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/19-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And I fell at his feet to worship him. But he said to me, &#8220;See <i>that you do</i> not <i>do that!</i> I am your fellow servant, and of your brethren who have the testimony of Jesus. Worship God! For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Christ on a White Horse</span></h3><p><span class="text Rev-19-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/19-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse. And He who sat on him <i>was</i> called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/19-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>His eyes <i>were</i> like a flame of fire, and on His head <i>were</i> many crowns. He <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>had a name written that no one knew except Himself. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/19-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>He <i>was</i> clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word of God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/19-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And the armies in heaven, clothed in <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>fine linen, white and clean, followed Him on white horses. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/19-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Now out of His mouth goes a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>sharp sword, that with it He should strike the nations. And He Himself will rule them with a rod of iron. He Himself treads the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/19-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And He has on <i>His</i> robe and on His thigh a name written:</span></p><p class="center_top-1"><span class="text Rev-19-16">KING OF KINGS AND<br />LORD OF LORDS.</span></p> <h3>
The Beast and His Armies Defeated</span></h3><p><span class="text Rev-19-17"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/19-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in the midst of heaven, &#8220;Come and gather together for the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>supper of the great God, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/19-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>that you may eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains, the flesh of mighty men, the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them, and the flesh of all <i>people,</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>free and slave, both small and great.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/19-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And I saw the beast, the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against Him who sat on the horse and against His army. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/19-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then the beast was captured, and with him the false prophet who worked signs in his presence, by which he deceived those who received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image. These two were cast alive into the lake of fire burning with brimstone. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/19-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And the rest were killed with the sword which proceeded from the mouth of Him who sat on the horse. And all the birds were filled with their flesh.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-31019a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Revelation 19:1">Revelation 19:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M add <i>something like</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-31019b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Revelation 19:1">Revelation 19:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M omit <i>the Lord</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-31023c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Revelation 19:5">Revelation 19:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M omit <i>both</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-31024d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Revelation 19:6">Revelation 19:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M <i>our</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-31030e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Revelation 19:12">Revelation 19:12</span> <span class='footnote-text'>M adds <i>names written, and</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-31032f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Revelation 19:14">Revelation 19:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M <i>pure white linen</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-31033g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Revelation 19:15">Revelation 19:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'>M <i>sharp two-edged</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-31035h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Revelation 19:17">Revelation 19:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M <i>great supper of God</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-31036i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Revelation 19:18">Revelation 19:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M <i>both free</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
