<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then He spoke many things to them in parables, saying: <span class="woj">&#8220;Behold, a sower went out to sow.</span> </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>He answered and said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Because</span> <span class="woj">it has been given to you to know the</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span><span class="woj">mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given.</span> </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span><span class="woj">Therefore I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.</span> </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span><span class="woj">When anyone hears the word</span> <span class="woj">of the kingdom, and does not understand <i>it,</i> then the wicked <i>one</i> comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span><span class="woj">But he who received the seed on stony places, this is he who hears the word and immediately</span> <span class="woj">receives it with joy;</span> </span>
