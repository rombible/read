<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and said to his servants, &#8220;This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead, and therefore these powers are at work in him.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For Herod had laid hold of John and bound him, and put <i>him</i> in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip&#8217;s wife. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Because John had said to him, &#8220;It is not lawful for you to have her.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And although he wanted to put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But when Herod&#8217;s birthday was celebrated, the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Therefore he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So she, having been prompted by her mother, said, &#8220;Give me John the Baptist&#8217;s head here on a platter.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And the king was sorry; nevertheless, because of the oaths and because of those who sat with him, he commanded <i>it</i> to be given to <i>her.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So he sent and had John beheaded in prison. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought <i>it</i> to her mother. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then his disciples came and took away the body and buried it, and went and told Jesus.</span></p> <h3>
Feeding the Five Thousand</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-14-13"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>When Jesus heard <i>it,</i> He departed from there by boat to a deserted place by Himself. But when the multitudes heard it, they followed Him on foot from the cities. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And when Jesus went out He saw a great multitude; and He was moved with compassion for them, and healed their sick. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>When it was evening, His disciples came to Him, saying, &#8220;This is a deserted place, and the hour is already late. Send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages and buy themselves food.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But Jesus said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And they said to Him, &#8220;We have here only five loaves and two fish.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>He said, <span class="woj">&#8220;Bring them here to Me.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then He commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass. And He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He blessed and broke and gave the loaves to the disciples; and the disciples gave to the multitudes. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So they all ate and were filled, and they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments that remained. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Now those who had eaten were about five thousand men, besides women and children.</span></p> <h3>
Jesus Walks on the Sea</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-14-22"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Immediately Jesus <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>made His disciples get into the boat and go before Him to the other side, while He sent the multitudes away. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And when He had sent the multitudes away, He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray. Now when evening came, He was alone there. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>But the boat was now <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>in the middle of the sea, tossed by the waves, for the wind was contrary.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Now in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And when the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, &#8220;It is a ghost!&#8221; And they cried out for fear.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;Be of good</span> <span class="woj">cheer!</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span><span class="woj">It is I; do not be afraid.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And Peter answered Him and said, &#8220;Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>So He said, <span class="woj">&#8220;Come.&#8221;</span> And when Peter had come down out of the boat, he walked on the water to go to Jesus. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>But when he saw <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>that the wind <i>was</i> boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink he cried out, saying, &#8220;Lord, save me!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>And immediately Jesus stretched out <i>His</i> hand and caught him, and said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;O you of</span> <span class="woj">little faith, why did you doubt?&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Then those who were in the boat <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>came and worshiped Him, saying, &#8220;Truly You are the Son of God.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Many Touch Him and Are Made Well</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-14-34"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>When they had crossed over, they came <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>to the land of Gennesaret. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>And when the men of that place recognized Him, they sent out into all that surrounding region, brought to Him all who were sick, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>and begged Him that they might only touch the hem of His garment. And as many as touched <i>it</i> were made perfectly well.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-23620a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Matthew 14:22">Matthew 14:22</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>invited, strongly urged</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-23622b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Matthew 14:24">Matthew 14:24</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>many furlongs away from the land</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-23625c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Matthew 14:27">Matthew 14:27</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Take courage</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-23625d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Matthew 14:27">Matthew 14:27</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>I am</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-23628e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Matthew 14:30">Matthew 14:30</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU brackets <i>that</i> and <i>boisterous</i> as disputed.</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-23631f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Matthew 14:33">Matthew 14:33</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>came and</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-23632g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Matthew 14:34">Matthew 14:34</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>to land at</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
