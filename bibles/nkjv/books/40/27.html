<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And when they had bound Him, they led Him away and delivered Him to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>Pontius Pilate the governor.</span></p> <h3>
Judas Hangs Himself</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-27-3"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then Judas, His betrayer, seeing that He had been condemned, was remorseful and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>saying, &#8220;I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Matt-27-4">And they said, &#8220;What <i>is that</i> to us? You see <i>to it!</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed, and went and hanged himself.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, &#8220;It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the price of blood.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And they consulted together and bought with them the potter&#8217;s field, to bury strangers in. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then was fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, <span class="oblique">&#8220;And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the value of Him who was priced,</span> whom they of the children of Israel priced, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><span class="oblique">and</span> <span class="oblique">gave them for the potter&#8217;s field, as the</span> <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <span class="oblique">directed me.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Jesus Faces Pilate</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-27-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now Jesus stood before the governor. And the governor asked Him, saying, &#8220;Are You the King of the Jews?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Matt-27-11">Jesus said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;<i>It is as</i> you say.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And while He was being accused by the chief priests and elders, He answered nothing.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then Pilate said to Him, &#8220;Do You not hear how many things they testify against You?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But He answered him not one word, so that the governor marveled greatly.</span></p> <h3>
Taking the Place of Barabbas</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-27-15"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to releasing to the multitude one prisoner whom they wished. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And at that time they had a notorious prisoner called <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>Barabbas. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Therefore, when they had gathered together, Pilate said to them, &#8220;Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>For he knew that they had handed Him over because of envy.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, &#8220;Have nothing to do with that just Man, for I have suffered many things today in a dream because of Him.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitudes that they should ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>The governor answered and said to them, &#8220;Which of the two do you want me to release to you?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Matt-27-21">They said, &#8220;Barabbas!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Pilate said to them, &#8220;What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Matt-27-22"><i>They</i> all said to him, &#8220;Let Him be crucified!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Then the governor said, &#8220;Why, what evil has He done?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Matt-27-23">But they cried out all the more, saying, &#8220;Let Him be crucified!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>When Pilate saw that he could not prevail at all, but rather <i>that</i> a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>tumult was rising, he took water and washed <i>his</i> hands before the multitude, saying, &#8220;I am innocent of the blood of this <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>just Person. You see <i>to it.</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And all the people answered and said, &#8220;His blood <i>be</i> on us and on our children.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Then he released Barabbas to them; and when he had <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>scourged Jesus, he delivered <i>Him</i> to be crucified.</span></p> <h3>
The Soldiers Mock Jesus</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-27-27"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>Praetorium and gathered the whole <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>garrison around Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And they stripped Him and put a scarlet robe on Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>When they had <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>twisted a crown of thorns, they put <i>it</i> on His head, and a reed in His right hand. And they bowed the knee before Him and mocked Him, saying, &#8220;Hail, King of the Jews!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Then they spat on Him, and took the reed and struck Him on the head. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>And when they had mocked Him, they took the robe off Him, put His <i>own</i> clothes on Him, and led Him away to be crucified.</span></p> <h3>
The King on a Cross</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-27-32"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Now as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name. Him they compelled to bear His cross. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And when they had come to a place called Golgotha, that is to say, Place of a Skull, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>they gave Him <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>sour wine mingled with gall to drink. But when He had tasted <i>it,</i> He would not drink.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Then they crucified Him, and divided His garments, casting lots, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Matt-27-35"><span class="oblique">&#8220;They divided My garments among them,</span></span><br /><span class="text Matt-27-35"><span class="oblique">And for My clothing they cast lots.&#8221;</span></span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Sitting down, they kept watch over Him there. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>And they put up over His head the accusation written against Him:</span></p><p class="center_top-1"><span class="text Matt-27-37">THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span></p> <p class="first-line-none top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>Then two robbers were crucified with Him, one on the right and another on the left.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>And those who passed by blasphemed Him, wagging their heads </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>and saying, &#8220;You who destroy the temple and build <i>it</i> in three days, save Yourself! If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>Likewise the chief priests also, mocking with the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span>scribes and elders, said, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>&#8220;He saved others; Himself He cannot save. <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[l]</a></span>If He is the King of Israel, let Him now come down from the cross, and we will believe <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[m]</a></span>Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>He trusted in God; let Him deliver Him now if He will have Him; for He said, &#8216;I am the Son of God.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>Even the robbers who were crucified with Him reviled Him with the same thing.</span></p> <h3>
Jesus Dies on the Cross</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-27-45"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>Now from the sixth hour until the ninth hour there was darkness over all the land. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span>And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, <span class="woj">&#8220;Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?&#8221; that is,</span> <span class="woj">&#8220;My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-47.htm"><b>47</b></a></span>Some of those who stood there, when they heard <i>that,</i> said, &#8220;This Man is calling for Elijah!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-48.htm"><b>48</b></a></span>Immediately one of them ran and took a sponge, filled <i>it</i> with sour wine and put <i>it</i> on a reed, and offered it to Him to drink.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-49.htm"><b>49</b></a></span>The rest said, &#8220;Let Him alone; let us see if Elijah will come to save Him.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-50.htm"><b>50</b></a></span>And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and yielded up His spirit.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-51.htm"><b>51</b></a></span>Then, behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom; and the earth quaked, and the rocks were split, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-52.htm"><b>52</b></a></span>and the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-53.htm"><b>53</b></a></span>and coming out of the graves after His resurrection, they went into the holy city and appeared to many.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-54.htm"><b>54</b></a></span>So when the centurion and those with him, who were guarding Jesus, saw the earthquake and the things that had happened, they feared greatly, saying, &#8220;Truly this was the Son of God!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-55.htm"><b>55</b></a></span>And many women who followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to Him, were there looking on from afar, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-56.htm"><b>56</b></a></span>among whom were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[n]</a></span>Joses, and the mother of Zebedee&#8217;s sons.</span></p> <h3>
Jesus Buried in Joseph&#8217;s Tomb</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-27-57"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-57.htm"><b>57</b></a></span>Now when evening had come, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who himself had also become a disciple of Jesus. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-58.htm"><b>58</b></a></span>This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given to him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-59.htm"><b>59</b></a></span>When Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-60.htm"><b>60</b></a></span>and laid it in his new tomb which he had hewn out of the rock; and he rolled a large stone against the door of the tomb, and departed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-61.htm"><b>61</b></a></span>And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[o]</a></span>opposite the tomb.</span></p> <h3>
Pilate Sets a Guard</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-27-62"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-62.htm"><b>62</b></a></span>On the next day, which followed the Day of Preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees gathered together to Pilate, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-63.htm"><b>63</b></a></span>saying, &#8220;Sir, we remember, while He was still alive, how that deceiver said, <span class="woj">&#8216;After three days I will rise.&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-64.htm"><b>64</b></a></span>Therefore command that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest His disciples come <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[p]</a></span>by night and steal Him <i>away,</i> and say to the people, &#8216;He has risen from the dead.&#8217; So the last deception will be worse than the first.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-65.htm"><b>65</b></a></span>Pilate said to them, &#8220;You have a guard; go your way, make <i>it</i> as secure as you know how.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-66.htm"><b>66</b></a></span>So they went and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone and setting the guard.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-24132a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Matthew 27:2">Matthew 27:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>Pontius</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24146b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Matthew 27:16">Matthew 27:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>Jesus Barabbas</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24154c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Matthew 27:24">Matthew 27:24</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>an uproar</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24154d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Matthew 27:24">Matthew 27:24</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>just</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24156e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Matthew 27:26">Matthew 27:26</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>flogged</i> with a Roman scourge</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24157f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Matthew 27:27">Matthew 27:27</span> <span class='footnote-text'>The governor&#8217;s headquarters</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24157g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Matthew 27:27">Matthew 27:27</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>cohort</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24159h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Matthew 27:29">Matthew 27:29</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>woven</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24164i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Matthew 27:34">Matthew 27:34</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>sour</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24165j"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Matthew 27:35">Matthew 27:35</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M omit the rest of v. <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Matt.27.35" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=Matt.27.35&amp;version=NKJV">35</span>.</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24171k"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Matthew 27:41">Matthew 27:41</span> <span class='footnote-text'>M <i>scribes, the Pharisees, and the elders</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24172l"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Matthew 27:42">Matthew 27:42</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>If</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24172m"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Matthew 27:42">Matthew 27:42</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M <i>in Him</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24186n"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Matthew 27:56">Matthew 27:56</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>Joseph</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24191o"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Matthew 27:61">Matthew 27:61</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>in front of</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-24194p"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Matthew 27:64">Matthew 27:64</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>by night</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
