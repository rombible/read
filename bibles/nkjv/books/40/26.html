<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/26-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For this fragrant oil might have been sold for much and given to <i>the</i> poor.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/26-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>But when Jesus was aware of <i>it,</i> He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Why do you trouble the woman? For she has done a good work for Me.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/26-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span><span class="woj">For you have the poor with you always, but</span> <span class="woj">Me you do not have always.</span> </span>

Judas Agrees to Betray Jesus</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-26-14"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/26-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/26-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and said, &#8220;What are you willing to give me if I deliver Him to you?&#8221; And they counted out to him thirty pieces of silver. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/26-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So from that time he sought opportunity to betray Him.</span></p> <h3>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/26-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And they were exceedingly sorrowful, and each of them began to say to Him, &#8220;Lord, is it I?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/26-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>He answered and said, <span class="woj">&#8220;He who dipped <i>his</i> hand with Me in the dish will betray Me.</span> </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/26-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then Judas, who was betraying Him, answered and said, &#8220;Rabbi, is it I?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Matt-26-25">He said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;You have said it.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/26-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Then He took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave <i>it</i> to them, saying, <span class="woj">&#8220;Drink from it, all of you.</span> </span>

The Prayer in the Garden</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-26-36"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/26-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to the disciples, <span class="woj">&#8220;Sit here while I go and pray over there.&#8221;</span> </span>
