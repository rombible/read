<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>saying, &#8220;Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we have seen His star in the East and have come to worship Him.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>When Herod the king heard <i>this,</i> he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So they said to him, &#8220;In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the prophet:</span></p> <div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span><span class="oblique">&#8216;But</span> <span class="oblique">you, Bethlehem,</span> <i>in</i> <span class="oblique">the land of Judah,</span></span><br /><span class="text Matt-2-6"><span class="oblique">Are not the least among the rulers of Judah;</span></span><br /><span class="text Matt-2-6"><span class="oblique">For out of you shall come a Ruler</span></span><br /><span class="text Matt-2-6"><span class="oblique">Who will shepherd My people Israel.&#8217;</span> &#8221;</span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then Herod, when he had secretly called the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>wise men, determined from them what time the star appeared. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And he sent them to Bethlehem and said, &#8220;Go and search carefully for the young Child, and when you have found <i>Him,</i> bring back word to me, that I may come and worship Him also.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>When they heard the king, they departed; and behold, the star which they had seen in the East went before them, till it came and stood over where the young Child was. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And when they had come into the house, they saw the young Child with Mary His mother, and fell down and worshiped Him. And when they had opened their treasures, they presented gifts to Him: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then, being divinely warned in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed for their own country another way.</span></p> <h3>
The Flight into Egypt</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-2-13"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, &#8220;Arise, take the young Child and His mother, flee to Egypt, and stay there until I bring you word; for Herod will seek the young Child to destroy Him.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>When he arose, he took the young Child and His mother by night and departed for Egypt, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and was there until the death of Herod, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, <span class="oblique">&#8220;Out of Egypt I called My Son.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Massacre of the Innocents</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-2-16"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then Herod, when he saw that he was deceived by the wise men, was exceedingly angry; and he sent forth and put to death all the male children who were in Bethlehem and in all its districts, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had determined from the wise men. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then was fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying:</span></p> <div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span><span class="oblique">&#8220;A</span> <span class="oblique">voice was heard in Ramah,</span></span><br /><span class="text Matt-2-18"><span class="oblique">Lamentation, weeping, and great mourning,</span></span><br /><span class="text Matt-2-18"><span class="oblique">Rachel weeping</span> <i>for</i> <span class="oblique">her children,</span></span><br /><span class="text Matt-2-18"><span class="oblique">Refusing to be comforted,</span></span><br /><span class="text Matt-2-18"><span class="oblique">Because they are no more.&#8221;</span></span></p></div> <h3>
The Home in Nazareth</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-2-19"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Now when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>saying, &#8220;Arise, take the young Child and His mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the young Child&#8217;s life are dead.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then he arose, took the young Child and His mother, and came into the land of Israel.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea instead of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned by God in a dream, he turned aside into the region of Galilee. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, &#8220;He shall be called a Nazarene.&#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-23171a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Matthew 2:1">Matthew 2:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Gr. <i>magoi</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-23177b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Matthew 2:7">Matthew 2:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Gr. <i>magoi</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
