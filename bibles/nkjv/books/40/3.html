<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and saying, &#8220;Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Matt-3-3"><span class="oblique">&#8220;The voice of one crying in the wilderness:</span></span><br /><span class="text Matt-3-3"><span class="oblique">&#8216;Prepare the way of the</span> <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span><span class="oblique">;</span></span><br /><span class="text Matt-3-3"><span class="oblique">Make His paths straight.&#8217; &#8221;</span></span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Now John himself was clothed in camel&#8217;s hair, with a leather belt around his waist; and his food was locusts and wild honey. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then Jerusalem, all Judea, and all the region around the Jordan went out to him </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and were baptized by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, &#8220;Brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Therefore bear fruits worthy of repentance, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and do not think to say to yourselves, &#8216;We have Abraham as <i>our</i> father.&#8217; For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And even now the ax is laid to the root of the trees. Therefore every tree which does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>and fire. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>His winnowing fan <i>is</i> in His hand, and He will thoroughly clean out His threshing floor, and gather His wheat into the barn; but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
John Baptizes Jesus</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-3-13"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan to be baptized by him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And John <i>tried to</i> prevent Him, saying, &#8220;I need to be baptized by You, and are You coming to me?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But Jesus answered and said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;Permit <i>it to be so</i> now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.&#8221;</span> Then he allowed Him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/3-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>When He had been baptized, Jesus came up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened to Him, and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting upon Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And suddenly a voice <i>came</i> from heaven, saying, &#8220;This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.&#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-23204a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Matthew 3:11">Matthew 3:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>M omits <i>and fire</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-23209b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Matthew 3:16">Matthew 3:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>he</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
