<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span><span class="woj">Now when he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span><span class="woj">And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span><span class="woj">and said to them, &#8216;You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you.&#8217; So they went.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span><span class="woj">Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did likewise.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span><span class="woj">And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span><span class="woj">idle, and said to them, &#8216;Why have you been standing here idle all day?&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span><span class="woj">They said to him, &#8216;Because no one hired us.&#8217; He said to them, &#8216;You also go into the vineyard,</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span><span class="woj">and whatever is right you will receive.&#8217;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;So when evening had come, the owner of the vineyard said to his steward, &#8216;Call the laborers and give them <i>their</i> wages, beginning with the last to the first.&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span><span class="woj">And when those came who <i>were hired</i> about the eleventh hour, they each received a denarius.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><span class="woj">But when the first came, they supposed that they would receive more; and they likewise received each a denarius.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span><span class="woj">And when they had received <i>it,</i> they</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span><span class="woj">complained against the landowner,</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span><span class="woj">saying, &#8216;These last <i>men</i> have worked <i>only</i> one hour, and you made them equal to us who have borne the burden and the heat of the day.&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span><span class="woj">But he answered one of them and said, &#8216;Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a denarius?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span><span class="woj">Take <i>what is</i> yours and go your way. I wish to give to this last man <i>the same</i> as to you.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span><span class="woj">Is it not lawful for me to do what I wish with my own things? Or</span> <span class="woj">is your eye evil because I am good?&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span><span class="woj">So the last will be first, and the first last.</span> <span class="woj">For</span><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span> <span class="woj">many are called, but few chosen.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Jesus a Third Time Predicts His Death and Resurrection</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-20-17"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Now Jesus, going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples aside on the road and said to them, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and to the scribes; and they will condemn Him to death,</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span><span class="woj">and deliver Him to the Gentiles to</span> <span class="woj">mock and to</span> <span class="woj">scourge and to</span> <span class="woj">crucify. And the third day He will</span> <span class="woj">rise again.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Greatness Is Serving</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-20-20"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then the mother of Zebedee&#8217;s sons came to Him with her sons, kneeling down and asking something from Him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And He said to her, <span class="woj">&#8220;What do you wish?&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span class="text Matt-20-21">She said to Him, &#8220;Grant that these two sons of mine may sit, one on Your right hand and the other on the left, in Your kingdom.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But Jesus answered and said, <span class="woj">&#8220;You do not know what you ask. Are you able to drink</span> <span class="woj">the cup that I am about to drink,</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span><span class="woj">and be baptized with</span> <span class="woj">the baptism that I am baptized with?&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span class="text Matt-20-22">They said to Him, &#8220;We are able.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>So He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;You will indeed drink My cup,</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span><span class="woj">and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with; but to sit on My right hand and on My left is not Mine to give, but <i>it is for those</i> for whom it is prepared by My Father.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And when the ten heard <i>it,</i> they were greatly displeased with the two brothers. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>But Jesus called them to <i>Himself</i> and said, <span class="woj">&#8220;You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those who are great exercise authority over them.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span><span class="woj">Yet</span> <span class="woj">it shall not be so among you; but</span> <span class="woj">whoever desires to become great among you, let him be your servant.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span><span class="woj">And whoever desires to be first among you, let him be your slave&#8212;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span><span class="woj">just as the</span> <span class="woj">Son of Man did not come to be served,</span> <span class="woj">but to serve, and</span> <span class="woj">to give His life a ransom</span> <span class="woj">for many.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Two Blind Men Receive Their Sight</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-20-29"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Now as they went out of Jericho, a great multitude followed Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And behold, two blind men sitting by the road, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying, &#8220;Have mercy on us, O Lord, Son of David!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Then the multitude warned them that they should be quiet; but they cried out all the more, saying, &#8220;Have mercy on us, O Lord, Son of David!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>So Jesus stood still and called them, and said, <span class="woj">&#8220;What do you want Me to do for you?&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>They said to Him, &#8220;Lord, that our eyes may be opened.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>So Jesus had compassion and touched their eyes.
