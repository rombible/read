<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span><span class="woj">Now five of them were wise, and five <i>were</i> foolish.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span><span class="woj">Those who <i>were</i> foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them,</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span><span class="woj">but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span><span class="woj">But while the bridegroom was delayed,</span> <span class="woj">they all slumbered and slept.</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;And at midnight</span> <span class="woj">a cry was <i>heard:</i> &#8216;Behold, the bridegroom</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span><span class="woj">is coming; go out to meet him!&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span><span class="woj">Then all those virgins arose and</span> <span class="woj">trimmed their lamps.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><span class="woj">And the foolish said to the wise, &#8216;Give us <i>some</i> of your oil, for our lamps are going out.&#8217;</span> </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><span class="woj">And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding; and</span> <span class="woj">the door was shut.</span></span></p> <p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;Watch therefore, for you</span> <span class="woj">know neither the day nor the hour</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span><span class="woj">in which the Son of Man is coming.</span></span></p> <h3>
The Parable of the Talents</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-25-14"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;For <i>the kingdom of heaven is</i></span> <span class="woj">like a man traveling to a far country, <i>who</i> called his own servants and delivered his goods to them.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span><span class="woj">And to one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one,</span> <span class="woj">to each according to his own ability; and immediately he went on a journey.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span><span class="woj">Then he who had received the five talents went and traded with them, and made another five talents.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span><span class="woj">And likewise he who <i>had received</i> two gained two more also.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span><span class="woj">But he who had received one went and dug in the ground, and hid his lord&#8217;s money.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span><span class="woj">After a long time the lord of those servants came and settled accounts with them.</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;So he who had received five talents came and brought five other talents, saying, &#8216;Lord, you delivered to me five talents; look, I have gained five more talents besides them.&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span><span class="woj">His lord said to him, &#8216;Well <i>done,</i> good and faithful servant; you were</span> <span class="woj">faithful over a few things,</span> <span class="woj">I will make you ruler over many things. Enter into</span> <span class="woj">the joy of your lord.&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span><span class="woj">He also who had received two talents came and said, &#8216;Lord, you delivered to me two talents; look, I have gained two more talents besides them.&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span><span class="woj">His lord said to him,</span> <span class="woj">&#8216;Well <i>done,</i> good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things. Enter into</span> <span class="woj">the joy of your lord.&#8217;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;Then he who had received the one talent came and said, &#8216;Lord, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you have not sown, and gathering where you have not scattered seed.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span><span class="woj">And I was afraid, and went and hid your talent in the ground. Look, <i>there</i> you have <i>what is</i> yours.&#8217;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;But his lord answered and said to him, &#8216;You</span> <span class="woj">wicked and lazy servant, you knew that I reap where I have not sown, and gather where I have not scattered seed.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span><span class="woj">So you ought to have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming I would have received back my own with interest.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span><span class="woj">So take the talent from him, and give <i>it</i> to him who has ten talents.</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8216;For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who does not have, even what he has will be taken away.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span><span class="woj">And cast the unprofitable servant</span> <span class="woj">into the outer darkness.</span> <span class="woj">There will be weeping and</span> <span class="woj">gnashing of teeth.&#8217;</span></span></p> <h3>
