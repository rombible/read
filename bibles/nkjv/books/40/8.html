<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And behold, a leper came and worshiped Him, saying, &#8220;Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then Jesus put out <i>His</i> hand and touched him, saying, <span class="woj">&#8220;I am willing; be cleansed.&#8221;</span> Immediately his leprosy was cleansed.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And Jesus said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;See that you tell no one; but go your way, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that</span> <span class="woj">Moses</span> <span class="woj">commanded, as a testimony to them.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Jesus Heals a Centurion&#8217;s Servant</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-8-5"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now when Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to Him, pleading with Him, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>saying, &#8220;Lord, my servant is lying at home paralyzed, dreadfully tormented.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And Jesus said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;I will come and heal him.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>The centurion answered and said, &#8220;Lord, I am not worthy that You should come under my roof. But only speak a word, and my servant will be healed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For I also am a man under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to this <i>one,</i> &#8216;Go,&#8217; and he goes; and to another, &#8216;Come,&#8217; and he comes; and to my servant, &#8216;Do this,&#8217; and he does <i>it.</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>When Jesus heard <i>it,</i> He marveled, and said to those who followed, <span class="woj">&#8220;Assuredly, I say to you, I have not found such great faith, not even in Israel!</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span><span class="woj">And I say to you that</span> <span class="woj">many will come from east and west, and sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span><span class="woj">But</span> <span class="woj">the sons of the kingdom</span> <span class="woj">will be cast out into outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then Jesus said to the centurion, <span class="woj">&#8220;Go your way; and as you have believed, <i>so</i> let it be done for you.&#8221;</span> And his servant was healed that same hour.</span></p> <h3>
Peter&#8217;s Mother-in-Law Healed</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-8-14"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Now when Jesus had come into Peter&#8217;s house, He saw his wife&#8217;s mother lying sick with a fever. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So He touched her hand, and the fever left her. And she arose and served <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>them.</span></p> <h3>
Many Healed in the Evening</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-8-16"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>When evening had come, they brought to Him many who were demon-possessed. And He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Matt-8-17">&#8220;<span class="oblique">He Himself took our infirmities</span></span><br /><span class="text Matt-8-17"><span class="oblique">And bore</span> <i>our</i> <span class="oblique">sicknesses.&#8221;</span></span></p></div> <h3>
The Cost of Discipleship</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-8-18"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And when Jesus saw great multitudes about Him, He gave a command to depart to the other side. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then a certain scribe came and said to Him, &#8220;Teacher, I will follow You wherever You go.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And Jesus said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;Foxes have holes and birds of the air <i>have</i> nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay <i>His</i> head.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then another of His disciples said to Him, &#8220;Lord, let me first go and bury my father.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But Jesus said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Wind and Wave Obey Jesus</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-8-23"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Now when He got into a boat, His disciples followed Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And suddenly a great tempest arose on the sea, so that the boat was covered with the waves. But He was asleep. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then His disciples came to <i>Him</i> and awoke Him, saying, &#8220;Lord, save us! We are perishing!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>But He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Why are you fearful, O you of little faith?&#8221;</span> Then He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>So the men marveled, saying, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>&#8220;Who can this be, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Two Demon-Possessed Men Healed</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-8-28"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>When He had come to the other side, to the country of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Gergesenes, there met Him two demon-possessed <i>men,</i> coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that no one could pass that way. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And suddenly they cried out, saying, &#8220;What have we to do with You, Jesus, You Son of God? Have You come here to torment us before the time?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Now a good way off from them there was a herd of many swine feeding. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>So the demons begged Him, saying, &#8220;If You cast us out, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>permit us to go away into the herd of swine.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Go.&#8221;</span> So when they had come out, they went into the herd of swine. And suddenly the whole herd of swine ran violently down the steep place into the sea, and perished in the water.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Then those who kept <i>them</i> fled; and they went away into the city and told everything, including what <i>had happened</i> to the demon-possessed <i>men.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw Him, they begged <i>Him</i> to depart from their region.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-23361a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Matthew 8:15">Matthew 8:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M <i>Him</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-23373b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Matthew 8:27">Matthew 8:27</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>What sort of man is this</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-23374c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Matthew 8:28">Matthew 8:28</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>Gadarenes</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-23377d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Matthew 8:31">Matthew 8:31</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>send us into</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
