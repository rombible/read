<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Why do Your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>He answered and said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Why do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span><span class="woj">For God commanded, saying,</span> <span class="woj">&#8216;Honor your father and your mother&#8217;; and,</span> <span class="woj">&#8216;He who curses father or mother, let him be put to death.&#8217;</span> </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>When He had called the multitude to <i>Himself,</i> He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Hear and understand:</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span><span class="woj">Not what goes into the mouth defiles a man; but what comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then His disciples came and said to Him, &#8220;Do You know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>But He answered and said, <span class="woj">&#8220;Every plant which My heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span><span class="woj">Let them alone.</span> <span class="woj">They are blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind leads the blind, both will fall into a ditch.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then Peter answered and said to Him, &#8220;Explain this parable to us.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So Jesus said, <span class="woj">&#8220;Are you also still without understanding?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span><span class="woj">Do you not yet understand that</span> <span class="woj">whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and is eliminated?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span><span class="woj">But</span> <span class="woj">those things which proceed out of the mouth come from the heart, and they defile a man.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span><span class="woj">For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span><span class="woj">These are <i>the things</i> which defile a man, but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
A Gentile Shows Her Faith</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-15-21"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then Jesus went out from there and departed to the region of Tyre and Sidon. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And behold, a woman of Canaan came from that region and cried out to Him, saying, &#8220;Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David! My daughter is severely demon-possessed.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>But He answered her not a word.</span></p><p><span class="text Matt-15-23">And His disciples came and urged Him, saying, &#8220;Send her away, for she cries out after us.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>But He answered and said, <span class="woj">&#8220;I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then she came and worshiped Him, saying, &#8220;Lord, help me!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>But He answered and said, <span class="woj">&#8220;It is not good to take the children&#8217;s bread and throw <i>it</i> to the little</span> <span class="woj">dogs.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And she said, &#8220;Yes, Lord, yet even the little dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters&#8217; table.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then Jesus answered and said to her, <span class="woj">&#8220;O woman,</span> <span class="woj">great <i>is</i> your faith! Let it be to you as you desire.&#8221;</span> And her daughter was healed from that very hour.</span></p> <h3>
Jesus Heals Great Multitudes</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-15-29"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Jesus departed from there, skirted the Sea of Galilee, and went up on the mountain and sat down there. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Then great multitudes came to Him, having with them <i>the</i> lame, blind, mute, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>maimed, and many others; and they laid them down at Jesus&#8217; feet, and He healed them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>So the multitude marveled when they saw <i>the</i> mute speaking, <i>the</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>maimed made whole, <i>the</i> lame walking, and <i>the</i> blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel.</span></p> <h3>
Feeding the Four Thousand</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-15-32"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Now Jesus called His disciples to <i>Himself</i> and said, <span class="woj">&#8220;I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now continued with Me three days and have nothing to eat. And I do not want to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Then His disciples said to Him, &#8220;Where could we get enough bread in the wilderness to fill such a great multitude?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Jesus said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;How many loaves do you have?&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span class="text Matt-15-34">And they said, &#8220;Seven, and a few little fish.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>So He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>And He took the seven loaves and the fish and gave thanks, broke <i>them</i> and gave <i>them</i> to His disciples; and the disciples <i>gave</i> to the multitude. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>So they all ate and were filled, and they took up seven large baskets full of the fragments that were left. </span>
