<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/18-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then Jesus called a little child to Him, set him in the midst of them, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/18-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and said, <span class="woj">&#8220;Assuredly, I say to you,</span> <span class="woj">unless you are converted and become as little children, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/18-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span><span class="woj">Therefore whoever humbles himself as this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/18-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span><span class="woj">Whoever receives one little child like this in My name receives Me.</span></span></p> <h3>
Jesus Warns of Offenses</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-18-6"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/18-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to sin, it would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck, and he were drowned in the depth of the sea.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/18-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span><span class="woj">Woe to the world because of</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span><span class="woj">offenses! For</span> <span class="woj">offenses must come, but</span> <span class="woj">woe to that man by whom the offense comes!</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/18-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and cast <i>it</i> from you. It is better for you to enter into life lame or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet, to be cast into the everlasting fire.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/18-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span><span class="woj">And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and cast <i>it</i> from you.

The Parable of the Lost Sheep</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-18-10"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/18-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;Take heed that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you that in heaven</span> <span class="woj">their angels always</span> <span class="woj">see the face of My Father who is in heaven.</span> </span> 
11<span class="woj">For</span><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> <span class="woj">the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost.</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/18-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine and go to the mountains to seek the one that is straying?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/18-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span><span class="woj">And if he should find it, assuredly, I say to you, he rejoices more over that <i>sheep</i> than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/18-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span><span class="woj">Even so it is not the</span> <span class="woj">will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.</span></span></p> <h3>
Dealing with a Sinning Brother</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-18-15"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/18-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;Moreover</span> <span class="woj">if your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault between you and him alone. If he hears you,</span> <span class="woj">you have gained your brother.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/18-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span><span class="woj">But if he will not hear, take with you one or two more, that</span> <span class="woj">&#8216;by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/18-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span><span class="woj">And if he refuses to hear them, tell <i>it</i> to the church. But if he refuses even to hear the church, let him be to you like a</span> <span class="woj">heathen and a tax collector.</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/18-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;Assuredly, I say to you,</span> <span class="woj">whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/18-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;Again</span><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span> <span class="woj">I say to you that if two of you agree on earth concerning anything that they ask,</span> <span class="woj">it will be done for them by My Father in heaven.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/18-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span><span class="woj">For where two or three are gathered</span> <span class="woj">together in My name, I am there in the midst of them.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
The Parable of the Unforgiving Servant</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-18-21"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/18-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then Peter came to Him and said, &#8220;Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Up to seven times?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/18-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Jesus said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;I do not say to you,</span> <span class="woj">up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/18-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span><span class="woj">Therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/18-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span><span class="woj">And when he had begun to settle accounts, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/18-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span><span class="woj">But as he was not able to pay, his master commanded</span> <span class="woj">that he be sold, with his wife and children and all that he had, and that payment be made.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/18-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span><span class="woj">The servant therefore fell down before him, saying, &#8216;Master, have patience with me, and I will pay you all.&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/18-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span><span class="woj">Then the master of that servant was moved with compassion, released him, and forgave him the debt.</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/18-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;But that servant went out and found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii; and he laid hands on him and took <i>him</i> by the throat, saying, &#8216;Pay me what you owe!&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/18-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span><span class="woj">So his fellow servant fell down</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span><span class="woj">at his feet and begged him, saying, &#8216;Have patience with me, and I will pay you</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span><span class="woj">all.&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/18-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span><span class="woj">And he would not, but went and threw him into prison till he should pay the debt.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/18-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span><span class="woj">So when his fellow servants saw what had been done, they were very grieved, and came and told their master all that had been done.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/18-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span><span class="woj">Then his master, after he had called him, said to him, &#8216;You wicked servant! I forgave you</span> <span class="woj">all that debt because you begged me.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/18-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span><span class="woj">Should you not also have had compassion on your fellow servant, just as I had pity on you?&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/18-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span><span class="woj">And his master was angry, and delivered him to the torturers until he should pay all that was due to him.</span></span></p> <p>
