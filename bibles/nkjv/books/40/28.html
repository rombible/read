<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>from the door, and sat on it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>His countenance was like lightning, and his clothing as white as snow. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And the guards shook for fear of him, and became like dead <i>men.</i></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But the angel answered and said to the women, &#8220;Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>He is not here; for He is risen, as He said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And go quickly and tell His disciples that He is risen from the dead, and indeed He is going before you into Galilee; there you will see Him. Behold, I have told you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So they went out quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring His disciples word.</span></p> <h3>
The Women Worship the Risen Lord</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-28-9"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>as they went to tell His disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, <span class="woj">&#8220;Rejoice!&#8221;</span> So they came and held Him by the feet and worshiped Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then Jesus said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Do not be afraid. Go <i>and</i> tell</span> <span class="woj">My brethren to go to Galilee, and there they will see Me.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
The Soldiers Are Bribed</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-28-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now while they were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city and reported to the chief priests all the things that had happened. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>When they had assembled with the elders and consulted together, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>saying, &#8220;Tell them, &#8216;His disciples came at night and stole Him <i>away</i> while we slept.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And if this comes to the governor&#8217;s ears, we will appease him and make you secure.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So they took the money and did as they were instructed; and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.</span></p> <h3>
The Great Commission</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-28-16"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus had appointed for them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>When they saw Him, they worshiped Him; but some doubted.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, <span class="woj">&#8220;All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span><span class="woj">Go</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span><span class="woj">therefore and</span> <span class="woj">make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,</span> </span>
