<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;The kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who arranged a marriage for his son,</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span><span class="woj">and sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding; and they were not willing to come.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span><span class="woj">Again, he sent out other servants, saying, &#8216;Tell those who are invited, &#8220;See, I have prepared my dinner;</span> <span class="woj">my oxen and fatted cattle <i>are</i> killed, and all things <i>are</i> ready. Come to the wedding.&#8221; &#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span><span class="woj">But they made light of it and went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his business.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span><span class="woj">And the rest seized his servants, treated <i>them</i></span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span><span class="woj">spitefully, and killed <i>them.</i></span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span><span class="woj">But when the king heard <i>about it,</i> he was furious. And he sent out</span> <span class="woj">his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><span class="woj">Then he said to his servants, &#8216;The wedding is ready, but those who were invited were not</span> <span class="woj">worthy.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span><span class="woj">Therefore go into the highways, and as many as you find, invite to the wedding.&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><span class="woj">So those servants went out into the highways and</span> <span class="woj">gathered together all whom they found, both bad and good. And the wedding <i>hall</i> was filled with guests.</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw a man there</span> <span class="woj">who did not have on a wedding garment.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span><span class="woj">So he said to him, &#8216;Friend, how did you come in here without a wedding garment?&#8217; And he was</span> <span class="woj">speechless.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span><span class="woj">Then the king said to the servants, &#8216;Bind him hand and foot,</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span><span class="woj">take him away, and cast <i>him</i></span> <span class="woj">into outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.&#8217;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;For many are called, but few <i>are</i> chosen.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
The Pharisees: Is It Lawful to Pay Taxes to Caesar?</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-22-15"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then the Pharisees went and plotted how they might entangle Him in <i>His</i> talk. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And they sent to Him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, &#8220;Teacher, we know that You are true, and teach the way of God in truth; nor do You care about anyone, for You do not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>regard the person of men. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Tell us, therefore, what do You think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>But Jesus <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>perceived their wickedness, and said, <span class="woj">&#8220;Why do you test Me, <i>you</i> hypocrites?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span><span class="woj">Show Me the tax money.&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span class="text Matt-22-19">So they brought Him a denarius.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Whose image and inscription <i>is</i> this?&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>They said to Him, &#8220;Caesar&#8217;s.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Matt-22-21">And He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Render</span><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span> <span class="woj">therefore to Caesar the things that are</span> <span class="woj">Caesar&#8217;s, and to God the things that are</span> <span class="woj">God&#8217;s.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>When they had heard <i>these words,</i> they marveled, and left Him and went their way.</span></p> <h3>
The Sadducees: What About the Resurrection?</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-22-23"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>The same day the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Him and asked Him, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>saying: &#8220;Teacher, Moses said that if a man dies, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife and raise up offspring for his brother. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Now there were with us seven brothers. The first died after he had married, and having no offspring, left his wife to his brother. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Likewise the second also, and the third, even to the seventh. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Last of all the woman died also. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife of the seven will she be? For they all had her.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Jesus answered and said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;You are</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span><span class="woj">mistaken,</span> <span class="woj">not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span><span class="woj">For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but</span> <span class="woj">are like angels</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span><span class="woj">of God in heaven.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span><span class="woj">But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God, saying,</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8216;I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob&#8217;? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And when the multitudes heard <i>this,</i> they were astonished at His teaching.</span></p> <h3>
The Scribes: Which Is the First Commandment of All?</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-22-34"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>But when the Pharisees heard that He had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Then one of them, a lawyer, asked <i>Him a question,</i> testing Him, and saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>&#8220;Teacher, which <i>is</i> the great commandment in the law?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>Jesus said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;&#8216;You shall love the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.&#8217;</span> </span>
