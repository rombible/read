<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then behold, they brought to Him a paralytic lying on a bed. When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, <span class="woj">&#8220;Son, be of good cheer; your sins are forgiven you.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And at once some of the scribes said within themselves, &#8220;This Man blasphemes!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, <span class="woj">&#8220;Why do you think evil in your hearts?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span><span class="woj">For which is easier, to say, &#8216;<i>Your</i> sins are forgiven you,&#8217; or to say, &#8216;Arise and walk&#8217;?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span><span class="woj">But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins&#8221;</span>&#8212;then He said to the paralytic, <span class="woj">&#8220;Arise, take up your bed, and go to your house.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And he arose and departed to his house.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Now when the multitudes saw <i>it,</i> they marveled<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span> and glorified God, who had given such power to men.</span></p> <h3>
Matthew the Tax Collector</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-9-9"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>As Jesus passed on from there, He saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax office. And He said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;Follow Me.&#8221;</span> So he arose and followed Him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Now it happened, as Jesus sat at the table in the house, <i>that</i> behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with Him and His disciples. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And when the Pharisees saw <i>it,</i> they said to His disciples, &#8220;Why does your Teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>When Jesus heard <i>that,</i> He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span><span class="woj">But go and learn what <i>this</i> means:</span> <span class="woj">&#8216;I desire mercy and not sacrifice.&#8217; For I did not come to call the righteous,</span> <span class="woj">but sinners,</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span><span class="woj">to repentance.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Jesus Is Questioned About Fasting</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-9-14"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then the disciples of John came to Him, saying, &#8220;Why do we and the Pharisees fast <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>often, but Your disciples do not fast?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And Jesus said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Can</span> <span class="woj">the</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span><span class="woj">friends of the bridegroom mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and</span> <span class="woj">then they will fast.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span><span class="woj">No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span><span class="woj">the patch pulls away from the garment, and the tear is made worse.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span><span class="woj">Nor do they put new wine into old wineskins, or else the wineskins</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span><span class="woj">break, the wine is spilled, and the wineskins are ruined. But they put new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
A Girl Restored to Life and a Woman Healed</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-9-18"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>While He spoke these things to them, behold, a ruler came and worshiped Him, saying, &#8220;My daughter has just died, but come and lay Your hand on her and she will live.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>So Jesus arose and followed him, and so <i>did</i> His disciples.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And suddenly, a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years came from behind and touched the hem of His garment. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>For she said to herself, &#8220;If only I may touch His garment, I shall be made well.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But Jesus turned around, and when He saw her He said, <span class="woj">&#8220;Be of good cheer, daughter;</span> <span class="woj">your faith has made you well.&#8221;</span> And the woman was made well from that hour.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>When Jesus came into the ruler&#8217;s house, and saw the flute players and the noisy crowd wailing, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Make room, for the girl is not dead, but sleeping.&#8221;</span> And they ridiculed Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>But when the crowd was put outside, He went in and took her by the hand, and the girl arose. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And the report of this went out into all that land.</span></p> <h3>
Two Blind Men Healed</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-9-27"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>When Jesus departed from there, two blind men followed Him, crying out and saying, &#8220;Son of David, have mercy on us!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And when He had come into the house, the blind men came to Him. And Jesus said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Do you believe that I am able to do this?&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span class="text Matt-9-28">They said to Him, &#8220;Yes, Lord.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Then He touched their eyes, saying, <span class="woj">&#8220;According to your faith let it be to you.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly warned them, saying, <span class="woj">&#8220;See <i>that</i> no one knows <i>it</i>.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>But when they had departed, they <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>spread the news about Him in all that <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>country.</span></p> <h3>
A Mute Man Speaks</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-9-32"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>As they went out, behold, they brought to Him a man, mute and demon-possessed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And when the demon was cast out, the mute spoke. And the multitudes marveled, saying, &#8220;It was never seen like this in Israel!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>But the Pharisees said, &#8220;He casts out demons by the ruler of the demons.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
The Compassion of Jesus</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-9-35"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Then Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>among the people. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>But when He saw the multitudes, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>weary and scattered, like sheep having no shepherd. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>Then He said to His disciples, <span class="woj">&#8220;The harvest truly <i>is</i> plentiful, but the laborers <i>are</i> few.</span> </span>
