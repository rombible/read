<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and He was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and His clothes became as white as the light. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then Peter answered and said to Jesus, &#8220;Lord, it is good for us to be here; if You wish, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>let us make here three tabernacles: one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them; and suddenly a voice came out of the cloud, saying, &#8220;This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Hear Him!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And when the disciples heard <i>it,</i> they fell on their faces and were greatly afraid. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But Jesus came and touched them and said, <span class="woj">&#8220;Arise, and do not be afraid.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>When they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus only.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Now as they came down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, <span class="woj">&#8220;Tell the vision to no one until the Son of Man is risen from the dead.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And His disciples asked Him, saying, &#8220;Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Jesus answered and said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Indeed, Elijah is coming</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span><span class="woj">first and will</span> <span class="woj">restore all things.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span><span class="woj">But I say to you that Elijah has come already, and they</span> <span class="woj">did not know him but did to him whatever they wished. Likewise</span> <span class="woj">the Son of Man is also about to suffer at their hands.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then the disciples understood that He spoke to them of John the Baptist.</span></p> <h3>
A Boy Is Healed</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-17-14"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And when they had come to the multitude, a man came to Him, kneeling down to Him and saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>&#8220;Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>an epileptic and suffers severely; for he often falls into the fire and often into the water. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So I brought him to Your disciples, but they could not cure him.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then Jesus answered and said, <span class="woj">&#8220;O</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span><span class="woj">faithless and</span> <span class="woj">perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him here to Me.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of him; and the child was cured from that very hour.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, &#8220;Why could we not cast it out?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So Jesus said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Because of your</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span><span class="woj">unbelief; for assuredly, I say to you,</span> <span class="woj">if you have faith as a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, &#8216;Move from here to there,&#8217; and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you.</span> </span> 
21<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span><span class="woj">However, this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Jesus Again Predicts His Death and Resurrection</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-17-22"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Now while they were <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>staying in Galilee, Jesus said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;The Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men,</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span><span class="woj">and they will kill Him, and the third day He will be raised up.&#8221;</span> And they were exceedingly sorrowful.</span></p> <h3>
Peter and His Master Pay Their Taxes</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-17-24"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>When they had come to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>Capernaum, those who received the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span><i>temple</i> tax came to Peter and said, &#8220;Does your Teacher not pay the <i>temple</i> tax?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>He said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Matt-17-25">And when he had come into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, <span class="woj">&#8220;What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth take customs or taxes, from their sons or from</span> <span class="woj">strangers?&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Peter said to Him, &#8220;From strangers.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Matt-17-26">Jesus said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;Then the sons are free.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span><span class="woj">Nevertheless, lest we offend them, go to the sea, cast in a hook, and take the fish that comes up first.
