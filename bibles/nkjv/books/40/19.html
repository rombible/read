<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/19-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And great multitudes followed Him, and He healed them there.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/19-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>The Pharisees also came to Him, testing Him, and saying to Him, &#8220;Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for <i>just</i> any reason?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/19-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And He answered and said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Have you not read that He who</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span><span class="woj">made <i>them</i> at the beginning</span> <span class="woj">&#8216;made them male and female,&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/19-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span><span class="woj">and said,</span> <span class="woj">&#8216;For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and</span> <span class="woj">the two shall become one flesh&#8217;?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/19-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span><span class="woj">So then, they are no longer two but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let not man separate.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/19-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>They said to Him, &#8220;Why then did Moses command to give a certificate of divorce, and to put her away?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/19-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Moses, because of the</span> <span class="woj">hardness of your hearts, permitted you to divorce your</span> <span class="woj">wives, but from the beginning it was not so.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/19-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span><span class="woj">And I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span><span class="woj">sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and whoever marries her who is divorced commits adultery.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/19-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>His disciples said to Him, &#8220;If such is the case of the man with <i>his</i> wife, it is better not to marry.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Jesus Teaches on Celibacy</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-19-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/19-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;All cannot accept this saying, but only <i>those</i> to whom it has been given:</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/19-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span><span class="woj">For there are</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span><span class="woj">eunuchs who were born thus from <i>their</i> mother&#8217;s womb, and</span> <span class="woj">there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven&#8217;s sake. He who is able to accept <i>it,</i> let him accept <i>it.&#8221;</i></span></span></p> <h3>
Jesus Blesses Little Children</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-19-13"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/19-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then little children were brought to Him that He might put <i>His</i> hands on them and pray, but the disciples rebuked them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/19-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But Jesus said, <span class="woj">&#8220;Let the little children come to Me, and do not forbid them; for</span> <span class="woj">of such is the kingdom of heaven.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/19-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And He laid <i>His</i> hands on them and departed from there.</span></p> <h3>
Jesus Counsels the Rich Young Ruler</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-19-16"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/19-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Now behold, one came and said to Him, &#8220;Good<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span> Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/19-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So He said to him, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;Why do you call Me good?</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span><span class="woj">No one <i>is</i></span> <span class="woj">good but One, <i>that is,</i> God. But if you want to enter into life,</span> <span class="woj">keep the commandments.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/19-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>He said to Him, &#8220;Which ones?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Matt-19-18">Jesus said, <span class="woj">&#8220;&#8216;You shall not murder,&#8217; &#8216;You shall not commit adultery,&#8217; &#8216;You shall not steal,&#8217; &#8216;You shall not bear false witness,&#8217;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/19-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8216;Honor your father and <i>your</i> mother,&#8217; and,</span> <span class="woj">&#8216;You shall love your neighbor as yourself.&#8217;</span> <span class="woj">&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/19-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>The young man said to Him, &#8220;All these things I have kept <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>from my youth. What do I still lack?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/19-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Jesus said to him, <span class="woj">&#8220;If you want to be perfect,</span> <span class="woj">go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/19-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.</span></p> <h3>
With God All Things Are Possible</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-19-23"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/19-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Then Jesus said to His disciples, <span class="woj">&#8220;Assuredly, I say to you that</span> <span class="woj">it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/19-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span><span class="woj">And again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/19-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>When His disciples heard <i>it,</i> they were greatly astonished, saying, &#8220;Who then can be saved?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/19-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>But Jesus looked at <i>them</i> and said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;With men this is impossible, but</span> <span class="woj">with God all things are possible.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/19-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Then Peter answered and said to Him, &#8220;See, we have left all and followed You. Therefore what shall we have?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/19-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>So Jesus said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Assuredly I say to you, that in the regeneration, when the Son of Man sits on the throne of His glory,</span> <span class="woj">you who have followed Me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/19-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span><span class="woj">And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span><span class="woj">or wife or children or</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span><span class="woj">lands, for My name&#8217;s sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and inherit eternal life.</span> </span>
