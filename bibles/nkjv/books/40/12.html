And His disciples were hungry, and began to pluck heads of grain and to eat. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And when the Pharisees saw <i>it,</i> they said to Him, &#8220;Look, Your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Have you not read</span> <span class="woj">what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him:</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span><span class="woj">how he entered the house of God and ate</span> <span class="woj">the showbread which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him,</span> <span class="woj">but only for the priests?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span><span class="woj">Or have you not read in the</span> <span class="woj">law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span><span class="woj">profane the Sabbath, and are blameless?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span><span class="woj">Yet I say to you that in this place there is</span> <span class="woj"><i>One</i> greater than the temple.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span><span class="woj">But if you had known what <i>this</i> means,</span> <span class="woj">&#8216;I desire mercy and not sacrifice,&#8217; you would not have condemned the guiltless.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><span class="woj">For the Son of Man is Lord</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span><span class="woj">even of the Sabbath.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
Healing on the Sabbath</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-12-9"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Now when He had departed from there, He went into their synagogue. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And behold, there was a man who had a withered hand. And they asked Him, saying, &#8220;Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?&#8221;&#8212;that they might accuse Him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;What man is there among you who has one sheep, and if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not lay hold of it and lift <i>it</i> out?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span><span class="woj">Of how much more value then is a man than a sheep? Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then He said to the man, <span class="woj">&#8220;Stretch out your hand.&#8221;</span> And he stretched <i>it</i> out, and it was restored as whole as the other. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then the Pharisees went out and plotted against Him, how they might destroy Him.</span></p> <h3>
Behold, My Servant</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-12-15"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But when Jesus knew <i>it,</i> He withdrew from there.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Yet He warned them not to make Him known, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying:</span></p> <div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line">

A House Divided Cannot Stand</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-12-22"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then one was brought to Him who was demon-possessed, blind and mute; and He healed him, so that the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>blind and mute man both spoke and saw. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And all the multitudes were amazed and said, &#8220;Could this be the Son of David?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Now when the Pharisees heard <i>it</i> they said, &#8220;This <i>fellow</i> does not cast out demons except by <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>Beelzebub, the ruler of the demons.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>But Jesus knew their thoughts, and said to them: <span class="woj">&#8220;Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span><span class="woj">If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span><span class="woj">And if I cast out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons cast <i>them</i> out? Therefore they shall be your judges.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span><span class="woj">But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God,</span> <span class="woj">surely the kingdom of God has come upon you.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span><span class="woj">Or how can one enter a strong man&#8217;s house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? And then he will plunder his house.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span><span class="woj">He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters abroad.</span></span></p> <h3>
The Unpardonable Sin</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-12-31"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;Therefore I say to you,</span> <span class="woj">every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men,</span> <span class="woj">but the blasphemy <i>against</i> the Spirit will not be forgiven men.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span><span class="woj">Anyone who</span> <span class="woj">speaks a word against the Son of Man,</span> <span class="woj">it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, either in this age or in the <i>age</i> to come.</span></span></p> <h3>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span><span class="woj">A good man out of the good treasure</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span><span class="woj">of his heart brings forth good things, and an evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth evil things.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span><span class="woj">But I say to you that for every idle word men may speak, they will give account of it in the day of judgment.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span><span class="woj">For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.&#8221;</span></span></p> <h3>
The Scribes and Pharisees Ask for a Sign</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-12-38"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered, saying, &#8220;Teacher, we want to see a sign from You.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>But He answered and said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;An evil and</span> <span class="woj">adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span><span class="woj">For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span><span class="woj">The men of Nineveh will rise up in the judgment with this generation and</span> <span class="woj">condemn it,</span> <span class="woj">because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and indeed a greater than Jonah <i>is</i> here.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span><span class="woj">The queen of the South will rise up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and indeed a greater than Solomon <i>is</i> here.</span></span></p> <h3>
