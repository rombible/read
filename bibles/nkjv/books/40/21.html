<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/21-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/21-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>They brought the donkey and the colt, laid their clothes on them, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>and set <i>Him</i> on them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/21-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And a very great multitude spread their clothes on the road; others cut down branches from the trees and spread <i>them</i> on the road. </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/21-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So the multitudes said, &#8220;This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth of Galilee.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Jesus Cleanses the Temple</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-21-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/21-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then Jesus went into the temple <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>of God and drove out all those who bought and sold in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/21-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;It is written,</span> <span class="woj">&#8216;My house shall be called a house of prayer,&#8217; but you have made it a</span> <span class="woj">&#8216;den of thieves.&#8217;</span> <span class="woj">&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/21-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that He did, and the children crying out in the temple and saying, &#8220;Hosanna to the Son of David!&#8221; they were <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>indignant </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/21-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>and said to Him, &#8220;Do You hear what these are saying?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Matt-21-16">And Jesus said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Yes.

The Fig Tree Withered</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-21-18"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/21-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Now in the morning, as He returned to the city, He was hungry. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/21-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And seeing a fig tree by the road, He came to it and found nothing on it but leaves, and said to it, <span class="woj">&#8220;Let no fruit grow on you ever again.&#8221;</span> Immediately the fig tree withered away.</span></p> <h3>
The Lesson of the Withered Fig Tree</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-21-20"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/21-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And when the disciples saw <i>it,</i> they marveled, saying, &#8220;How did the fig tree wither away so soon?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/21-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>So Jesus answered and said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Assuredly, I say to you,</span> <span class="woj">if you have faith and</span> <span class="woj">do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree,</span> <span class="woj">but also if you say to this mountain, &#8216;Be removed and be cast into the sea,&#8217; it will be done.</span> </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/21-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>But Jesus answered and said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;I also will ask you one thing, which if you tell Me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things:</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/21-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span><span class="woj">The</span> <span class="woj">baptism of</span> <span class="woj">John&#8212;where was it from?

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/21-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>But if we say, &#8216;From men,&#8217; we fear the multitude, for all count John as a prophet.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/21-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>So they answered Jesus and said, &#8220;We do not know.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Matt-21-27">And He said to them, <span class="woj">&#8220;Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.</span></span></p> <h3>
The Parable of the Two Sons</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-21-28"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/21-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;But what do you think?

The Parable of the Wicked Vinedressers</span></h3><p><span class="text Matt-21-33"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/21-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;Hear another parable: There was a certain landowner</span> <span class="woj">who planted a vineyard and set a hedge around it, dug a winepress in it and built a tower.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/21-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span><span class="woj">Now when vintage-time drew near, he sent his servants to the vinedressers, that they might receive its fruit.</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/21-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span><span class="woj">And the vinedressers took his servants, beat one, killed one, and stoned another.</span> </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/21-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span><span class="woj">So they took him and cast <i>him</i> out of the vineyard and killed <i>him.</i></span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/21-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span><span class="woj">&#8220;Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those vinedressers?&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
