<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then He caused me to pass by them all around, and behold, <i>there were</i> very many in the open valley; and indeed <i>they were</i> very dry. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And He said to me, &#8220;Son of man, can these bones live?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Ezek-37-3">So I answered, &#8220;O Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>, You know.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Again He said to me, &#8220;Prophesy to these bones, and say to them, &#8216;O dry bones, hear the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span> to these bones: &#8220;Surely I will cause breath to enter into you, and you shall live. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>I will put sinews on you and bring flesh upon you, cover you with skin and put breath in you; and you shall live. Then you shall know that I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221; &#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So I prophesied as I was commanded; and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and suddenly a rattling; and the bones came together, bone to bone. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Indeed, as I looked, the sinews and the flesh came upon them, and the skin covered them over; but <i>there was</i> no breath in them.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Also He said to me, &#8220;Prophesy to the breath, prophesy, son of man, and say to the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>breath, &#8216;Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe on these slain, that they may live.&#8221; &#8217; &#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So I prophesied as He commanded me, and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>breath came into them, and they lived, and stood upon their feet, an exceedingly great army.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then He said to me, &#8220;Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. They indeed say, &#8216;Our bones are dry, our hope is lost, and we ourselves are cut off!&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Therefore prophesy and say to them, &#8216;Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;Behold, O My people, I will open your graves and cause you to come up from your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then you shall know that I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, when I have opened your graves, O My people, and brought you up from your graves. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>I will put My Spirit in you, and you shall live, and I will place you in your own land.

One Kingdom, One King</span></h3><p><span class="text Ezek-37-15"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Again the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came to me, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>&#8220;As for you, son of man, take a stick for yourself and write on it: &#8216;For Judah and for the children of Israel, his companions.&#8217; Then take another stick and write on it, &#8216;For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and <i>for</i> all the house of Israel, his companions.&#8217; </span>
