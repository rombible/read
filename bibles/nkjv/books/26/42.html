<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Facing the length, <i>which was</i> one hundred cubits (the width was fifty cubits), was the north door. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Opposite the inner court of twenty <i>cubits,</i> and opposite the pavement of the outer court, <i>was</i> gallery against gallery in three <i>stories.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>In front of the chambers, toward the inside, <i>was</i> a walk ten cubits wide, at a distance of one cubit; and their doors faced north. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now the upper chambers <i>were</i> shorter, because the galleries took away <i>space</i> from them more than from the lower and middle stories of the building. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>For they <i>were</i> in three <i>stories</i> and did not have pillars like the pillars of the courts; therefore <i>the upper level</i> was <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>shortened more than the lower and middle levels from the ground up. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And a wall which <i>was</i> outside ran parallel to the chambers, at the front of the chambers, toward the outer court; its length <i>was</i> fifty cubits. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>The length of the chambers toward the outer court <i>was</i> fifty cubits, whereas that facing the temple <i>was</i> one hundred cubits. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>At the lower chambers <i>was</i> the entrance on the east side, as one goes into them from the outer court.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Also <i>there were</i> chambers in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, opposite the separating courtyard and opposite the building. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span><i>There was</i> a walk in front of them also, and their appearance <i>was</i> like the chambers which <i>were</i> toward the north; they <i>were</i> as long and as wide as the others, and all their exits and entrances <i>were</i> according to plan. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And corresponding to the doors of the chambers that <i>were</i> facing south, as one enters them, <i>there was</i> a door in front of the walk, the way directly in front of the wall toward the east.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then he said to me, &#8220;The north chambers <i>and</i> the south chambers, which <i>are</i> opposite the separating courtyard, <i>are</i> the holy chambers where the priests who approach the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> shall eat the most holy offerings. There they shall lay the most holy offerings&#8212;the grain offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering&#8212;for the place <i>is</i> holy. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>When the priests enter them, they shall not go out of the holy <i>chamber</i> into the outer court; but there they shall leave their garments in which they minister, for they <i>are</i> holy. They shall put on other garments; then they may approach <i>that</i> which <i>is</i> for the people.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Outer Dimensions of the Temple</span></h3><p><span class="text Ezek-42-15"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Now when he had finished measuring the inner <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>temple, he brought me out through the gateway that faces toward the east, and measured it all around. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>He measured the east side with the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>measuring rod, five hundred rods by the measuring rod all around. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>He measured the north side, five hundred rods by the measuring rod all around. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>He measured the south side, five hundred rods by the measuring rod. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>He came around to the west side <i>and</i> measured five hundred rods by the measuring rod. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>He measured it on the four sides; it had a wall all around, five hundred <i>cubits</i> long and five hundred wide, to separate the holy areas from the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>common.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-21559a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 42:6">Ezekiel 42:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>narrowed</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-21568b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 42:15">Ezekiel 42:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>house</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-21569c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 42:16">Ezekiel 42:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>About 10.5 feet, <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Ezek.40.5" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=Ezek.40.5&amp;version=NKJV">Ezek. 40:5</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-21573d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 42:20">Ezekiel 42:20</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>profane</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
