<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Now, son of man, will you judge, will you judge the bloody city? Yes, show her all her abominations! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then say, &#8216;Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;The city sheds blood in her own midst, that her time may come; and she makes idols within herself to defile herself. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>You have become guilty by the blood which you have shed, and have defiled yourself with the idols which you have made. You have caused your days to draw near, and have come to <i>the end of</i> your years; therefore I have made you a reproach to the nations, and a mockery to all countries. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span><i>Those</i> near and <i>those</i> far from you will mock you as <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>infamous <i>and</i> full of tumult.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>&#8220;Look, the princes of Israel: each one has used his <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>power to shed blood in you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>In you they have made light of father and mother; in your midst they have oppressed the stranger; in you they have mistreated the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>fatherless and the widow. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>You have despised My holy things and profaned My Sabbaths. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>In you are men who slander to cause bloodshed; in you are those who eat on the mountains; in your midst they commit lewdness. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>In you men uncover their fathers&#8217; nakedness; in you they violate women who are set apart during their impurity. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>One commits abomination with his neighbor&#8217;s wife; another lewdly defiles his daughter-in-law; and another in you violates his sister, his father&#8217;s daughter. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>In you they take bribes to shed blood; you take usury and increase; you have made profit from your neighbors by extortion, and have forgotten Me,&#8221; says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8220;Behold, therefore, I beat My fists at the dishonest profit which you have made, and at the bloodshed which has been in your midst. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Can your heart endure, or can your hands remain strong, in the days when I shall deal with you? I, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, have spoken, and will do <i>it.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>I will scatter you among the nations, disperse you throughout the countries, and remove your filthiness completely from you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>You shall defile yourself in the sight of the nations; then you shall know that I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221; &#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Israel in the Furnace</span></h3><p><span class="text Ezek-22-17"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>The word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came to me, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to Me; they <i>are</i> all bronze, tin, iron, and lead, in the midst of a furnace; they have become dross from silver. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Therefore thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8216;Because you have all become dross, therefore behold, I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span><i>As men</i> gather silver, bronze, iron, lead, and tin into the midst of a furnace, to blow fire on it, to melt <i>it;</i> so I will gather <i>you</i> in My anger and in My fury, and I will leave <i>you there</i> and melt you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Yes, I will gather you and blow on you with the fire of My wrath, and you shall be melted in its midst. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>As silver is melted in the midst of a furnace, so shall you be melted in its midst; then you shall know that I, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, have poured out My fury on you.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <h3>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, say to her: &#8216;You <i>are</i> a land that is not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>cleansed or rained on in the day of indignation.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>The conspiracy of her <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>prophets in her midst is like a roaring lion tearing the prey; they have devoured <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>people; they have taken treasure and precious things; they have made many widows in her midst. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Her priests have <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>violated My law and profaned My holy things; they have not distinguished between the holy and unholy, nor have they made known <i>the difference</i> between the unclean and the clean; and they have hidden their eyes from My Sabbaths, so that I am profaned among them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Her princes in her midst <i>are</i> like wolves tearing the prey, to shed blood, to destroy <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>people, and to get dishonest gain. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Her prophets plastered them with untempered <i>mortar,</i> seeing false visions, and divining lies for them, saying, &#8216;Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>,&#8217; when the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had not spoken. </span>
