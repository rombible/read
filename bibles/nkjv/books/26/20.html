<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came to me, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel, and say to them, &#8216;Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;Have you come to inquire of Me? <i>As</i> I live,&#8221; says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>, &#8220;I will not be inquired of by you.&#8221; &#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Will you judge them, son of man, will you judge <i>them?</i> Then make known to them the abominations of their fathers.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8220;Say to them, &#8216;Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;On the day when I chose Israel and raised My hand in an oath to the descendants of the house of Jacob, and made Myself known to them in the land of Egypt, I raised My hand in an oath to them, saying, &#8216;I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>On that day I raised My hand in an oath to them, to bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, &#8216;flowing with milk and honey,&#8217; the glory of all lands. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then I said to them, &#8216;Each of you, throw away the abominations which are before his eyes, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt. I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But they rebelled against Me and would not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>obey Me. They did not all cast away the abominations which were before their eyes, nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I said, &#8216;I will pour out My fury on them and fulfill My anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But I acted for My name&#8217;s sake, that it should not be profaned before the Gentiles among whom they <i>were,</i> in whose sight I had made Myself known to them, to bring them out of the land of Egypt.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8220;Therefore I made them go out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And I gave them My statutes and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>showed them My judgments, &#8216;which, <i>if</i> a man does, he shall live by them.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Moreover I also gave them My Sabbaths, to be a sign between them and Me, that they might know that I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> who sanctifies them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Yet the house of Israel rebelled against Me in the wilderness; they did not walk in My statutes; they despised My judgments, &#8216;which, <i>if</i> a man does, he shall live by them&#8217;; and they greatly defiled My Sabbaths. Then I said I would pour out My fury on them in the wilderness, to consume them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But I acted for My name&#8217;s sake, that it should not be profaned before the Gentiles, in whose sight I had brought them out. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So I also raised My hand in an oath to them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given <i>them,</i> &#8216;flowing with milk and honey,&#8217; the glory of all lands, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>because they despised My judgments and did not walk in My statutes, but profaned My Sabbaths; for their heart went after their idols. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Nevertheless My eye spared them from destruction. I did not make an end of them in the wilderness.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>&#8220;But I said to their children in the wilderness, &#8216;Do not walk in the statutes of your fathers, nor observe their judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God: Walk in My statutes, keep My judgments, and do them; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>hallow My Sabbaths, and they will be a sign between Me and you, that you may know that I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God.&#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>&#8220;Notwithstanding, the children rebelled against Me; they did not walk in My statutes, and were not careful to observe My judgments, &#8216;which, <i>if</i> a man does, he shall live by them&#8217;; but they profaned My Sabbaths. Then I said I would pour out My fury on them and fulfill My anger against them in the wilderness. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Nevertheless I <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>withdrew My hand and acted for My name&#8217;s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the Gentiles, in whose sight I had brought them out. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Also I raised My hand in an oath to those in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the Gentiles and disperse them throughout the countries, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>because they had not executed My judgments, but had despised My statutes, profaned My Sabbaths, and their eyes were fixed on their fathers&#8217; idols.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>&#8220;Therefore I also gave them up to statutes <i>that were</i> not good, and judgments by which they could not live; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>and I pronounced them unclean because of their ritual gifts, in that they caused all <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>their firstborn to pass through <i>the fire,</i> that I might make them desolate and that they might know that I am the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221; &#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>&#8220;Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel, and say to them, &#8216;Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;In this too your fathers have blasphemed Me, by being unfaithful to Me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>When I brought them into the land <i>concerning</i> which I had raised My hand in an oath to give them, and they saw all the high hills and all the thick trees, there they offered their sacrifices and provoked Me with their offerings. There they also sent up their sweet aroma and poured out their drink offerings. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Then I said to them, &#8216;What <i>is</i> this <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>high place to which you go?&#8217; So its name is called <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>Bamah to this day.&#8221; &#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Therefore say to the house of Israel, &#8216;Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;Are you defiling yourselves in the manner of your fathers, and committing harlotry according to their abominations? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>For when you offer your gifts and make your sons pass through the fire, you defile yourselves with all your idols, even to this day. So shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? <i>As</i> I live,&#8221; says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>, &#8220;I will not be inquired of by you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>What you have in your mind shall never be, when you say, &#8216;We will be like the Gentiles, like the families in other countries, serving wood and stone.&#8217;</span></p> <h3>
