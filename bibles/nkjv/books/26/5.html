<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>You shall burn with fire one-third in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are finished; then you shall take one-third and strike around <i>it</i> with the sword, and one-third you shall scatter in the wind: I will draw out a sword after them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>You shall also take a small number of them and bind them in the edge of your <i>garment.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then take some of them again and throw them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire. From there a fire will go out into all the house of Israel.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8220;Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8216;This <i>is</i> Jerusalem; I have set her in the midst of the nations and the countries all around her. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>She has rebelled against My judgments by doing wickedness more than the nations, and against My statutes more than the countries that <i>are</i> all around her; for they have refused My judgments, and they have not walked in My statutes.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Therefore thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8216;Because you have <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>multiplied <i>disobedience</i> more than the nations that <i>are</i> all around you, have not walked in My statutes nor kept My judgments, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>nor even done according to the judgments of the nations that <i>are</i> all around you&#8217;&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>therefore thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8216;Indeed I, even I, <i>am</i> against you and will execute judgments in your midst in the sight of the nations. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And I will do among you what I have never done, and the like of which I will never do again, because of all your abominations. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Therefore fathers shall eat <i>their</i> sons in your midst, and sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments among you, and all of you who remain I will scatter to all the winds.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8216;Therefore, <i>as</i> I live,&#8217; says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>, &#8216;surely, because you have defiled My sanctuary with all your detestable things and with all your abominations, therefore I will also diminish <i>you;</i> My eye will not spare, nor will I have any pity. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>One-third of you shall die of the pestilence, and be consumed with famine in your midst; and one-third shall fall by the sword all around you; and I will scatter another third to all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8216;Thus shall My anger be spent, and I will cause My fury to rest upon them, and I will be avenged; and they shall know that I, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, have spoken <i>it</i> in My zeal, when I have spent My fury upon them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Moreover I will make you a waste and a reproach among the nations that <i>are</i> all around you, in the sight of all who pass by.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>&#8216;So <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>it shall be a reproach, a taunt, a lesson, and an astonishment to the nations that <i>are</i> all around you, when I execute judgments among you in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>When I send against them the terrible arrows of famine which shall be for destruction, which I will send to destroy you, I will increase the famine upon you and cut off your supply of bread. </span>
