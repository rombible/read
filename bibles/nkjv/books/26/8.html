<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then I looked, and there was a likeness, like the appearance of fire&#8212;from the appearance of His waist and downward, fire; and from His waist and upward, like the appearance of brightness, like the color of amber. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>He stretched out the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my hair; and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven, and brought me in visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the north gate of the inner <i>court,</i> where the seat of the image of jealousy <i>was,</i> which provokes<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span> to jealousy. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And behold, the glory of the God of Israel <i>was</i> there, like the vision that I saw in the plain.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then He said to me, &#8220;Son of man, lift your eyes now toward the north.&#8221; So I lifted my eyes toward the north, and there, north of the altar gate, was this image of jealousy in the entrance.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Furthermore He said to me, &#8220;Son of man, do you see what they are doing, the great abominations that the house of Israel commits here, to make Me go far away from My sanctuary? Now turn again, you will see greater abominations.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So He brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, there was a hole in the wall. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then He said to me, &#8220;Son of man, dig into the wall&#8221;; and when I dug into the wall, there was a door.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And He said to me, &#8220;Go in, and see the wicked abominations which they are doing there.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So I went in and saw, and there&#8212;every sort of creeping thing, abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>portrayed all around on the walls. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And there stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, and in their midst stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan. Each man had a censer in his hand, and a thick cloud of incense went up. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then He said to me, &#8220;Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the room of his idols? For they say, &#8216;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> does not see us, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has forsaken the land.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And He said to me, &#8220;Turn again, <i>and</i> you will see greater abominations that they are doing.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So He brought me to the door of the north gate of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s house; and to my dismay, women were sitting there weeping for <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Tammuz.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then He said to me, &#8220;Have you seen <i>this,</i> O son of man? Turn again, you will see greater abominations than these.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So He brought me into the inner court of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s house; and there, at the door of the temple of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, between the porch and the altar, <i>were</i> about twenty-five men with their backs toward the temple of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and their faces toward the east, and they were worshiping the sun toward the east.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And He said to me, &#8220;Have you seen <i>this,</i> O son of man? Is it a trivial thing to the house of Judah to commit the abominations which they commit here? For they have filled the land with violence; then they have returned to provoke Me to anger. Indeed they put the branch to their nose. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Therefore I also will act in fury. My eye will not spare nor will I have pity; and though they cry in My ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them.&#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-20608a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 8:3">Ezekiel 8:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Arouses the <span class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s jealousy</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-20615b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 8:10">Ezekiel 8:10</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>carved</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-20619c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 8:14">Ezekiel 8:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'>A Sumerian fertility god similar to the Gr. god Adonis</span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
