<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and say, &#8216;Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span> to Jerusalem: &#8220;Your <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>birth and your nativity <i>are</i> from the land of Canaan; your father <i>was</i> an Amorite and your mother a Hittite. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span><i>As for</i> your nativity, on the day you were born your navel cord was not cut, nor were you washed in water to cleanse <i>you;</i> you were not rubbed with salt nor wrapped in swaddling cloths. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>No eye pitied you, to do any of these things for you, to have compassion on you; but you were thrown out into the open field, when you yourself were <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>loathed on the day you were born.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>&#8220;And when I passed by you and saw you struggling in your own blood, I said to you in your blood, &#8216;Live!&#8217; Yes, I said to you in your blood, &#8216;Live!&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>I made you <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>thrive like a plant in the field; and you grew, matured, and became very beautiful. <i>Your</i> breasts were formed, your hair grew, but you <i>were</i> naked and bare.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8220;When I passed by you again and looked upon you, indeed your time <i>was</i> the time of love; so I spread <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>My wing over you and covered your nakedness. Yes, I swore an oath to you and entered into a covenant with you, and you became Mine,&#8221; says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;Then I washed you in water; yes, I thoroughly washed off your blood, and I anointed you with oil. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>I clothed you in embroidered cloth and gave you sandals of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>badger skin; I clothed you with fine linen and covered you with silk. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>I adorned you with ornaments, put bracelets on your wrists, and a chain on your neck. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And I put a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>jewel in your nose, earrings in your ears, and a beautiful crown on your head. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Thus you were adorned with gold and silver, and your clothing <i>was of</i> fine linen, silk, and embroidered cloth. You ate <i>pastry of</i> fine flour, honey, and oil. You were exceedingly beautiful, and succeeded to royalty. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Your fame went out among the nations because of your beauty, for it <i>was</i> perfect through My splendor which I had bestowed on you,&#8221; says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>.</span></p> <h3>
Jerusalem&#8217;s Harlotry</span></h3><p><span class="text Ezek-16-15"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>&#8220;But you trusted in your own beauty, played the harlot because of your fame, and poured out your harlotry on everyone passing by who <i>would have</i> it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>You took some of your garments and adorned multicolored <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>high places for yourself, and played the harlot on them. <i>Such</i> things should not happen, nor be. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>You have also taken your beautiful jewelry from My gold and My silver, which I had given you, and made for yourself male images and played the harlot with them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>You took your embroidered garments and covered them, and you set My oil and My incense before them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Also My food which I gave you&#8212;the pastry of fine flour, oil, and honey <i>which</i> I fed you&#8212;you set it before them as <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>sweet incense; and <i>so</i> it was,&#8221; says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>&#8220;Moreover you took your sons and your daughters, whom you bore to Me, and these you sacrificed to them to be devoured. <i>Were</i> your <i>acts</i> of harlotry a small matter, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>that you have slain My children and offered them up to them by causing them to pass through <i>the</i> <i>fire?</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And in all your abominations and acts of harlotry you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, struggling in your blood.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>&#8220;Then it was so, after all your wickedness&#8212;&#8216;Woe, woe to you!&#8217; says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span><i>that</i> you also built for yourself a shrine, and made a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>high place for yourself in every street. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>You built your high places at the head of every road, and made your beauty to be abhorred. You offered yourself to everyone who passed by, and multiplied your acts of harlotry. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>You also committed harlotry with the Egyptians, your very fleshly neighbors, and increased your acts of harlotry to provoke Me to anger.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>&#8220;Behold, therefore, I stretched out My hand against you, diminished your <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>allotment, and gave you up to the will of those who hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, who were ashamed of your lewd behavior. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>You also played the harlot with the Assyrians, because you were insatiable; indeed you played the harlot with them and still were not satisfied. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Moreover you multiplied your acts of harlotry as far as the land of the trader, Chaldea; and even then you were not satisfied.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>&#8220;How degenerate is your heart!&#8221; says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>, &#8220;seeing you do all these <i>things,</i> the deeds of a brazen harlot.</span></p> <h3>
Jerusalem&#8217;s Adultery</span></h3><p><span class="text Ezek-16-31"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>&#8220;You erected your shrine at the head of every road, and built your <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span>high place in every street. Yet you were not like a harlot, because you scorned payment. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span><i>You are</i> an adulterous wife, <i>who</i> takes strangers instead of her husband. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Men make payment to all harlots, but you made your payments to all your lovers, and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[l]</a></span>hired them to come to you from all around for your harlotry. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>You are the opposite of <i>other</i> women in your harlotry, because no one solicited you to be a harlot. In that you gave payment but no payment was given you, therefore you are the opposite.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Jerusalem&#8217;s Lovers Will Abuse Her</span></h3><p><span class="text Ezek-16-35"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>&#8216;Now then, O harlot, hear the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;Because your filthiness was poured out and your nakedness uncovered in your harlotry with your lovers, and with all your abominable idols, and because of the blood of your children which you gave to them, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>surely, therefore, I will gather all your lovers with whom you took pleasure, all those you loved, <i>and</i> all those you hated; I will gather them from all around against you and will uncover your nakedness to them, that they may see all your nakedness. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>And I will judge you as women who break wedlock or shed blood are judged; I will bring blood upon you in fury and jealousy. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>I will also give you into their hand, and they shall throw down your shrines and break down your <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[m]</a></span>high places. They shall also strip you of your clothes, take your beautiful jewelry, and leave you naked and bare.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>&#8220;They shall also bring up an assembly against you, and they shall stone you with stones and thrust you through with their swords. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>They shall burn your houses with fire, and execute judgments on you in the sight of many women; and I will make you cease playing the harlot, and you shall no longer hire lovers. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>So I will lay to rest My fury toward you, and My jealousy shall depart from you. I will be quiet, and be angry no more. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>Because you did not remember the days of your youth, but <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[n]</a></span>agitated Me with all these <i>things,</i> surely I will also recompense your <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[o]</a></span>deeds on <i>your own</i> head,&#8221; says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>. &#8220;And you shall not commit lewdness in addition to all your abominations.</span></p> <h3>
More Wicked than Samaria and Sodom</span></h3><p><span class="text Ezek-16-44"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>&#8220;Indeed everyone who quotes proverbs will use <i>this</i> proverb against you: &#8216;Like mother, like daughter!&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>You <i>are</i> your mother&#8217;s daughter, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[p]</a></span>loathing husband and children; and you <i>are</i> the sister of your sisters, who loathed their husbands and children; your mother <i>was</i> a Hittite and your father an Amorite.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span>&#8220;Your elder sister <i>is</i> Samaria, who dwells with her daughters to the north of you; and your younger sister, who dwells to the south of you, <i>is</i> Sodom and her daughters. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-47.htm"><b>47</b></a></span>You did not walk in their ways nor act according to their abominations; but, as <i>if that were</i> too little, you became more corrupt than they in all your ways.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-48.htm"><b>48</b></a></span>&#8220;<i>As</i> I live,&#8221; says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>, &#8220;neither your sister Sodom nor her daughters have done as you and your daughters have done. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-49.htm"><b>49</b></a></span>Look, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom: She and her daughter had pride, fullness of food, and abundance of idleness; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-50.htm"><b>50</b></a></span>And they were haughty and committed abomination before Me; therefore I took them away as <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[q]</a></span>I saw <i>fit.</i></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-51.htm"><b>51</b></a></span>&#8220;Samaria did not commit half of your sins; but you have multiplied your abominations more than they, and have justified your sisters by all the abominations which you have done. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-52.htm"><b>52</b></a></span>You who judged your sisters, bear your own shame also, because the sins which you committed were more abominable than theirs; they are more righteous than you. Yes, be disgraced also, and bear your own shame, because you justified your sisters.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-53.htm"><b>53</b></a></span>&#8220;When I bring back their captives, the captives of Sodom and her daughters, and the captives of Samaria and her daughters, then <i>I will also bring back</i> the captives of your captivity among them, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-54.htm"><b>54</b></a></span>that you may bear your own shame and be disgraced by all that you did when you comforted them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-55.htm"><b>55</b></a></span>When your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, return to their former state, and Samaria and her daughters return to their former state, then you and your daughters will return to your former state. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-56.htm"><b>56</b></a></span>For your sister Sodom was not a byword in your mouth in the days of your pride, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-57.htm"><b>57</b></a></span>before your wickedness was uncovered. It was like the time of the reproach of the daughters of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[r]</a></span>Syria and all <i>those</i> around her, and of the daughters of the Philistines, who despise you everywhere. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-58.htm"><b>58</b></a></span>You have paid for your lewdness and your abominations,&#8221; says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-59.htm"><b>59</b></a></span>For thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;I will deal with you as you have done, who despised the oath by breaking the covenant.</span></p> <h3>
