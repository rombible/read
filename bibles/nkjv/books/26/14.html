<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came to me, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their hearts, and put before them that which causes them to stumble into iniquity. Should I let Myself be inquired of at all by them?</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8220;Therefore speak to them, and say to them, &#8216;Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;Everyone of the house of Israel who sets up his idols in his heart, and puts before him what causes him to stumble into iniquity, and then comes to the prophet, I the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will answer him who comes, according to the multitude of his idols, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>that I may seize the house of Israel by their heart, because they are all estranged from Me by their idols.&#8221; &#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>&#8220;Therefore say to the house of Israel, &#8216;Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;Repent, turn away from your idols, and turn your faces away from all your abominations. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For anyone of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who dwell in Israel, who separates himself from Me and sets up his idols in his heart and puts before him what causes him to stumble into iniquity, then comes to a prophet to inquire of him concerning Me, I the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will answer him by Myself. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>I will set My face against that man and make him a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of My people.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;And if the prophet is induced to speak anything, I the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> have induced that prophet, and I will stretch out My hand against him and destroy him from among My people Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And they shall bear their iniquity; the punishment of the prophet shall be the same as the punishment of the one who inquired, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>that the house of Israel may no longer stray from Me, nor be profaned anymore with all their transgressions, but that they may be My people and I may be their God,&#8221; says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Judgment on Persistent Unfaithfulness</span></h3><p><span class="text Ezek-14-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>The word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came again to me, saying: </span>
