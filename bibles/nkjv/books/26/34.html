<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy and say to them, &#8216;Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span> to the shepherds: &#8220;Woe to the shepherds of Israel who feed themselves! Should not the shepherds feed the flocks? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>You eat the fat and clothe yourselves with the wool; you slaughter the fatlings, <i>but</i> you do not feed the flock. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>The weak you have not strengthened, nor have you healed those who were sick, nor bound up the broken, nor brought back what was driven away, nor sought what was lost; but with force and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>cruelty you have ruled them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So they were scattered because <i>there was</i> no shepherd; and they became food for all the beasts of the field when they were scattered. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and on every high hill; yes, My flock was scattered over the whole face of the earth, and no one was seeking or searching <i>for them.</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8216;Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8220;<i>As</i> I live,&#8221; says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>, &#8220;surely because My flock became a prey, and My flock became food for every beast of the field, because <i>there was</i> no shepherd, nor did My shepherds search for My flock, but the shepherds fed themselves and did not feed My flock&#8221;&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>therefore, O shepherds, hear the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;Behold, I <i>am</i> against the shepherds, and I will require My flock at their hand; I will cause them to cease feeding the sheep, and the shepherds shall feed themselves no more; for I will deliver My flock from their mouths, that they may no longer be food for them.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
God, the True Shepherd</span></h3><p><span class="text Ezek-34-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8216;For thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;Indeed I Myself will search for My sheep and seek them out. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>As a shepherd seeks out his flock on the day he is among his scattered sheep, so will I seek out My sheep and deliver them from all the places where they were scattered on a cloudy and dark day. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries, and will bring them to their own land; I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>in the valleys and in all the inhabited places of the country. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>I will feed them in good pasture, and their fold shall be on the high mountains of Israel. There they shall lie down in a good fold and feed in rich pasture on the mountains of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>I will feed My flock, and I will make them lie down,&#8221; says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>&#8220;I will seek what was lost and bring back what was driven away, bind up the broken and strengthen what was sick; but I will destroy the fat and the strong, and feed them in judgment.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>&#8216;And <i>as for</i> you, O My flock, thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;Behold, I shall judge between sheep and sheep, between rams and goats. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span><i>Is it</i> too little for you to have eaten up the good pasture, that you must tread down with your feet the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>residue of your pasture&#8212;and to have drunk of the clear waters, that you must foul the residue with your feet? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And <i>as for</i> My flock, they eat what you have trampled with your feet, and they drink what you have fouled with your feet.&#8221;</span></p> <p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Because you have pushed with side and shoulder, butted all the weak ones with your horns, and scattered them abroad, </span>
