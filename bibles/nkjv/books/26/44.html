<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to me, &#8220;This gate shall be shut; it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter by it, because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel has entered by it; therefore it shall be shut. </span>

Those Admitted to the Temple</span></h3><p><span class="text Ezek-44-4"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Also He brought me by way of the north gate to the front of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>temple; so I looked, and behold, the glory of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> filled the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; and I fell on my face. </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>&#8220;Now say to the rebellious, to the house of Israel, &#8216;Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;O house of Israel, let Us have no more of all your abominations. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>When you brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in My sanctuary to defile it&#8212;My house&#8212;and when you offered My food, the fat and the blood, then they broke My covenant because of all your abominations. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And you have not kept charge of My holy things, but you have set <i>others</i> to keep charge of My sanctuary for you.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart or uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter My sanctuary, including any foreigner who <i>is</i> among the children of Israel.</span></p> <h3>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Yet they shall be ministers in My sanctuary, <i>as</i> gatekeepers of the house and ministers of the house; they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister to them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Because they ministered to them before their idols and caused<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> the house of Israel to fall into iniquity, therefore I have raised My hand in an oath against them,&#8221; says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>, &#8220;that they shall bear their iniquity. </span>
