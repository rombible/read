<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east. His voice <i>was</i> like the sound of many waters; and the earth shone with His glory. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span><i>It was</i> like the appearance of the vision which I saw&#8212;like the vision which I saw when <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>I came to destroy the city.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>When they set their threshold by My threshold, and their doorpost by My doorpost, with a wall between them and Me, they defiled My holy name by the abominations which they committed; therefore I have consumed them in My anger. </span>

Dimensions of the Altar</span></h3><p><span class="text Ezek-43-13"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8220;These are the measurements of the altar in cubits (the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>cubit <i>is</i> one cubit and a handbreadth): the base one cubit high and one cubit wide, with a rim all around its edge of one span.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then you shall also take the bull of the sin offering, and burn it in the appointed place of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>temple, outside the sanctuary. </span>
