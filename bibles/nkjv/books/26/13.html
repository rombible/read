<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who prophesy, and say to those who prophesy out of their own heart,<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span> &#8216;Hear the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>!&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;Woe to the foolish prophets, who follow their own spirit and have seen <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>nothing! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>O Israel, your prophets are like foxes in the deserts. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>You have not gone up into the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>gaps to build a wall for the house of Israel to stand in battle on the day of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>They have envisioned futility and false divination, saying, &#8216;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>!&#8217; But the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has not sent them; yet they hope that the word may <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>be confirmed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Have you not seen a futile vision, and have you not spoken false divination? You say, &#8216;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> says,&#8217; but I have not spoken.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Therefore thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;Because you have spoken nonsense and envisioned lies, therefore I <i>am</i> indeed against you,&#8221; says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;My hand will be against the prophets who envision futility and who divine lies; they shall not be in the assembly of My people, nor be written in the record of the house of Israel, nor shall they enter into the land of Israel. Then you shall know that I <i>am</i> the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8220;Because, indeed, because they have seduced My people, saying, &#8216;Peace!&#8217; when <i>there is</i> no peace&#8212;and one builds a wall, and they plaster<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span> it with untempered <i>mortar</i>&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>say to those who plaster <i>it</i> with untempered <i>mortar,</i> that it will fall. There will be flooding rain, and you, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall tear <i>it</i> down. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Surely, when the wall has fallen, will it not be said to you, &#8216;Where <i>is</i> the mortar with which you plastered <i>it?</i>&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Therefore thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;I will cause a stormy wind to break forth in My fury; and there shall be a flooding rain in My anger, and great hailstones in fury to consume <i>it.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So I will break down the wall you have plastered with untempered <i>mortar,</i> and bring it down to the ground, so that its foundation will be uncovered; it will fall, and you shall be consumed in the midst of it. Then you shall know that I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>&#8220;Thus will I accomplish My wrath on the wall and on those who have plastered it with untempered <i>mortar;</i> and I will say to you, &#8216;The wall <i>is</i> no <i>more,</i> nor those who plastered it, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span><i>that is,</i> the prophets of Israel who prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and who see visions of peace for her when <i>there is</i> no peace,&#8217; &#8221; says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>&#8220;Likewise, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people, who prophesy out of their own <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>heart; prophesy against them, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>and say, &#8216;Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;Woe to the <i>women</i> who sew <i>magic</i> charms <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>on their sleeves and make veils for the heads of people of every height to hunt souls! Will you hunt the souls of My people, and keep yourselves alive? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And will you profane Me among My people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, killing people who should not die, and keeping people alive who should not live, by your lying to My people who listen to lies?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>&#8216;Therefore thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;Behold, I <i>am</i> against your <i>magic</i> charms by which you hunt souls there like <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>birds. I will tear them from your arms, and let the souls go, the souls you hunt like birds. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>I will also tear off your veils and deliver My people out of your hand, and they shall no longer be as prey in your hand.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>&#8220;Because with lies you have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not made sad; and you have strengthened the hands of the wicked, so that he does not turn from his wicked way to save his life. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Therefore you shall no longer envision futility nor practice divination; for I will deliver My people out of your hand, and you shall know that I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221; &#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-20711a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 13:2">Ezekiel 13:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Inspiration</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-20712b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 13:3">Ezekiel 13:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>No vision</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-20714c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 13:5">Ezekiel 13:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>breaches</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-20715d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 13:6">Ezekiel 13:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Come true</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-20719e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 13:10">Ezekiel 13:10</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>whitewash</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-20726f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 13:17">Ezekiel 13:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Inspiration</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-20727g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 13:18">Ezekiel 13:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>over all the joints of My hands;</i> Vg. <i>under every elbow;</i> LXX, Tg. <i>on all elbows of the hands</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-20729h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 13:20">Ezekiel 13:20</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>flying ones</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
