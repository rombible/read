<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>In the visions of God He took me into the land of Israel and set me on a very high mountain; on it toward the south <i>was</i> something like the structure of a city. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>He took me there, and behold, <i>there was</i> a man whose appearance <i>was</i> like the appearance of bronze. He had a line of flax and a measuring rod in his hand, and he stood in the gateway.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And the man said to me, &#8220;Son of man, look with your eyes and hear with your ears, and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>fix your mind on everything I show you; for you <i>were</i> brought here so that I might show <i>them</i> to you. Declare to the house of Israel everything you see.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now there was a wall all around the outside of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>temple. In the man&#8217;s hand was a measuring rod six <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>cubits <i>long, each being a</i> cubit and a handbreadth; and he measured the width of the wall structure, one rod; and the height, one rod.</span></p> <h3>
The Eastern Gateway of the Temple</span></h3><p><span class="text Ezek-40-6"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then he went to the gateway which faced east; and he went up its stairs and measured the threshold of the gateway, <i>which was</i> one rod wide, and the other threshold <i>was</i> one rod wide. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Each gate chamber <i>was</i> one rod long and one rod wide; between the gate chambers <i>was a space of</i> five cubits; and the threshold of the gateway by the vestibule of the inside gate <i>was</i> one rod. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>He also measured the vestibule of the inside gate, one rod. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then he measured the vestibule of the gateway, eight cubits; and the gateposts, two cubits. The vestibule of the gate <i>was</i> on the inside. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>In the eastern gateway <i>were</i> three gate chambers on one side and three on the other; the three <i>were</i> all the same size; also the gateposts were of the same size on this side and that side.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>He measured the width of the entrance to the gateway, ten cubits; <i>and</i> the length of the gate, thirteen cubits. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span><i>There was</i> a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>space in front of the gate chambers, one cubit <i>on this side</i> and one cubit on that side; the gate chambers <i>were</i> six cubits on this side and six cubits on that side. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then he measured the gateway from the roof of <i>one</i> gate chamber to the roof of the other; the width <i>was</i> twenty-five cubits, as door faces door. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>He measured the gateposts, sixty cubits high, and the court all around the gateway <i>extended</i> to the gatepost. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span><i>From</i> the front of the entrance gate to the front of the vestibule of the inner gate <i>was</i> fifty cubits. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span><i>There were</i> beveled window <i>frames</i> in the gate chambers and in their intervening archways on the inside of the gateway all around, and likewise in the vestibules. <i>There were</i> windows all around on the inside.

The Outer Court</span></h3><p><span class="text Ezek-40-17"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then he brought me into the outer court; and <i>there were</i> chambers and a pavement made all around the court; thirty chambers faced the pavement. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>The pavement was by the side of the gateways, corresponding to the length of the gateways; <i>this was</i> the lower pavement. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then he measured the width from the front of the lower gateway to the front of the inner court exterior, one hundred cubits toward the east and the north.</span></p> <h3>
The Northern Gateway</span></h3><p><span class="text Ezek-40-20"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>On the outer court was also a gateway facing north, and he measured its length and its width. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Its gate chambers, three on this side and three on that side, its gateposts and its archways, had the same measurements as the first gate; its length <i>was</i> fifty cubits and its width twenty-five cubits. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Its windows and those of its archways, and also its palm trees, <i>had</i> the same measurements as the gateway facing east; it was ascended by seven steps, and its archway <i>was</i> in front of it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>A gate of the inner court was opposite the northern gateway, just as the eastern <i>gateway;</i> and he measured from gateway to gateway, one hundred cubits.</span></p> <h3>
The Southern Gateway</span></h3><p><span class="text Ezek-40-24"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>After that he brought me toward the south, and there a gateway was facing south; and he measured its gateposts and archways according to these same measurements. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span><i>There were</i> windows in it and in its archways all around like those windows; its length <i>was</i> fifty cubits and its width twenty-five cubits. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Seven steps led up to it, and its archway <i>was</i> in front of them; and it had palm trees on its gateposts, one on this side and one on that side. </span>
