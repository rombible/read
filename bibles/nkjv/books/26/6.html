<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and say, &#8216;O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>! Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span> to the mountains, to the hills, to the ravines, and to the valleys: &#8220;Indeed I, <i>even</i> I, will bring a sword against you, and I will destroy your <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>high places. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then your altars shall be desolate, your incense altars shall be broken, and I will cast down your slain <i>men</i> before your idols. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And I will lay the corpses of the children of Israel before their idols, and I will scatter your bones all around your altars. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>In all your dwelling places the cities shall be laid waste, and the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>high places shall be desolate, so that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, your idols may be broken and made to cease, your incense altars may be cut down, and your works may be abolished. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>The slain shall fall in your midst, and you shall know that I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8220;Yet I will leave a remnant, so that you may have <i>some</i> who escape the sword among the nations, when you are scattered through the countries. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then those of you who escape will remember Me among the nations where they are carried captive, because I was crushed by their adulterous heart which has departed from Me, and by their eyes which play the harlot after their idols; they will loathe themselves for the evils which they committed in all their abominations. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And they shall know that I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; I have not said in vain that I would bring this calamity upon them.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8216;Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;Pound<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> your fists and stamp your feet, and say, &#8216;Alas, for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel! For they shall fall by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>He who is far off shall die by the pestilence, he who is near shall fall by the sword, and he who remains and is besieged shall die by the famine. Thus will I spend My fury upon them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then you shall know that I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, when their slain are among their idols all around their altars, on every high hill, on all the mountaintops, under every green tree, and under every thick oak, wherever they offered sweet incense to all their idols. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So I will stretch out My hand against them and make the land desolate, yes, more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblah, in all their dwelling places. Then they shall know that I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8217; &#8221; &#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-20567a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 6:3">Ezekiel 6:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Places for pagan worship</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-20570b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 6:6">Ezekiel 6:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Places for pagan worship</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-20575c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 6:11">Ezekiel 6:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Strike your hands</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
