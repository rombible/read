<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So I opened my mouth, and He caused me to eat that scroll.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And He said to me, &#8220;Son of man, feed your belly, and fill your stomach with this scroll that I give you.&#8221; So I ate, and it was in my mouth like honey in sweetness.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then He said to me: &#8220;Son of man, go to the house of Israel and speak with My words to them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For you <i>are</i> not sent to a people of unfamiliar speech and of hard language, <i>but</i> to the house of Israel, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>not to many people of unfamiliar speech and of hard language, whose words you cannot understand. Surely, had I sent you to them, they would have listened to you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But the house of Israel will not listen to you, because they will not listen to Me; for all the house of Israel <i>are</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>impudent and hard-hearted. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Behold, I have made your face strong against their faces, and your forehead strong against their foreheads. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Like adamant stone, harder than flint, I have made your forehead; do not be afraid of them, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they <i>are</i> a rebellious house.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Moreover He said to me: &#8220;Son of man, receive into your heart all My words that I speak to you, and hear with your ears. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And go, get to the captives, to the children of your people, and speak to them and tell them, &#8216;Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>,&#8217; whether they hear, or whether they refuse.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me a great thunderous voice: &#8220;Blessed <i>is</i> the glory of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> from His place!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span><i>I</i> also <i>heard</i> the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels beside them, and a great thunderous noise. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So the Spirit lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>heat of my spirit; but the hand of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was strong upon me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then I came to the captives at Tel Abib, who dwelt by the River Chebar; and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.</span></p> <h3>
Ezekiel Is a Watchman</span></h3><p><span class="text Ezek-3-16"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Now it came to pass at the end of seven days that the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came to me, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel; therefore hear a word from My mouth, and give them warning from Me: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>When I say to the wicked, &#8216;You shall surely die,&#8217; and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life, that same wicked <i>man</i> shall die in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at your hand. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Yet, if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>&#8220;Again, when a righteous <i>man</i> turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he shall die; because you did not give him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he has done shall not be remembered; but his blood I will require at your hand. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Nevertheless if you warn the righteous <i>man</i> that the righteous should not sin, and he does not sin, he shall surely live because he took warning; also you will have delivered your soul.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then the hand of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was upon me there, and He said to me, &#8220;Arise, go out into the plain, and there I shall talk with you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>So I arose and went out into the plain, and behold, the glory of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> stood there, like the glory which I saw by the River Chebar; and I fell on my face. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then the Spirit entered me and set me on my feet, and spoke with me and said to me: &#8220;Go, shut yourself inside your house. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And you, O son of man, surely they will put ropes on you and bind you with them, so that you cannot go out among them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>I will make your tongue cling to the roof of your mouth, so that you shall be mute and not be <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>one to rebuke them, for they <i>are</i> a rebellious house. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall say to them, &#8216;Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>.&#8217; He who hears, let him hear; and he who refuses, let him refuse; for they <i>are</i> a rebellious house.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-20510a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 3:7">Ezekiel 3:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>strong of forehead</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-20517b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 3:14">Ezekiel 3:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>anger</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-20529c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 3:26">Ezekiel 3:26</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>one who rebukes</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
