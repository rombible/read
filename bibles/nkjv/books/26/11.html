<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And He said to me: &#8220;Son of man, these <i>are</i> the men who devise iniquity and give wicked <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>counsel in this city, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>who say, &#8216;<i>The time is</i> not near to build houses; this <i>city is</i> the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>caldron, and we <i>are</i> the meat.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then the Spirit of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> fell upon me, and said to me, &#8220;Speak! &#8216;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8220;Thus you have said, O house of Israel; for I know the things that come into your mind. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>You have multiplied your slain in this city, and you have filled its streets with the slain.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Therefore thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;Your slain whom you have laid in its midst, they <i>are</i> the meat, and this <i>city is</i> the caldron; but I shall bring you out of the midst of it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>You have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you,&#8221; says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;And I will bring you out of its midst, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and execute judgments on you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>You shall fall by the sword. I will judge you at the border of Israel. Then you shall know that I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>This <i>city</i> shall not be your <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>caldron, nor shall you be the meat in its midst. I will judge you at the border of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And you shall know that I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; for you have not walked in My statutes nor executed My judgments, but have done according to the customs of the Gentiles which <i>are</i> all around you.&#8221; &#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Now it happened, while I was prophesying, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then I fell on my face and cried with a loud voice, and said, &#8220;Ah, Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>!

God Will Restore Israel</span></h3><p><span class="text Ezek-11-14"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Again the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came to me, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, your brethren, your relatives, your countrymen, and all the house of Israel in its entirety, <i>are</i> those about whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, &#8216;Get far away from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; this land has been given to us as a possession.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Therefore say, &#8216;Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;Although I have cast them far off among the Gentiles, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet I shall be a little <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>sanctuary for them in the countries where they have gone.&#8221; &#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Therefore say, &#8216;Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;I will gather you from the peoples, assemble you from the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.&#8221; &#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And they will go there, and they will take away all its detestable things and all its abominations from there. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>them, and take the stony heart out of their flesh, and give them a heart of flesh, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>that they may walk in My statutes and keep My judgments and do them; and they shall be My people, and I will be their God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>But <i>as for those</i> whose hearts follow the desire for their detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their deeds on their own heads,&#8221; says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So the cherubim lifted up their wings, with the wheels beside them, and the glory of the God of Israel <i>was</i> high above them. </span>
