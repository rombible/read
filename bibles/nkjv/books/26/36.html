<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;Because the enemy has said of you, &#8216;Aha! The <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>ancient heights have become our possession,&#8217; &#8221; &#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>therefore prophesy, and say, &#8216;Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;Because they made <i>you</i> desolate and swallowed you up on every side, so that you became the possession of the rest of the nations, and you are taken up by the lips of talkers and slandered by the people&#8221;&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>therefore, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>! Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span> to the mountains, the hills, the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>rivers, the valleys, the desolate wastes, and the cities that have been forsaken, which became plunder and mockery to the rest of the nations all around&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>therefore thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;Surely I have spoken in My burning jealousy against the rest of the nations and against all Edom, who gave My land to themselves as a possession, with wholehearted joy <i>and</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>spiteful minds, in order to plunder its open country.&#8221; &#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>&#8220;Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains, the hills, the rivers, and the valleys, &#8216;Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;Behold, I have spoken in My jealousy and My fury, because you have borne the shame of the nations.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Therefore thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;I have raised My hand in an oath that surely the nations that <i>are</i> around you shall bear their own shame. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But you, O mountains of Israel, you shall shoot forth your branches and yield your fruit to My people Israel, for they are about to come. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For indeed I <i>am</i> for you, and I will turn to you, and you shall be tilled and sown. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, all of it; and the cities shall be inhabited and the ruins rebuilt. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall increase and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>bear young; I will make you inhabited as in former times, and do better <i>for you</i> than at your beginnings.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Yes, I will cause men to walk on you, My people Israel; they shall take possession of you, and you shall be their inheritance; no more shall you bereave them <i>of children.</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8216;Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;Because they say to you, &#8216;You devour men and bereave your nation <i>of children,</i>&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>therefore you shall devour men no more, nor bereave your nation anymore,&#8221; says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>&#8220;Nor will I let you hear the taunts of the nations anymore, nor bear the reproach of the peoples anymore, nor shall you cause your nation to stumble anymore,&#8221; says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <h3>
The Renewal of Israel</span></h3><p><span class="text Ezek-36-16"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Moreover the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came to me, saying: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their own ways and deeds; to Me their way was like the uncleanness of a woman in her customary impurity. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Therefore I poured out My fury on them for the blood they had shed on the land, and for their idols <i>with which</i> they had defiled it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>So I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed throughout the countries; I judged them according to their ways and their deeds. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>When they came to the nations, wherever they went, they profaned My holy name&#8212;when they said of them, &#8216;These <i>are</i> the people of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, <i>and</i> yet they have gone out of His land.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>But I had concern for My holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations wherever they went.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>&#8220;Therefore say to the house of Israel, &#8216;Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;I do not do <i>this</i> for your sake, O house of Israel, but for My holy name&#8217;s sake, which you have profaned among the nations wherever you went. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And I will sanctify My great name, which has been profaned among the nations, which you have profaned in their midst; and the nations shall know that I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>,&#8221; says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>, &#8220;when I am hallowed in you before their eyes. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>For I will take you from among the nations, gather you out of all countries, and bring you into your own land. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean; I will cleanse you from all your filthiness and from all your idols. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will take the heart of stone out of your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you will keep My judgments and do <i>them.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then you shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; you shall be My people, and I will be your God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>I will deliver you from all your uncleannesses. I will call for the grain and multiply it, and bring no famine upon you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And I will multiply the fruit of your trees and the increase of your fields, so that you need never again bear the reproach of famine among the nations. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Then you will remember your evil ways and your deeds that <i>were</i> not good; and you will <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>loathe yourselves in your own sight, for your iniquities and your abominations. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Not for your sake do I do <i>this,</i>&#8221; says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>, &#8220;let it be known to you. Be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house of Israel!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>&#8216;Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;On the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will also enable <i>you</i> to dwell in the cities, and the ruins shall be rebuilt. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>The desolate land shall be tilled instead of lying desolate in the sight of all who pass by. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>So they will say, &#8216;This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden; and the wasted, desolate, and ruined cities <i>are now</i> fortified <i>and</i> inhabited.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Then the nations which are left all around you shall know that I, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, have rebuilt the ruined places <i>and</i> planted what was desolate. I, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, have spoken <i>it,</i> and I will do <i>it.</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>&#8216;Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;I will also let the house of Israel inquire of Me to do this for them: I will increase their men like a flock. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>Like a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>flock <i>offered as</i> holy <i>sacrifices,</i> like the flock at Jerusalem on its <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>feast days, so shall the ruined cities be filled with flocks of men.
