<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, set your face against the Ammonites, and prophesy against them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Say to the Ammonites, &#8216;Hear the word of the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>! Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;Because you said, &#8216;Aha!&#8217; against My sanctuary when it was profaned, and against the land of Israel when it was desolate, and against the house of Judah when they went into captivity, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>indeed, therefore, I will deliver you as a possession to the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>men of the East, and they shall set their encampments among you and make their dwellings among you; they shall eat your fruit, and they shall drink your milk. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels and Ammon a resting place for flocks. Then you shall know that I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>&#8216;For thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;Because you clapped <i>your</i> hands, stamped your feet, and rejoiced in heart with all your disdain for the land of Israel, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>indeed, therefore, I will stretch out My hand against you, and give you as plunder to the nations; I will cut you off from the peoples, and I will cause you to perish from the countries; I will destroy you, and you shall know that I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Proclamation Against Moab</span></h3><p><span class="text Ezek-25-8"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8216;Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;Because Moab and Seir say, &#8216;Look! The house of Judah <i>is</i> like all the nations,&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>therefore, behold, I will clear the territory of Moab of cities, of the cities on its frontier, the glory of the country, Beth Jeshimoth, Baal Meon, and Kirjathaim. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>To the men of the East I will give it as a possession, together with the Ammonites, that the Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And I will execute judgments upon Moab, and they shall know that I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Proclamation Against Edom</span></h3><p><span class="text Ezek-25-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>&#8216;Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;Because of what Edom did against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and has greatly offended by avenging itself on them,&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>therefore thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;I will also stretch out My hand against Edom, cut off man and beast from it, and make it desolate from Teman; <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>Dedan shall fall by the sword. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>I will lay My vengeance on Edom by the hand of My people Israel, that they may do in Edom according to My anger and according to My fury; and they shall know My vengeance,&#8221; says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>.</span></p> <h3>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>therefore thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;I will stretch out My hand against the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethites and destroy the remnant of the seacoast. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>I will execute great vengeance on them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, when I lay My vengeance upon them.&#8221; &#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-21088a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 25:4">Ezekiel 25:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>sons</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-21097b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 25:13">Ezekiel 25:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>even to Dedan they shall fall</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-21099c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 25:15">Ezekiel 25:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>spite in soul</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-21099d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 25:15">Ezekiel 25:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>perpetual</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
