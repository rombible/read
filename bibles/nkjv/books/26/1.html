<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>On the fifth <i>day</i> of the month, which <i>was</i> in the fifth year of King Jehoiachin&#8217;s captivity, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came expressly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>Chaldeans by the River Chebar; and the hand of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was upon him there.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then I looked, and behold, a whirlwind was coming out of the north, a great cloud with raging fire engulfing itself; and brightness <i>was</i> all around it and radiating out of its midst like the color of amber, out of the midst of the fire. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Also from within it <i>came</i> the likeness of four living creatures. And this <i>was</i> their appearance: they had the likeness of a man. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Each one had four faces, and each one had four wings. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Their <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>legs <i>were</i> straight, and the soles of their feet <i>were</i> like the soles of calves&#8217; feet. They sparkled like the color of burnished bronze. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>The hands of a man <i>were</i> under their wings on their four sides; and each of the four had faces and wings. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Their wings touched one another. <i>The creatures</i> did not turn when they went, but each one went straight forward.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>As for the likeness of their faces, <i>each</i> had the face of a man; each of the four had the face of a lion on the right side, each of the four had the face of an ox on the left side, and each of the four had the face of an eagle. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Thus <i>were</i> their faces. Their wings stretched upward; two <i>wings</i> of each one touched one another, and two covered their bodies. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And each one went straight forward; they went wherever the spirit wanted to go, and they did not turn when they went.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance <i>was</i> like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches going back and forth among the living creatures. The fire was bright, and out of the fire went lightning. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And the living creatures ran back and forth, in appearance like a flash of lightning.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Now as I looked at the living creatures, behold, a wheel <i>was</i> on the earth beside each living creature with its four faces. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>The appearance of the wheels and their workings <i>was</i> like the color of beryl, and all four had the same likeness. The appearance of their workings <i>was,</i> as it were, a wheel in the middle of a wheel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>When they moved, they went toward any one of four directions; they did not turn aside when they went. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>As for their rims, they were so high they were awesome; and their rims <i>were</i> full of eyes, all around the four of them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>When the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Wherever the spirit wanted to go, they went, <i>because</i> there the spirit went; and the wheels were lifted together with them, for the spirit of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>living creatures <i>was</i> in the wheels. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>When those went, <i>these</i> went; when those stood, <i>these</i> stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up together with them, for the spirit of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>living creatures <i>was</i> in the wheels.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>The likeness of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>firmament above the heads of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>living creatures <i>was</i> like the color of an awesome crystal, stretched out over their heads. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And under the firmament their wings <i>spread out</i> straight, one toward another. Each one had two which covered one side, and each one had two which covered the other side of the body. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>When they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of many waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a tumult like the noise of an army; and when they stood still, they let down their wings. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>A voice came from above the firmament that <i>was</i> over their heads; whenever they stood, they let down their wings.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And above the firmament over their heads <i>was</i> the likeness of a throne, in appearance like a sapphire stone; on the likeness of the throne <i>was</i> a likeness with the appearance of a man high above it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Also from the appearance of His waist and upward I saw, as it were, the color of amber with the appearance of fire all around within it; and from the appearance of His waist and downward I saw, as it were, the appearance of fire with brightness all around. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Like the appearance of a rainbow in a cloud on a rainy day, so <i>was</i> the appearance of the brightness all around it.
