<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, because Tyre has said against Jerusalem, &#8216;Aha! She is broken who <i>was</i> the gateway of the peoples; now she is turned over to me; I shall be filled; she is laid waste.&#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8220;Therefore thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8216;Behold, I <i>am</i> against you, O Tyre, and will cause many nations to come up against you, as the sea causes its waves to come up. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And they shall destroy the walls of Tyre and break down her towers; I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her like the top of a rock. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>It shall be <i>a place for</i> spreading nets in the midst of the sea, for I have spoken,&#8217; says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>; &#8216;it shall become plunder for the nations. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Also her daughter <i>villages</i> which <i>are</i> in the fields shall be slain by the sword. Then they shall know that I am the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8220;For thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8216;Behold, I will bring against Tyre from the north Nebuchadnezzar<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span> king of Babylon, king of kings, with horses, with chariots, and with horsemen, and an army with many people. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>He will slay with the sword your daughter <i>villages</i> in the fields; he will heap up a siege mound against you, build a wall against you, and raise a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>defense against you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>He will direct his battering rams against your walls, and with his axes he will break down your towers. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Because of the abundance of his horses, their dust will cover you; your walls will shake at the noise of the horsemen, the wagons, and the chariots, when he enters your gates, as men enter a city that has been breached. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>With the hooves of his horses he will trample all your streets; he will slay your people by the sword, and your strong pillars will fall to the ground. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>They will plunder your riches and pillage your merchandise; they will break down your walls and destroy your pleasant houses; they will lay your stones, your timber, and your soil in the midst of the water. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>I will put an end to the sound of your songs, and the sound of your harps shall be heard no more. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>I will make you like the top of a rock; you shall be <i>a place for</i> spreading nets, and you shall never be rebuilt, for I the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> have spoken,&#8217; says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>&#8220;Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span> to Tyre: &#8216;Will the coastlands not shake at the sound of your fall, when the wounded cry, when slaughter is made in the midst of you? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then all the princes of the sea will come down from their thrones, lay aside their robes, and take off their embroidered garments; they will clothe themselves with trembling; they will sit on the ground, tremble <i>every</i> moment, and be astonished at you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And they will take up a lamentation for you, and say to you:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Ezek-26-17">&#8220;How you have perished,</span><br /><span class="text Ezek-26-17">O one inhabited by seafaring men,</span><br /><span class="text Ezek-26-17">O renowned city,</span><br /><span class="text Ezek-26-17">Who was strong at sea,</span><br /><span class="text Ezek-26-17">She and her inhabitants,</span><br /><span class="text Ezek-26-17">Who caused their terror <i>to be</i> on all her inhabitants!</span><br />
