<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, you dwell in the midst of a rebellious house, which has eyes to see but does not see, and ears to hear but does not hear; for they <i>are</i> a rebellious house.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8220;Therefore, son of man, prepare your belongings for captivity, and go into captivity by day in their sight. You shall go from your place into captivity to another place in their sight. It may be that they will consider, though they <i>are</i> a rebellious house. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>By day you shall bring out your belongings in their sight, as though going into captivity; and at evening you shall go in their sight, like those who go into captivity. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Dig through the wall in their sight, and carry <i>your belongings</i> out through it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>In their sight you shall bear <i>them</i> on <i>your</i> shoulders <i>and</i> carry <i>them</i> out at twilight; you shall cover your face, so that you cannot see the ground, for I have made you a sign to the house of Israel.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So I did as I was commanded. I brought out my belongings by day, as though going into captivity, and at evening I dug through the wall with my hand. I brought <i>them</i> out at twilight, <i>and</i> I bore <i>them</i> on <i>my</i> shoulder in their sight.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And in the morning the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came to me, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, has not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to you, &#8216;What are you doing?&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Say to them, &#8216;Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;This burden<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span> <i>concerns</i> the prince in Jerusalem and all the house of Israel who are among them.&#8221; &#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Say, &#8216;I <i>am</i> a sign to you. As I have done, so shall it be done to them; they shall be carried away into captivity.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And the prince who <i>is</i> among them shall bear <i>his belongings</i> on <i>his</i> shoulder at twilight and go out. They shall dig through the wall to carry <i>them</i> out through it. He shall cover his face, so that he cannot see the ground with <i>his</i> eyes. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>I will also spread My net over him, and he shall be caught in My snare. I will bring him to Babylon, <i>to</i> the land of the Chaldeans; yet he shall not see it, though he shall die there. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>I will scatter to every wind all who <i>are</i> around him to help him, and all his troops; and I will draw out the sword after them.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>&#8220;Then they shall know that I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, when I scatter them among the nations and disperse them throughout the countries. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But I will spare a few of their men from the sword, from famine, and from pestilence, that they may declare all their abominations among the Gentiles wherever they go. Then they shall know that I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Judgment Not Postponed</span></h3><p><span class="text Ezek-12-17"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Moreover the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came to me, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, eat your bread with <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>quaking, and drink your water with trembling and anxiety. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And say to the people of the land, &#8216;Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span> to the inhabitants of Jerusalem <i>and</i> to the land of Israel: &#8220;They shall eat their bread with anxiety, and drink their water with dread, so that her land may be emptied of all who are in it, because of the violence of all those who dwell in it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall become desolate; and you shall know that I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221; &#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came to me, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, what <i>is</i> this proverb <i>that</i> you <i>people</i> have about the land of Israel, which says, &#8216;The days are prolonged, and every vision fails&#8217;? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Tell them therefore, &#8216;Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;I will lay this proverb to rest, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel.&#8221; &#8217; But say to them, &#8216; &#8220;The days are at hand, and the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>fulfillment of every vision. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>For no more shall there be any false<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span> vision or flattering divination within the house of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>For I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Again the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came to me, saying, </span>
