<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, set your face against Gog, of the land of Magog, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, and prophesy against him, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and say, &#8216;Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;Behold, I <i>am</i> against you, O Gog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>I will turn you around, put hooks into your jaws, and lead you out, with all your army, horses, and horsemen, all splendidly clothed, a great company <i>with</i> bucklers and shields, all of them handling swords. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Persia, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>Ethiopia, and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Libya are with them, all of them <i>with</i> shield and helmet; </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>After many days you will be visited. In the latter years you will come into the land of those brought back from the sword <i>and</i> gathered from many people on the mountains of Israel, which had long been desolate; they were brought out of the nations, and now all of them dwell safely. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>You will ascend, coming like a storm, covering the land like a cloud, you and all your troops and many peoples with you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8216;Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;On that day it shall come to pass <i>that</i> thoughts will arise in your mind, and you will make an evil plan: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>You will say, &#8216;I will go up against a land of unwalled villages; I will go to a peaceful people, who dwell <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>safely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates&#8217;&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>to take plunder and to take booty, to stretch out your hand against the waste places <i>that are again</i> inhabited, and against a people gathered from the nations, who have acquired livestock and goods, who dwell in the midst of the land. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Sheba, Dedan, the merchants of Tarshish, and all their young lions will say to you, &#8216;Have you come to take plunder?
