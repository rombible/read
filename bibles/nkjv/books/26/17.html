<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And he took the king&#8217;s offspring, made a covenant with him, and put him under oath. He also took away the mighty of the land, </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But he rebelled against him by sending his ambassadors to Egypt, that they might give him horses and many people.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Nor will Pharaoh with <i>his</i> mighty army and great company do anything in the war, when they heap up a siege mound and build a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>wall to cut off many persons. </span>
