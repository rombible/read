<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, speak to the children of your people, and say to them: &#8216;When I bring the sword upon a land, and the people of the land take a man from their territory and make him their watchman, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>when he sees the sword coming upon the land, if he blows the trumpet and warns the people, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>then whoever hears the sound of the trumpet and does not take warning, if the sword comes and takes him away, his blood shall be on his <i>own</i> head. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>He heard the sound of the trumpet, but did not take warning; his blood shall be upon himself. But he who takes warning will <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>save his life. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet, and the people are not warned, and the sword comes and takes <i>any</i> person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at the watchman&#8217;s hand.&#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8220;So you, son of man: I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel; therefore you shall hear a word from My mouth and warn them for Me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>When I say to the wicked, &#8216;O wicked <i>man,</i> you shall surely die!&#8217; and you do not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked <i>man</i> shall die in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at your hand. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Nevertheless if you warn the wicked to turn from his way, and he does not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>delivered your soul.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8220;Therefore you, O son of man, say to the house of Israel: &#8216;Thus you say, &#8220;If our transgressions and our sins <i>lie</i> upon us, and we pine<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> away in them, how can we then live?&#8221; &#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Say to them: &#8216;<i>As</i> I live,&#8217; says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>, &#8216;I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live. Turn, turn from your evil ways! For why should you die, O house of Israel?&#8217;</span></p> <h3>
The Fairness of God&#8217;s Judgment</span></h3><p><span class="text Ezek-33-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>&#8220;Therefore you, O son of man, say to the children of your people: &#8216;The righteousness of the righteous man shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression; as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall because of it in the day that he turns from his wickedness; nor shall the righteous be able to live because of <i>his righteousness</i> in the day that he sins.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>When I say to the righteous <i>that</i> he shall surely live, but he trusts in his own righteousness and commits iniquity, none of his righteous works shall be remembered; but because of the iniquity that he has committed, he shall die. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Again, when I say to the wicked, &#8216;You shall surely die,&#8217; if he turns from his sin and does <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>what is lawful and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>right, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span><i>if</i> the wicked restores the pledge, gives back what he has stolen, and walks in the statutes of life without committing iniquity, he shall surely live; he shall not die. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>None of his sins which he has committed shall be remembered against him; he has done what is lawful and right; he shall surely live.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>&#8220;Yet the children of your people say, &#8216;The way of the Lord is not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>fair.&#8217; But it is their way which is not fair! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>When the righteous turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, he shall die because of it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>But when the wicked turns from his wickedness and does what is lawful and right, he shall live because of it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Yet you say, &#8216;The way of the Lord is not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>fair.&#8217; O house of Israel, I will judge every one of you according to his own ways.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
The Fall of Jerusalem</span></h3><p><span class="text Ezek-33-21"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth <i>month,</i> on the fifth <i>day</i> of the month, <i>that</i> one who had escaped from Jerusalem came to me and said, &#8220;The city has been <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>captured!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Now the hand of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had been upon me the evening before the man came who had escaped. And He had opened my mouth; so when he came to me in the morning, my mouth was opened, and I was no longer mute.</span></p> <h3>
The Cause of Judah&#8217;s Ruin</span></h3><p><span class="text Ezek-33-23"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Then the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came to me, saying: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, they who inhabit those ruins in the land of Israel are saying, &#8216;Abraham was only one, and he inherited the land. But we <i>are</i> many; the land has been given to us as a possession.&#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>&#8220;Therefore say to them, &#8216;Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;You eat <i>meat</i> with blood, you lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed blood. Should you then possess the land? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>You rely on your sword, you commit abominations, and you defile one another&#8217;s wives. Should you then possess the land?&#8221; &#8217;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>&#8220;Say thus to them, &#8216;Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;<i>As</i> I live, surely those who <i>are</i> in the ruins shall fall by the sword, and the one who <i>is</i> in the open field I will give to the beasts to be devoured, and those who <i>are</i> in the strongholds and caves shall die of the pestilence. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>For I will make the land most desolate, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>her arrogant strength shall cease, and the mountains of Israel shall be so desolate that no one will pass through. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Then they shall know that I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, when I have made the land most desolate because of all their abominations which they have committed.&#8221; &#8217;</span></p> <h3>
Hearing and Not Doing</span></h3><p><span class="text Ezek-33-30"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>&#8220;As for you, son of man, the children of your people are talking about you beside the walls and in the doors of the houses; and they speak to one another, everyone saying to his brother, &#8216;Please come and hear what the word is that comes from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>So they come to you as people do, they sit before you <i>as</i> My people, and they hear your words, but they do not do them; for with their mouth they show much love, <i>but</i> their hearts pursue their <i>own</i> gain. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Indeed you <i>are</i> to them as a very lovely song of one who has a pleasant voice and can play well on an instrument; for they hear your words, but they do not do them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And when this comes to pass&#8212;surely it will come&#8212;then they will know that a prophet has been among them.&#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-21286a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 33:5">Ezekiel 33:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>deliver his soul</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-21290b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 33:9">Ezekiel 33:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>saved your life</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-21291c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 33:10">Ezekiel 33:10</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>waste away</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-21295d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 33:14">Ezekiel 33:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>justice</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-21295e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 33:14">Ezekiel 33:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>righteousness</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-21298f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 33:17">Ezekiel 33:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>equitable</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-21301g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 33:20">Ezekiel 33:20</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>equitable</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-21302h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 33:21">Ezekiel 33:21</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>struck down</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-21309i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 33:28">Ezekiel 33:28</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>pride of her strength</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
