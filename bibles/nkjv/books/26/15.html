<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, how is the wood of the vine <i>better</i> than any other wood, the vine branch which is among the trees of the forest? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Is wood taken from it to make any object? Or can <i>men</i> make a peg from it to hang any vessel on? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Instead, it is thrown into the fire for fuel; the fire devours both ends of it, and its middle is burned. Is it useful for <i>any</i> work? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Indeed, when it was whole, no object could be made from it. How much less will it be useful for <i>any</i> work when the fire has devoured it, and it is burned?</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>&#8220;Therefore thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8216;Like the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so I will give up the inhabitants of Jerusalem; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and I will set My face against them. They will go out from <i>one</i> fire, but <i>another</i> fire shall devour them. Then you shall know that I <i>am</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, when I set My face against them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Thus I will make the land desolate, because they have persisted in unfaithfulness,&#8217; says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>.&#8221;</span></p> </div></div></body></html>
