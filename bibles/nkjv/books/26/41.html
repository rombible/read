<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>The width of the entryway <i>was</i> ten cubits, and the side walls of the entrance <i>were</i> five cubits on this side and five cubits on the other side; and he measured its length, forty cubits, and its width, twenty cubits.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Also he went inside and measured the doorposts, two cubits; and the entrance, six cubits <i>high;</i> and the width of the entrance, seven cubits. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>He measured the length, twenty cubits; and the width, twenty cubits, beyond the sanctuary; and he said to me, &#8220;This <i>is</i> the Most Holy <i>Place.</i>&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
The Side Chambers on the Wall</span></h3><p><span class="text Ezek-41-5"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Next, he measured the wall of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>temple, six cubits. The width of each side chamber all around the temple <i>was</i> four cubits on every side. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>The side chambers <i>were</i> in three stories, one above the other, thirty chambers in each story; they rested on <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>ledges which <i>were</i> for the side chambers all around, that they might be supported, but not fastened to the wall of the temple. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>As one went up from story to story, the side chambers became wider all around, because their supporting ledges in the wall of the temple ascended like steps; therefore the width of the structure increased as one went up <i>from</i> the lowest <i>story</i> to the highest by way of the middle one. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>I also saw an elevation all around the temple; it was the foundation of the side chambers, a full rod, <i>that is,</i> six cubits <i>high.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>The thickness of the outer wall of the side chambers <i>was</i> five cubits, and so also the remaining terrace by the place of the side chambers of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>temple. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And between <i>it and</i> the <i>wall</i> chambers was a width of twenty cubits all around the temple on every side. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>The doors of the side chambers opened on the terrace, one door toward the north and another toward the south; and the width of the terrace <i>was</i> five cubits all around.</span></p> <h3>
The Building at the Western End</span></h3><p><span class="text Ezek-41-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>The building that faced the separating courtyard at its western end <i>was</i> seventy cubits wide; the wall of the building <i>was</i> five cubits thick all around, and its length ninety cubits.</span></p> <h3>
Dimensions and Design of the Temple Area</span></h3><p><span class="text Ezek-41-13"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So he measured the temple, one hundred cubits long; and the separating courtyard with the building and its walls <i>was</i> one hundred cubits long; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>also the width of the eastern face of the temple, including the separating courtyard, <i>was</i> one hundred cubits. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>He measured the length of the building behind it, facing the separating courtyard, with its galleries on the one side and on the other side, one hundred cubits, as well as the inner <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>temple and the porches of the court, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>their doorposts and the beveled window frames. And the galleries all around their three stories opposite the threshold were paneled with wood from the ground to the windows&#8212;the windows were covered&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>from the space above the door, even to the inner <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>room, as well as outside, and on every wall all around, inside and outside, by measure.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And <i>it was</i> made with cherubim and palm trees, a palm tree between cherub and cherub. <i>Each</i> cherub had two faces, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>so that the face of a man <i>was</i> toward a palm tree on one side, and the face of a young lion toward a palm tree on the other side; thus <i>it was</i> made throughout the temple all around. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>From the floor to the space above the door, and on the wall of the sanctuary, cherubim and palm trees <i>were</i> carved.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>The doorposts of the temple <i>were</i> square, <i>as was</i> the front of the sanctuary; their appearance was similar. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>The altar <i>was</i> of wood, three cubits high, and its length two cubits. Its corners, its length, and its sides <i>were</i> of wood; and he said to me, &#8220;This <i>is</i> the table that <i>is</i> before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>The temple and the sanctuary had two doors. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>The doors had two panels <i>apiece,</i> two folding panels: two <i>panels</i> for one door and two panels for the other <i>door.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Cherubim and palm trees <i>were</i> carved on the doors of the temple just as they <i>were</i> carved on the walls. A wooden canopy <i>was</i> on the front of the vestibule outside. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span><i>There were</i> beveled window <i>frames</i> and palm trees on one side and on the other, on the sides of the vestibule&#8212;also on the side chambers of the temple and on the canopies.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-21528a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 41:1">Ezekiel 41:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. <i>heykal;</i> the main room in the temple, the holy place, <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Exod.26.33" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=Exod.26.33&amp;version=NKJV">Ex. 26:33</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-21532b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 41:5">Ezekiel 41:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>house</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-21533c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 41:6">Ezekiel 41:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>the wall</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-21536d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 41:9">Ezekiel 41:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>house</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-21542e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 41:15">Ezekiel 41:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>sanctuary</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-21544f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 41:17">Ezekiel 41:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>house;</i> the Most Holy Place</span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
