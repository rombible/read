<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then He spoke to the man clothed with linen, and said, &#8220;Go in among the wheels, under the cherub, fill your hands with coals of fire from among the cherubim, and scatter <i>them</i> over the city.&#8221; And he went in as I watched.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Now the cherubim were standing on the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>south side of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>temple when the man went in, and the cloud filled the inner court. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then the glory of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> went up from the cherub, <i>and paused</i> over the threshold of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>temple; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s glory. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard <i>even</i> in the outer court, like the voice of Almighty God when He speaks.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then it happened, when He commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, &#8220;Take fire from among the wheels, from among the cherubim,&#8221; that he went in and stood beside the wheels. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And the cherub stretched out his hand from among the cherubim to the fire that <i>was</i> among the cherubim, and took <i>some of it</i> and put <i>it</i> into the hands of the <i>man</i> clothed with linen, who took <i>it</i> and went out. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>The cherubim appeared to have the form of a man&#8217;s hand under their wings.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And when I looked, there were four wheels by the cherubim, one wheel by one cherub and another wheel by each other cherub; the wheels appeared <i>to have</i> the color of a beryl stone. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><i>As for</i> their appearance, all four looked alike&#8212;as it were, a wheel in the middle of a wheel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>When they went, they went toward <i>any of</i> their four directions; they did not turn aside when they went, but followed in the direction the head was facing. They did not turn aside when they went. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And their whole body, with their back, their hands, their wings, and the wheels that the four had, <i>were</i> full of eyes all around. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>As for the wheels, they were called in my <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>hearing, &#8220;Wheel.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Each one had four faces: the first face <i>was</i> the face of a cherub, the second face the face of a man, the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And the cherubim were lifted up. This <i>was</i> the living creature I saw by the River Chebar. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>When the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubim lifted their wings to mount up from the earth, the same wheels also did not turn from beside them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>When <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span><i>the cherubim</i> stood still, <i>the wheels</i> stood still, and when <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span><i>one</i> was lifted up, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span><i>the other</i> lifted itself up, for the spirit of the living creature <i>was</i> in them.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then the glory of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> departed from the threshold of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>temple and stood over the cherubim. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And the cherubim lifted their wings and mounted up from the earth in my sight. When they went out, the wheels <i>were</i> beside them; and they stood at the door of the east gate of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s house, and the glory of the God of Israel <i>was</i> above them.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>This <i>is</i> the living creature I saw under the God of Israel by the River Chebar, and I knew they <i>were</i> cherubim. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Each one had four faces and each one four wings, and the likeness of the hands of a man <i>was</i> under their wings. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And the likeness of their faces <i>was</i> the same <i>as</i> the faces which I had seen by the River Chebar, their appearance and their persons. They each went straight forward.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-20635a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 10:1">Ezekiel 10:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>expanse</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-20637b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 10:3">Ezekiel 10:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>right</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-20637c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 10:3">Ezekiel 10:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>house</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-20638d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 10:4">Ezekiel 10:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>house</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-20647e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 10:13">Ezekiel 10:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>ears</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-20651f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 10:17">Ezekiel 10:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>they</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-20651g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 10:17">Ezekiel 10:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>they were</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-20651h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 10:17">Ezekiel 10:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>they lifted them</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-20652i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 10:18">Ezekiel 10:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>house</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
