<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And suddenly six men came from the direction of the upper gate, which faces north, each with his <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>battle-ax in his hand. One man among them <i>was</i> clothed with linen and had a writer&#8217;s inkhorn <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>at his side. They went in and stood beside the bronze altar.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Now the glory of the God of Israel had gone up from the cherub, where it had been, to the threshold of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>temple. And He called to the man clothed with linen, who <i>had</i> the writer&#8217;s inkhorn at his side; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to him, &#8220;Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and put a mark on the foreheads of the men who sigh and cry over all the abominations that are done within it.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>To the others He said in my <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>hearing, &#8220;Go after him through the city and kill;<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span> do not let your eye spare, nor have any pity. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Utterly<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span> slay old <i>and</i> young men, maidens and little children and women; but do not come near anyone on whom <i>is</i> the mark; and begin at My sanctuary.&#8221; So they began with the elders who <i>were</i> before the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>temple. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then He said to them, &#8220;Defile the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>temple, and fill the courts with the slain. Go out!&#8221; And they went out and killed in the city.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So it was, that while they were killing them, I was left <i>alone;</i> and I fell on my face and cried out, and said, &#8220;Ah, Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>! Will You destroy all the remnant of Israel in pouring out Your fury on Jerusalem?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then He said to me, &#8220;The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah <i>is</i> exceedingly great, and the land is full of bloodshed, and the city full of perversity; for they say, &#8216;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has forsaken the land, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> does not see!&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And as for Me also, My eye will neither spare, nor will I have pity, <i>but</i> I will recompense their deeds on their own head.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Just then, the man clothed with linen, who <i>had</i> the inkhorn at his side, reported back and said, &#8220;I have done as You commanded me.&#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-20624a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 9:1">Ezekiel 9:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>destroying</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-20625b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 9:2">Ezekiel 9:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>shattering weapon</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-20625c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 9:2">Ezekiel 9:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>upon his loins</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-20626d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 9:3">Ezekiel 9:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>house</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-20628e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 9:5">Ezekiel 9:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>ears</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-20628f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 9:5">Ezekiel 9:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>strike</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-20629g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 9:6">Ezekiel 9:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Slay to destruction</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-20629h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 9:6">Ezekiel 9:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>house</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-20630i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 9:7">Ezekiel 9:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>house</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
