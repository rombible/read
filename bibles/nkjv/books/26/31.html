<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, say to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his multitude:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Ezek-31-2">&#8216;Whom are you like in your greatness?</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Indeed Assyria <i>was</i> a cedar in Lebanon,</span><br /><span class="text Ezek-31-3">With fine branches that shaded the forest,</span><br /><span class="text Ezek-31-3">And of high stature;</span><br /><span class="text Ezek-31-3">And its top was among the thick boughs.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>The waters made it grow;</span><br /><span class="text Ezek-31-4">Underground waters gave it height,</span><br /><span class="text Ezek-31-4">With their rivers running around the place where it was planted,</span><br /><span class="text Ezek-31-4">And sent out <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>rivulets to all the trees of the field.</span></p></div> <div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8216;Therefore its height was exalted above all the trees of the field;</span><br /><span class="text Ezek-31-5">Its boughs were multiplied,</span><br /><span class="text Ezek-31-5">And its branches became long because of the abundance of water,</span><br /><span class="text Ezek-31-5">As it sent them out.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>All the birds of the heavens made their nests in its boughs;</span><br /><span class="text Ezek-31-6">Under its branches all the beasts of the field brought forth their young;</span><br /><span class="text Ezek-31-6">And in its shadow all great nations <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>made their home.</span></p></div> <div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8216;Thus it was beautiful in greatness and in the length of its branches,</span><br /><span class="text Ezek-31-7">Because its roots reached to abundant waters.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>The cedars in the garden of God could not hide it;</span><br /><span class="text Ezek-31-8">The fir trees were not like its boughs,</span><br /><span class="text Ezek-31-8">And the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>chestnut trees were not like its branches;</span><br /><span class="text Ezek-31-8">No tree in the garden of God was like it in beauty.</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>I made it beautiful with a multitude of branches,</span><br /><span class="text Ezek-31-9">So that all the trees of Eden envied it,</span><br /><span class="text Ezek-31-9">That <i>were</i> in the garden of God.&#8217;</span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8220;Therefore thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8216;Because you have increased in height, and it set its top among the thick boughs, and its heart was <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>lifted up in its height, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>therefore I will deliver it into the hand of the mighty one of the nations, and he shall surely deal with it; I have driven it out for its wickedness. </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So that no trees by the waters may ever again exalt themselves for their height, nor set their tops among the thick boughs, that no tree which drinks water may ever be high enough to reach up to them.</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Ezek-31-14">&#8216;For they have all been delivered to death,</span><br /><span class="text Ezek-31-14">To the depths of the earth,</span><br /><span class="text Ezek-31-14">Among the children of men who go down to the Pit.&#8217;</span></p></div> <p class="top-1">

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>I made the nations shake at the sound of its fall, when I cast it down to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>hell together with those who descend into the Pit; and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, were comforted in the depths of the earth. </span>
