<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Lay siege against it, build a siege wall against it, and heap up a mound against it; set camps against it also, and place battering rams against it all around. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Moreover take for yourself an iron plate, and set it <i>as</i> an iron wall between you and the city. Set your face against it, and it shall be besieged, and you shall lay siege against it. This <i>will be</i> a sign to the house of Israel.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8220;Lie also on your left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it. <i>According</i> to the number of the days that you lie on it, you shall bear their iniquity. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For I have laid on you the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days; so you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And when you have completed them, lie again on your right side; then you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days. I have laid on you a day for each year.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8220;Therefore you shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem; your arm <i>shall be</i> uncovered, and you shall prophesy against it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And surely I will <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>restrain you so that you cannot turn from one side to another till you have ended the days of your siege.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;Also take for yourself wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt; put them into one vessel, and make bread of them for yourself. <i>During</i> the number of days that you lie on your side, three hundred and ninety days, you shall eat it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And your food which you eat <i>shall be</i> by weight, twenty shekels a day; from time to time you shall eat it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>You shall also drink water by measure, one-sixth of a hin; from time to time you shall drink. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And you shall eat it <i>as</i> barley cakes; and bake it using fuel of human waste in their sight.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said, &#8220;So shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles, where I will drive them.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So I said, &#8220;Ah, Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>! Indeed I have never defiled myself from my youth till now; I have never eaten what died of itself or was torn by beasts, nor has abominable<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span> flesh ever come into my mouth.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then He said to me, &#8220;See, I am giving you cow dung instead of human waste, and you shall prepare your bread over it.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Moreover He said to me, &#8220;Son of man, surely I will cut off the supply of bread in Jerusalem; they shall eat bread by weight and with anxiety, and shall drink water by measure and with dread, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>that they may lack bread and water, and be dismayed with one another, and waste away because of their iniquity.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-20538a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 4:8">Ezekiel 4:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>put ropes on</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-20544b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 4:14">Ezekiel 4:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Ritually unclean flesh, <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Lev.7.18" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=Lev.7.18&amp;version=NKJV">Lev. 7:18</span></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
