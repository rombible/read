<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>He brought me out by way of the north gate, and led me around on the outside to the outer gateway that faces east; and there was water, running out on the right side.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And when the man went out to the east with the line in his hand, he measured one thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the water <i>came up to my</i> ankles. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Again he measured one thousand and brought me through the waters; the water <i>came up to my</i> knees. Again he measured one thousand and brought me through; the water <i>came up to my</i> waist. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Again he measured one thousand, <i>and it was</i> a river that I could not cross; for the water was too deep, water in which one must swim, a river that could not be crossed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>He said to me, &#8220;Son of man, have you seen <i>this?</i>&#8221; Then he brought me and returned me to the bank of the river.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>When I returned, there, along the bank of the river, <i>were</i> very many trees on one side and the other. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then he said to me: &#8220;This water flows toward the eastern region, goes down into the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>valley, and enters the sea. <i>When it</i> reaches the sea, <i>its</i> waters are healed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And it shall be <i>that</i> every living thing that moves, wherever <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>the rivers go, will live. There will be a very great multitude of fish, because these waters go there; for they will be healed, and everything will live wherever the river goes. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>It shall be <i>that</i> fishermen will stand by it from En Gedi to En Eglaim; they will be <i>places</i> for spreading their nets. Their fish will be of the same kinds as the fish of the Great Sea, exceedingly many. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But its swamps and marshes will not be healed; they will be given over to salt. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Along the bank of the river, on this side and that, will grow all <i>kinds of</i> trees used for food; their leaves will not wither, and their fruit will not fail. They will bear fruit every month, because their water flows from the sanctuary. Their fruit will be for food, and their leaves for medicine.&#8221;<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span></span></p> <h3>
Borders of the Land</span></h3><p><span class="text Ezek-47-13"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>: &#8220;These <i>are</i> the borders by which you shall divide the land as an inheritance among the twelve tribes of Israel.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>You shall inherit it equally with one another; for I raised My hand in an oath to give it to your fathers, and this land shall fall to you as your inheritance.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>&#8220;This <i>shall be</i> the border of the land on the north: from the Great Sea, <i>by</i> the road to Hethlon, as one goes to Zedad, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim (which <i>is</i> between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath), to Hazar Hatticon (which <i>is</i> on the border of Hauran). </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Thus the boundary shall be from the Sea to Hazar Enan, the border of Damascus; and as for the north, northward, it is the border of Hamath. <i>This is</i> the north side.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>&#8220;On the east side you shall mark out the border from between Hauran and Damascus, and between Gilead and the land of Israel, along the Jordan, and along the eastern side of the sea. <i>This is</i> the east side.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>&#8220;The south side, toward the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>South, <i>shall be</i> from Tamar to the waters of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>Meribah by Kadesh, along the brook to the Great Sea. <i>This is</i> the south side, toward the South.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>&#8220;The west side <i>shall be</i> the Great Sea, from the <i>southern</i> boundary until one comes to a point opposite Hamath. This <i>is</i> the west side.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>&#8220;Thus you shall divide this land among yourselves according to the tribes of Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>It shall be that you will divide it by lot as an inheritance for yourselves, and for the strangers who dwell among you and who bear children among you.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And it shall be <i>that</i> in whatever tribe the stranger dwells, there you shall give <i>him</i> his inheritance,&#8221; says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-21681a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 47:1">Ezekiel 47:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>house</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-21688b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 47:8">Ezekiel 47:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>Arabah,</i> the Jordan Valley</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-21689c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 47:9">Ezekiel 47:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>two rivers</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-21692d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 47:12">Ezekiel 47:12</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>healing</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-21699e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 47:19">Ezekiel 47:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. <i>Negev</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-21699f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Ezekiel 47:19">Ezekiel 47:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Strife</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
