<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So he prayed to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and said, &#8220;Ah, <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, was not this what I said when I was still in my country? Therefore I fled previously to Tarshish; for I know that You <i>are</i> a gracious and merciful God, slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness, One who relents from doing harm. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Therefore now, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, please take my life from me, for <i>it is</i> better for me to die than to live!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said, &#8220;<i>Is it</i> right for you to be angry?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So Jonah went out of the city and sat on the east side of the city. There he made himself a shelter and sat under it in the shade, till he might see what would become of the city. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God prepared a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>plant and made it come up over Jonah, that it might be shade for his head to deliver him from his misery. So Jonah <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>was very grateful for the plant. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But as morning dawned the next day God prepared a worm, and it <i>so</i> damaged the plant that it withered. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And it happened, when the sun arose, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat on Jonah&#8217;s head, so that he grew faint. Then he wished death for himself, and said, &#8220;<i>It is</i> better for me to die than to live.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then God said to Jonah, &#8220;<i>Is it</i> right for you to be angry about the plant?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text Jonah-4-9">And he said, &#8220;<i>It is</i> right for me to be angry, even to death!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>But the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said, &#8220;You have had pity on the plant for which you have not labored, nor made it grow, which <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>came up in a night and perished in a night. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And should I not pity Nineveh, that great city, in which are more than one hundred and twenty thousand persons who cannot discern between their right hand and their left&#8212;and much livestock?&#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-22575a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jonah 4:6">Jonah 4:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. <i>kikayon,</i> exact identity unknown</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-22575b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jonah 4:6">Jonah 4:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>rejoiced with great joy</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-22579c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jonah 4:10">Jonah 4:10</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>was a son of a night</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
