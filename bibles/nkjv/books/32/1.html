<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry out against it; for their wickedness has come up before Me.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But Jonah arose to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. He went down to Joppa, and found a ship going to Tarshish; so he paid the fare, and went down into it, to go with them to Tarshish from the presence of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.</span></p> <h3>
The Storm at Sea</span></h3><p><span class="text Jonah-1-4"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>sent out a great wind on the sea, and there was a mighty tempest on the sea, so that the ship was about to be broken up.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then the mariners were afraid; and every man cried out to his god, and threw the cargo that <i>was</i> in the ship into the sea, to lighten <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>the load. But Jonah had gone down into the lowest parts of the ship, had lain down, and was fast asleep.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So the captain came to him, and said to him, &#8220;What do you mean, sleeper? Arise, call on your God; perhaps your God will consider us, so that we may not perish.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And they said to one another, &#8220;Come, let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this trouble <i>has come</i> upon us.&#8221; So they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then they said to him, &#8220;Please tell us! For whose cause <i>is</i> this trouble upon us? What is your occupation? And where do you come from? What is your country? And of what people are you?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So he said to them, &#8220;I <i>am</i> a Hebrew; and I fear <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry <i>land.</i>&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Jonah Thrown into the Sea</span></h3><p><span class="text Jonah-1-10"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then the men were exceedingly afraid, and said to him, &#8220;Why have you done this?&#8221; For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, because he had told them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then they said to him, &#8220;What shall we do to you that the sea may be calm for us?&#8221;&#8212;for the sea was growing more tempestuous.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And he said to them, &#8220;Pick me up and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>throw me into the sea; then the sea will become calm for you. For I know that this great tempest <i>is</i> because of me.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Nevertheless the men rowed hard to return to land, but they could not, for the sea continued to grow more tempestuous against them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Therefore they cried out to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and said, &#8220;We pray, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, please do not let us perish for this man&#8217;s life, and do not charge us with innocent blood; for You, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, have done as it pleased You.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So they picked up Jonah and threw him into the sea, and the sea ceased from its raging. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then the men feared the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and took vows.</span></p> <h3>
Jonah&#8217;s Prayer and Deliverance</span></h3><p><span class="text Jonah-1-17"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Now the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had prepared a great fish to swallow Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-22536a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jonah 1:4">Jonah 1:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>hurled</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-22537b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jonah 1:5">Jonah 1:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>from upon them</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-22541c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jonah 1:9">Jonah 1:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. <i>YHWH</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-22544d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Jonah 1:12">Jonah 1:12</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>hurl</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
