<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Now Absalom would rise early and stand beside the way to the gate. <i>So</i> it was, whenever anyone who had a lawsuit<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span> came to the king for a decision, that Absalom would call to him and say, &#8220;What city <i>are</i> you from?&#8221; And he would say, &#8220;Your servant <i>is</i> from such and such a tribe of Israel.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then Absalom would say to him, &#8220;Look, your <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>case <i>is</i> good and right; but <i>there is</i> no <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>deputy of the king to hear you.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Moreover Absalom would say, &#8220;Oh, that I were made judge in the land, and everyone who has any suit or cause would come to me; then I would give him justice.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And <i>so</i> it was, whenever anyone came near to bow down to him, that he would put out his hand and take him and kiss him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>In this manner Absalom acted toward all Israel who came to the king for judgment. So Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now it came to pass after <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>forty years that Absalom said to the king, &#8220;Please, let me go to Hebron and pay the vow which I made to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For your servant took a vow while I dwelt at Geshur in Syria, saying, &#8216;If the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> indeed brings me back to Jerusalem, then I will serve the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And the king said to him, &#8220;Go in peace.&#8221; So he arose and went to Hebron.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, &#8220;As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then you shall say, &#8216;Absalom reigns in Hebron!&#8217; &#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And with Absalom went two hundred men invited from Jerusalem, and they went along innocently and did not know anything. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David&#8217;s counselor, from his city&#8212;from Giloh&#8212;while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy grew strong, for the people with Absalom continually increased in number.</span></p> <h3>
David Escapes from Jerusalem</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Sam-15-13"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Now a messenger came to David, saying, &#8220;The hearts of the men of Israel are <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>with Absalom.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So David said to all his servants who <i>were</i> with him at Jerusalem, &#8220;Arise, and let us flee, or we shall not escape from Absalom. Make haste to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly and bring disaster upon us, and strike the city with the edge of the sword.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And the king&#8217;s servants said to the king, &#8220;We <i>are</i> your servants, <i>ready to do</i> whatever my lord the king commands.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then the king went out with all his household after him. But the king left ten women, concubines, to keep the house. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And the king went out with all the people after him, and stopped at the outskirts. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then all his servants passed <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>before him; and all the Cherethites, all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men who had followed him from Gath, passed before the king.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, &#8220;Why are you also going with us? Return and remain with the king. For you <i>are</i> a foreigner and also an exile from your own place. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>In fact, you came <i>only</i> yesterday. Should I make you wander up and down with us today, since I go I know not where? Return, and take your brethren back. Mercy and truth <i>be</i> with you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>But Ittai answered the king and said, &#8220;<i>As</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> lives, and <i>as</i> my lord the king lives, surely in whatever place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also your servant will be.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So David said to Ittai, &#8220;Go, and cross over.&#8221; Then Ittai the Gittite and all his men and all the little ones who <i>were</i> with him crossed over. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people crossed over. The king himself also crossed over the Brook Kidron, and all the people crossed over toward the way of the wilderness.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>There was Zadok also, and all the Levites with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God. And they set down the ark of God, and Abiathar went up until all the people had finished crossing over from the city. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then the king said to Zadok, &#8220;Carry the ark of God back into the city. If I find favor in the eyes of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, He will bring me back and show me <i>both</i> it and His dwelling place. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>But if He says thus: &#8216;I have no delight in you,&#8217; here I am, let Him do to me as seems good to Him.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>The king also said to Zadok the priest, &#8220;<i>Are</i> you <i>not</i> a seer?<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span> Return to the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>See, I will wait in the plains of the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Therefore Zadok and Abiathar carried the ark of God back to Jerusalem. And they remained there.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>So David went up by the Ascent of the <i>Mount of</i> Olives, and wept as he went up; and he had his head covered and went barefoot. And all the people who <i>were</i> with him covered their heads and went up, weeping as they went up. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Then <i>someone</i> told David, saying, &#8220;Ahithophel <i>is</i> among the conspirators with Absalom.&#8221; And David said, &#8220;O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, I pray, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Now it happened when David had come to the top <i>of the mountain,</i> where he worshiped God&#8212;there was Hushai the Archite coming to meet him with his robe torn and dust on his head. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>David said to him, &#8220;If you go on with me, then you will become a burden to me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>But if you return to the city, and say to Absalom, &#8216;I will be your servant, O king; <i>as</i> I <i>was</i> your father&#8217;s servant previously, so I <i>will</i> now also <i>be</i> your servant,&#8217; then you may defeat the counsel of Ahithophel for me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>And <i>do</i> you not <i>have</i> Zadok and Abiathar the priests with you there? Therefore it will be <i>that</i> whatever you hear from the king&#8217;s house, you shall tell to Zadok and Abiathar the priests. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Indeed <i>they have</i> there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz, Zadok&#8217;s <i>son,</i> and Jonathan, Abiathar&#8217;s <i>son;</i> and by them you shall send me everything you hear.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>So Hushai, David&#8217;s friend, went into the city. And Absalom came into Jerusalem.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-8392a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 15:2">2 Samuel 15:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>controversy</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8393b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 15:3">2 Samuel 15:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>words</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8393c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 15:3">2 Samuel 15:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>listener</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8397d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 15:7">2 Samuel 15:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'>LXX mss., Syr., Josephus <i>four</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8403e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 15:13">2 Samuel 15:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>after</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8408f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 15:18">2 Samuel 15:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>by his hand</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8417g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 15:27">2 Samuel 15:27</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>prophet</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
