<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Also, in time past, when Saul was king over us, you were the one who led Israel out and brought them in; and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to you, &#8216;You shall shepherd My people Israel, and be ruler over Israel.&#8217; &#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Therefore all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and King David made a covenant with them at Hebron before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. And they anointed David king over Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>David <i>was</i> thirty years old when he began to reign, <i>and</i> he reigned forty years. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.</span></p> <h3>
The Conquest of Jerusalem</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Sam-5-6"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spoke to David, saying, &#8220;You shall not come in here; but the blind and the lame will repel you,&#8221; thinking, &#8220;David cannot come in here.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion (that <i>is,</i> the City of David).</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Now David said on that day, &#8220;Whoever climbs up by way of the water shaft and defeats the Jebusites (the lame and the blind, <i>who are</i> hated by David&#8217;s soul), <i>he shall be chief and captain.</i>&#8221; Therefore they say, &#8220;The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then David dwelt in the stronghold, and called it the City of David. And David built all around from <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>the Millo and inward. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So David went on and became great, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of hosts <i>was</i> with him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters and masons. And they built David a house. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So David knew that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had established him as king over Israel, and that He had exalted His kingdom for the sake of His people Israel.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem, after he had come from Hebron. Also more sons and daughters were born to David. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Now these <i>are</i> the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Ibhar, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.</span></p> <h3>
The Philistines Defeated</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Sam-5-17"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Now when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to search for David. And David heard <i>of it</i> and went down to the stronghold. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>The Philistines also went and deployed themselves in the Valley of Rephaim. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>So David inquired of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, saying, &#8220;Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will You deliver them into my hand?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-5-19">And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> said to David, &#8220;Go up, for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into your hand.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So David went to Baal Perazim, and David defeated them there; and he said, &#8220;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has broken through my enemies before me, like a breakthrough of water.&#8221; Therefore he called the name of that place <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>Baal Perazim. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And they left their <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>images there, and David and his men carried them away.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then the Philistines went up once again and deployed themselves in the Valley of Rephaim. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Therefore David inquired of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and He said, &#8220;You shall not go up; circle around behind them, and come upon them in front of the mulberry trees. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And it shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, then you shall advance quickly. For then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will go out before you to strike the camp of the Philistines.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And David did so, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> commanded him; and he drove back the Philistines from Geba<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span> as far as Gezer.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-8142a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 5:9">2 Samuel 5:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>The Landfill</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8147b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 5:14">2 Samuel 5:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Shimea,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="1Chr.3.5" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=1Chr.3.5&amp;version=NKJV">1 Chr. 3:5</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8148c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 5:15">2 Samuel 5:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Elishama,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="1Chr.3.6" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=1Chr.3.6&amp;version=NKJV">1 Chr. 3:6</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8153d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 5:20">2 Samuel 5:20</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Master of Breakthroughs</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8154e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 5:21">2 Samuel 5:21</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>idols</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8158f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 5:25">2 Samuel 5:25</span> <span class='footnote-text'>So with MT, Tg., Vg.; LXX <i>Gibeon</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
