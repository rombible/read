And he blew a trumpet, and said:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text 2Sam-20-1">&#8220;We have no share in David,</span><br /><span class="text 2Sam-20-1">Nor do we have inheritance in the son of Jesse;</span><br /><span class="text 2Sam-20-1">Every man to his tents, O Israel!&#8221;</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So every man of Israel deserted David, <i>and</i> followed Sheba the son of Bichri. But the men of Judah, from the Jordan as far as Jerusalem, remained loyal to their king.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Now David came to his house at Jerusalem. And the king took the ten women, his concubines whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in seclusion and supported them, but did not go in to them. So they were shut up to the day of their death, living in widowhood.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And the king said to Amasa, &#8220;Assemble the men of Judah for me within three days, and be present here yourself.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So Amasa went to assemble <i>the men of</i> Judah. But he delayed longer than the set time which David had appointed him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And David said to Abishai, &#8220;Now Sheba the son of Bichri will do us more harm than Absalom. Take your lord&#8217;s servants and pursue him, lest he find for himself fortified cities, and escape us.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So Joab&#8217;s men, with the Cherethites, the Pelethites, and all the mighty men, went out after him. And they went out of Jerusalem to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>When they <i>were</i> at the large stone which <i>is</i> in Gibeon, Amasa came before them. Now Joab was dressed in battle armor; on it was a belt <i>with</i> a sword fastened in its sheath at his hips; and as he was going forward, it fell out. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then Joab said to Amasa, &#8220;<i>Are</i> you in health, my brother?&#8221; And Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>But Amasa did not notice the sword that <i>was</i> in Joab&#8217;s hand. And he struck him with it in the stomach, and his entrails poured out on the ground; and he did not <i>strike</i> him again. Thus he died.</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-20-10">Then Joab and Abishai his brother pursued Sheba the son of Bichri. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Meanwhile one of Joab&#8217;s men stood near Amasa, and said, &#8220;Whoever favors Joab and whoever <i>is</i> for David&#8212;follow Joab!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But Amasa wallowed in <i>his</i> blood in the middle of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he moved Amasa from the highway to the field and threw a garment over him, when he saw that everyone who came upon him halted. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>When he was removed from the highway, all the people went on after Joab to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And he went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel and Beth Maachah and all the Berites. So they were gathered together and also went after <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span><i>Sheba</i>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth Maachah; and they cast up a siege mound against the city, and it stood by the rampart. And all the people who <i>were</i> with Joab battered the wall to throw it down.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then a wise woman cried out from the city, &#8220;Hear, hear! Please say to Joab, &#8216;Come nearby, that I may speak with you.&#8217; &#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>When he had come near to her, the woman said, &#8220;<i>Are</i> you Joab?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-20-17">He answered, &#8220;I <i>am.</i>&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-20-17">Then she said to him, &#8220;Hear the words of your maidservant.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-20-17">And he answered, &#8220;I am listening.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>So she spoke, saying, &#8220;They used to talk in former times, saying, &#8216;They shall surely seek <i>guidance</i> at Abel,&#8217; and so they would end <i>disputes.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>I <i>am among the</i> peaceable <i>and</i> faithful in Israel. You seek to destroy a city and a mother in Israel. Why would you swallow up the inheritance of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And Joab answered and said, &#8220;Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>That <i>is</i> not so. But a man from the mountains of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, has raised his hand against the king, against David. Deliver him only, and I will depart from the city.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-20-21">So the woman said to Joab, &#8220;Watch, his head will be thrown to you over the wall.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then the woman in her wisdom went to all the people. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and threw <i>it</i> out to Joab. Then he blew a trumpet, and they withdrew from the city, every man to his tent. So Joab returned to the king at Jerusalem.</span></p> <h3>
