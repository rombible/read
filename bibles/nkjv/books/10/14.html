<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Joab sent to Tekoa and brought from there a wise woman, and said to her, &#8220;Please pretend to be a mourner, and put on mourning apparel; do not anoint yourself with oil, but act like a woman who has been mourning a long time for the dead. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Go to the king and speak to him in this manner.&#8221; So Joab put the words in her mouth.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And when the woman of Tekoa <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground and prostrated herself, and said, &#8220;Help, O king!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then the king said to her, &#8220;What troubles you?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-14-5">And she answered, &#8220;Indeed I <i>am</i> a widow, my husband is dead. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now your maidservant had two sons; and the two fought with each other in the field, and <i>there was</i> no one to part them, but the one struck the other and killed him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And now the whole family has risen up against your maidservant, and they said, &#8216;Deliver him who struck his brother, that we may execute him for the life of his brother whom he killed; and we will destroy the heir also.&#8217; So they would extinguish my ember that is left, and leave to my husband <i>neither</i> name nor remnant on the earth.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then the king said to the woman, &#8220;Go to your house, and I will give orders concerning you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And the woman of Tekoa said to the king, &#8220;My lord, O king, <i>let</i> the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>iniquity <i>be</i> on me and on my father&#8217;s house, and the king and his throne <i>be</i> guiltless.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So the king said, &#8220;Whoever says <i>anything</i> to you, bring him to me, and he shall not touch you anymore.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then she said, &#8220;Please let the king remember the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God, and do not permit the avenger of blood to destroy anymore, lest they destroy my son.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-14-11">And he said, &#8220;<i>As</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> lives, not one hair of your son shall fall to the ground.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Therefore the woman said, &#8220;Please, let your maidservant speak <i>another</i> word to my lord the king.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-14-12">And he said, &#8220;Say on.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So the woman said: &#8220;Why then have you schemed such a thing against the people of God? For the king speaks this thing as one who is guilty, <i>in that</i> the king does not bring his banished one home again. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For we will surely die and <i>become</i> like water spilled on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again. Yet God does not take away a life; but He devises means, so that His banished ones are not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>expelled from Him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Now therefore, I have come to speak of this thing to my lord the king because the people have made me afraid. And your maidservant said, &#8216;I will now speak to the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his maidservant. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>For the king will hear and deliver his maidservant from the hand of the man <i>who would</i> destroy me and my son together from the inheritance of God.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Your maidservant said, &#8216;The word of my lord the king will now be comforting; for as the angel of God, so <i>is</i> my lord the king in discerning good and evil. And may the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God be with you.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then the king answered and said to the woman, &#8220;Please do not hide from me anything that I ask you.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-14-18">And the woman said, &#8220;Please, let my lord the king speak.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>So the king said, &#8220;<i>Is</i> the hand of Joab with you in all this?&#8221; And the woman answered and said, &#8220;<i>As</i> you live, my lord the king, no one can turn to the right hand or to the left from anything that my lord the king has spoken. For your servant Joab commanded me, and he put all these words in the mouth of your maidservant. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>To bring about this change of affairs your servant Joab has done this thing; but my lord <i>is</i> wise, according to the wisdom of the angel of God, to know everything that <i>is</i> in the earth.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And the king said to Joab, &#8220;All right, I have granted this thing. Go therefore, bring back the young man Absalom.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then Joab fell to the ground on his face and bowed himself, and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>thanked the king. And Joab said, &#8220;Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, my lord, O king, in that the king has fulfilled the request of his servant.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And the king said, &#8220;Let him return to his own house, but do not let him see my face.&#8221; So Absalom returned to his own house, but did not see the king&#8217;s face.</span></p> <h3>
David Forgives Absalom</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Sam-14-25"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Now in all Israel there was no one who was praised as much as Absalom for his good looks. From the sole of his foot to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And when he cut the hair of his head&#8212;at the end of every year he cut <i>it</i> because it was heavy on him&#8212;when he cut it, he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels according to the king&#8217;s standard. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>To Absalom were born three sons, and one daughter whose name <i>was</i> Tamar. She was a woman of beautiful appearance.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>And Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, but did not see the king&#8217;s face. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king, but he would not come to him. And when he sent again the second time, he would not come. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>So he said to his servants, &#8220;See, Joab&#8217;s field is near mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire.&#8221; And Absalom&#8217;s servants set the field on fire.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Then Joab arose and came to Absalom&#8217;s house, and said to him, &#8220;Why have your servants set my field on fire?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And Absalom answered Joab, &#8220;Look, I sent to you, saying, &#8216;Come here, so that I may send you to the king, to say, &#8220;Why have I come from Geshur? <i>It would be</i> better for me <i>to be</i> there still.&#8221; &#8217; Now therefore, let me see the king&#8217;s face; but if there is iniquity in me, let him execute me.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>So Joab went to the king and told him. And when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king. Then the king kissed Absalom.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-8361a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 14:4">2 Samuel 14:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Many Heb. mss., LXX, Syr., Vg. <i>came</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8366b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 14:9">2 Samuel 14:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>guilt</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8371c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 14:14">2 Samuel 14:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>cast out</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8379d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 14:22">2 Samuel 14:22</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>blessed</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
