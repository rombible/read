<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And the king said to Ziba, &#8220;What do you mean to do with these?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-16-2">So Ziba said, &#8220;The donkeys <i>are</i> for the king&#8217;s household to ride on, the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat, and the wine for those who are faint in the wilderness to drink.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then the king said, &#8220;And where <i>is</i> your master&#8217;s son?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-16-3">And Ziba said to the king, &#8220;Indeed he is staying in Jerusalem, for he said, &#8216;Today the house of Israel will restore the kingdom of my father to me.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So the king said to Ziba, &#8220;Here, all that <i>belongs</i> to Mephibosheth <i>is</i> yours.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-16-4">And Ziba said, &#8220;I humbly bow before you, <i>that</i> I may find favor in your sight, my lord, O king!&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Shimei Curses David</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Sam-16-5"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now when King David came to Bahurim, there was a man from the family of the house of Saul, whose name <i>was</i> Shimei the son of Gera, coming from there. He came out, cursing continuously as he came. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And he threw stones at David and at all the servants of King David. And all the people and all the mighty men <i>were</i> on his right hand and on his left. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Also Shimei said thus when he cursed: &#8220;Come out! Come out! You <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>bloodthirsty man, you <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>rogue! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has brought upon you all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose place you have reigned; and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom your son. So now you <i>are caught</i> in your own evil, because you are a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>bloodthirsty man!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, &#8220;Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Please, let me go over and take off his head!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>But the king said, &#8220;What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? So let him curse, because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has said to him, &#8216;Curse David.&#8217; Who then shall say, &#8216;Why have you done so?&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And David said to Abishai and all his servants, &#8220;See how my son who came from my own body seeks my life. How much more now <i>may this</i> Benjamite? Let him alone, and let him curse; for so the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has ordered him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>It may be that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will look on <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>my affliction, and that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will repay me with good for his cursing this day.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And as David and his men went along the road, Shimei went along the hillside opposite him and cursed as he went, threw stones at him and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>kicked up dust. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Now the king and all the people who <i>were</i> with him became weary; so they refreshed themselves there.</span></p> <h3>
The Advice of Ahithophel</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Sam-16-15"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Meanwhile Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem; and Ahithophel <i>was</i> with him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And so it was, when Hushai the Archite, David&#8217;s friend, came to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom, &#8220;<i>Long</i> live the king! <i>Long</i> live the king!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So Absalom said to Hushai, &#8220;<i>Is</i> this your loyalty to your friend? Why did you not go with your friend?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And Hushai said to Absalom, &#8220;No, but whom the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and this people and all the men of Israel choose, his I will be, and with him I will remain. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Furthermore, whom should I serve? <i>Should I</i> not <i>serve</i> in the presence of his son? As I have served in your father&#8217;s presence, so will I be in your presence.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, &#8220;Give advice as to what we should do.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And Ahithophel said to Absalom, &#8220;Go in to your father&#8217;s concubines, whom he has left to keep the house; and all Israel will hear that you are abhorred by your father. Then the hands of all who are with you will be strong.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the top of the house, and Absalom went in to his father&#8217;s concubines in the sight of all Israel.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Now the advice of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, <i>was</i> as if one had inquired at the oracle of God. So <i>was</i> all the advice of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-8434a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 16:7">2 Samuel 16:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>man of bloodshed</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8434b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 16:7">2 Samuel 16:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>worthless man</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8435c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 16:8">2 Samuel 16:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>man of bloodshed</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8439d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 16:12">2 Samuel 16:12</span> <span class='footnote-text'>So with Kt., LXX, Syr., Vg.; Qr. <i>my eyes;</i> Tg. <i>tears of my eyes</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8440e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 16:13">2 Samuel 16:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>dusted him with dust</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
