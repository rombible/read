<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Now Saul&#8217;s son <i>had</i> two men <i>who were</i> captains of troops. The name of one <i>was</i> Baanah and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin. (For Beeroth also was <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span><i>part</i> of Benjamin, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>because the Beerothites fled to Gittaim and have been sojourners there until this day.)</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Jonathan, Saul&#8217;s son, had a son <i>who was</i> lame in <i>his</i> feet. He was five years old when the news about Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel; and his nurse took him up and fled. And it happened, as she made haste to flee, that he fell and became lame. His name <i>was</i> Mephibosheth.<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, set out and came at about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who was lying on his bed at noon. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And they came there, all the way into the house, <i>as though</i> to get wheat, and they <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>stabbed him in the stomach. Then Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For when they came into the house, he was lying on his bed in his bedroom; then they struck him and killed him, beheaded him and took his head, and were all night escaping through the plain. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And they brought the head of Ishbosheth to David at Hebron, and said to the king, &#8220;Here is the head of Ishbosheth, the son of Saul your enemy, who sought your life; and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has avenged my lord the king this day of Saul and his descendants.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, &#8220;<i>As</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> lives, who has redeemed my life from all adversity, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>when someone told me, saying, &#8216;Look, Saul is dead,&#8217; thinking to have brought good news, I arrested him and had him executed in Ziklag&#8212;the one who <i>thought</i> I would give him a reward for <i>his</i> news. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>How much more, when wicked men have killed a righteous person in his own house on his bed? Therefore, shall I not now require his <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>blood at your hand and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>remove you from the earth?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So David commanded his young men, and they executed them, cut off their hands and feet, and hanged <i>them</i> by the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth and buried <i>it</i> in the tomb of Abner in Hebron.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-8122a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 4:1">2 Samuel 4:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Ishbosheth</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8122b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 4:1">2 Samuel 4:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>his hands dropped</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8123c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 4:2">2 Samuel 4:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>considered part of</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8125d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 4:4">2 Samuel 4:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Merib-Baal,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="1Chr.8.34" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=1Chr.8.34&amp;version=NKJV">1 Chr. 8:34</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="1Chr.9.40" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=1Chr.9.40&amp;version=NKJV">9:40</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8127e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 4:6">2 Samuel 4:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>struck</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8132f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 4:11">2 Samuel 4:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>bloodshed</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8132g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 4:11">2 Samuel 4:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>consume you</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
