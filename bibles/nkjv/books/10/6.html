<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And David arose and went with all the people who <i>were</i> with him from <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>Baale Judah to bring up from there the ark of God, whose name is called <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>by the Name, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> of Hosts, who dwells <i>between</i> the cherubim. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So they set the ark of God on a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which <i>was</i> on the hill; and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>cart. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which <i>was</i> on the hill, accompanying the ark of God; and Ahio went before the ark. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then David and all the house of Israel played <i>music</i> before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> on all kinds of <i>instruments of</i> fir wood, on harps, on stringed instruments, on tambourines, on sistrums, and on cymbals.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And when they came to Nachon&#8217;s threshing floor, Uzzah put out <i>his</i> <i>hand</i> to the ark of God and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>took hold of it, for the oxen stumbled. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then the anger of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was aroused against Uzzah, and God struck him there for <i>his</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>error; and he died there by the ark of God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And David became angry because of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s outbreak against Uzzah; and he called the name of the place <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>Perez Uzzah to this day.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>David was afraid of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> that day; and he said, &#8220;How can the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> come to me?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So David would not move the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> with him into the City of David; but David took it aside into the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>The ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> remained in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite three months. And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> blessed Obed-Edom and all his household.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now it was told King David, saying, &#8220;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has blessed the house of Obed-Edom and all that <i>belongs</i> to him, because of the ark of God.&#8221; So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-Edom to the City of David with gladness. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And so it was, when those bearing the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had gone six paces, that he sacrificed oxen and fatted sheep. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then David danced<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span> before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> with all <i>his</i> might; and David <i>was</i> wearing a linen ephod. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> with shouting and with the sound of the trumpet.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Now as the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came into the City of David, Michal, Saul&#8217;s daughter, looked through a window and saw King David leaping and whirling before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; and she despised him in her heart. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So they brought the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and set it in its place in the midst of the tabernacle that David had erected for it. Then David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And when David had finished offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then he distributed among all the people, among the whole multitude of Israel, both the women and the men, to everyone a loaf of bread, a piece <i>of meat,</i> and a cake of raisins. So all the people departed, everyone to his house.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, &#8220;How glorious was the king of Israel today, uncovering himself today in the eyes of the maids of his servants, as one of the base fellows <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>shamelessly uncovers himself!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>So David said to Michal, &#8220;<i>It was</i> before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, who chose me instead of your father and all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, over Israel. Therefore I will play <i>music</i> before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And I will be even more undignified than this, and will be humble in my own sight. But as for the maidservants of whom you have spoken, by them I will be held in honor.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no children to the day of her death.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-8160a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 6:2">2 Samuel 6:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Baalah, Kirjath Jearim,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Josh.15.9" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=Josh.15.9&amp;version=NKJV">Josh. 15:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="1Chr.13.6" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=1Chr.13.6&amp;version=NKJV">1 Chr. 13:6</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8160b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 6:2">2 Samuel 6:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'>LXX, Tg., Vg. omit <i>by the Name;</i> many Heb. mss., Syr. <i>there</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8161c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 6:3">2 Samuel 6:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>LXX adds <i>with the ark</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8164d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 6:6">2 Samuel 6:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>held it</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8165e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 6:7">2 Samuel 6:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>irreverence</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8166f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 6:8">2 Samuel 6:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Outburst Against Uzzah</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8172g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 6:14">2 Samuel 6:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>whirled about</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8178h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 6:20">2 Samuel 6:20</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>openly</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
