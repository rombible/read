<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>I will come upon him while he <i>is</i> weary and weak, and make him <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>afraid. And all the people who <i>are</i> with him will flee, and I will strike only the king. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then I will bring back all the people to you. When all return except the man whom you seek, all the people will be at peace.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And the saying pleased Absalom and all the elders of Israel.</span></p> <h3>
The Advice of Hushai</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Sam-17-5"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then Absalom said, &#8220;Now call Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear what he says too.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And when Hushai came to Absalom, Absalom spoke to him, saying, &#8220;Ahithophel has spoken in this manner. Shall we do as he says? If not, speak up.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So Hushai said to Absalom: &#8220;The advice that Ahithophel has given <i>is</i> not good at this time. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For,&#8221; said Hushai, &#8220;you know your father and his men, that they <i>are</i> mighty men, and they <i>are</i> enraged in their minds, like a bear robbed of her cubs in the field; and your father <i>is</i> a man of war, and will not camp with the people. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Surely by now he is hidden in some pit, or in some <i>other</i> place. And it will be, when some of them are overthrown at the first, that whoever hears <i>it</i> will say, &#8216;There is a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And even he <i>who is</i> valiant, whose heart <i>is</i> like the heart of a lion, will melt completely. For all Israel knows that your father <i>is</i> a mighty man, and <i>those</i> who <i>are</i> with him <i>are</i> valiant men. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Therefore I advise that all Israel be fully gathered to you, from Dan to Beersheba, like the sand that <i>is</i> by the sea for multitude, and that you go to battle in person. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So we will come upon him in some place where he may be found, and we will fall on him as the dew falls on the ground. And of him and all the men who <i>are</i> with him there shall not be left so much as one. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Moreover, if he has withdrawn into a city, then all Israel shall bring ropes to that city; and we will pull it into the river, until there is not one small stone found there.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So Absalom and all the men of Israel said, &#8220;The advice of Hushai the Archite <i>is</i> better than the advice of Ahithophel.&#8221; For the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> had purposed to defeat the good advice of Ahithophel, to the intent that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> might bring disaster on Absalom.</span></p> <h3>
Hushai Warns David to Escape</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Sam-17-15"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then Hushai said to Zadok and Abiathar the priests, &#8220;Thus and so Ahithophel advised Absalom and the elders of Israel, and thus and so I have advised. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Now therefore, send quickly and tell David, saying, &#8216;Do not spend this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily cross over, lest the king and all the people who <i>are</i> with him be swallowed up.&#8217; &#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed at En Rogel, for they dared not be seen coming into the city; so a female servant would come and tell them, and they would go and tell King David. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom. But both of them went away quickly and came to a man&#8217;s house in Bahurim, who had a well in his court; and they went down into it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then the woman took and spread a covering over the well&#8217;s mouth, and spread ground grain on it; and the thing was not known. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And when Absalom&#8217;s servants came to the woman at the house, they said, &#8220;Where <i>are</i> Ahimaaz and Jonathan?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-17-20">So the woman said to them, &#8220;They have gone over the water brook.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-17-20">And when they had searched and could not find <i>them,</i> they returned to Jerusalem. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Now it came to pass, after they had departed, that they came up out of the well and went and told King David, and said to David, &#8220;Arise and cross over the water quickly. For thus has Ahithophel advised against you.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So David and all the people who <i>were</i> with him arose and crossed over the Jordan. By morning light not one of them was left who had not gone over the Jordan.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice was not followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house, to his city. Then he <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died; and he was buried in his father&#8217;s tomb.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then David went to Mahanaim. And Absalom crossed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And Absalom made Amasa captain of the army instead of Joab. This Amasa <i>was</i> the son of a man whose name <i>was</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Jithra, an <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>Israelite, who had gone in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister of Zeruiah, Joab&#8217;s mother. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>So Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Now it happened, when David had come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash from Rabbah of the people of Ammon, Machir the son of Ammiel from Lo Debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>brought beds and basins, earthen vessels and wheat, barley and flour, parched <i>grain</i> and beans, lentils and parched <i>seeds,</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>honey and curds, sheep and cheese of the herd, for David and the people who <i>were</i> with him to eat. For they said, &#8220;The people are hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness.&#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-8452a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 17:2">2 Samuel 17:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>tremble with fear</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8473b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 17:23">2 Samuel 17:23</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>gave charge concerning his house</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8475c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 17:25">2 Samuel 17:25</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Jether,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="1Chr.2.17" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=1Chr.2.17&amp;version=NKJV">1 Chr. 2:17</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8475d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 17:25">2 Samuel 17:25</span> <span class='footnote-text'>So with MT, some LXX mss., Tg.; some LXX mss. <i>Ishmaelite</i> (cf. <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="1Chr.2.17" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=1Chr.2.17&amp;version=NKJV">1 Chr. 2:17</span>); Vg. <i>of Jezrael</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
