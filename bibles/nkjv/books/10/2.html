<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So David went up there, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And David brought up the men who <i>were</i> with him, every man with his household. So they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, &#8220;The men of Jabesh Gilead <i>were the ones</i> who buried Saul.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead, and said to them, &#8220;You <i>are</i> blessed of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, for you have shown this kindness to your lord, to Saul, and have buried him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And now may the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> show kindness and truth to you. I also will repay you this kindness, because you have done this thing. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now therefore, let your hands be strengthened, and be valiant; for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah has anointed me king over them.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Ishbosheth Made King of Israel</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Sam-2-8"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But Abner the son of Ner, commander of Saul&#8217;s army, took <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>Ishbosheth the son of Saul and brought him over to Mahanaim; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and he made him king over Gilead, over the Ashurites, over Jezreel, over Ephraim, over Benjamin, and over all Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Ishbosheth, Saul&#8217;s son, <i>was</i> forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. Only the house of Judah followed David. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.</span></p> <h3>
Israel and Judah at War</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Sam-2-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out and met them by the pool of Gibeon. So they sat down, one on one side of the pool and the other on the other side of the pool. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then Abner said to Joab, &#8220;Let the young men now arise and compete before us.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-2-14">And Joab said, &#8220;Let them arise.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So they arose and went over by number, twelve from Benjamin, <i>followers</i> of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve from the servants of David. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And each one grasped his opponent by the head and <i>thrust</i> his sword in his opponent&#8217;s side; so they fell down together. Therefore that place was called <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>the Field of Sharp Swords, which <i>is</i> in Gibeon. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So there was a very fierce battle that day, and Abner and the men of Israel were beaten before the servants of David.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Now the three sons of Zeruiah were there: Joab and Abishai and Asahel. And Asahel <i>was</i> <i>as</i> fleet of foot as a wild gazelle. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>So Asahel pursued Abner, and in going he did not turn to the right hand or to the left from following Abner.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then Abner looked behind him and said, &#8220;<i>Are</i> you Asahel?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-2-20">He answered, &#8220;I <i>am.</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And Abner said to him, &#8220;Turn aside to your right hand or to your left, and lay hold on one of the young men and take his armor for yourself.&#8221; But Asahel would not turn aside from following him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So Abner said again to Asahel, &#8220;Turn aside from following me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then could I face your brother Joab?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>However, he refused to turn aside. Therefore Abner struck him in the stomach with the blunt end of the spear, so that the spear came out of his back; and he fell down there and died on the spot. So it was <i>that</i> as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died, stood still.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Joab and Abishai also pursued Abner. And the sun was going down when they came to the hill of Ammah, which <i>is</i> before Giah by the road to the Wilderness of Gibeon. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Now the children of Benjamin gathered together behind Abner and became <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>a unit, and took their stand on top of a hill. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Then Abner called to Joab and said, &#8220;Shall the sword devour forever? Do you not know that it will be bitter in the latter end? How long will it be then until you tell the people to return from pursuing their brethren?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And Joab said, &#8220;<i>As</i> God lives, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>unless you had spoken, surely then by morning all the people would have given up pursuing their brethren.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>So Joab blew a trumpet; and all the people stood still and did not pursue Israel anymore, nor did they fight anymore. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Then Abner and his men went on all that night through the plain, crossed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron; and they came to Mahanaim.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>So Joab returned from pursuing Abner. And when he had gathered all the people together, there were missing of David&#8217;s servants nineteen men and Asahel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>But the servants of David had struck down, of Benjamin and Abner&#8217;s men, three hundred and sixty men who died. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Then they took up Asahel and buried him in his father&#8217;s tomb, which <i>was in</i> Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at daybreak.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-8058a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 2:8">2 Samuel 2:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Esh-Baal,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="1Chr.8.33" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=1Chr.8.33&amp;version=NKJV">1 Chr. 8:33</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="1Chr.9.39" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=1Chr.9.39&amp;version=NKJV">9:39</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8061b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 2:11">2 Samuel 2:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>number of days</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8066c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 2:16">2 Samuel 2:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. <i>Helkath Hazzurim</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8075d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 2:25">2 Samuel 2:25</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>one band</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8077e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 2:27">2 Samuel 2:27</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>if you had not spoken</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
