<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Amnon was so distressed over his sister Tamar that he became sick; for she <i>was</i> a virgin. And it was improper for Amnon to do anything to her. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But Amnon had a friend whose name <i>was</i> Jonadab the son of Shimeah, David&#8217;s brother. Now Jonadab <i>was</i> a very crafty man. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And he said to him, &#8220;Why <i>are</i> you, the king&#8217;s son, becoming thinner day after day? Will you not tell me?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-13-4">Amnon said to him, &#8220;I love Tamar, my brother Absalom&#8217;s sister.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So Jonadab said to him, &#8220;Lie down on your bed and pretend to be ill. And when your father comes to see you, say to him, &#8216;Please let my sister Tamar come and give me food, and prepare the food in my sight, that I may see <i>it</i> and eat it from her hand.&#8217; &#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill; and when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, &#8220;Please let Tamar my sister come and make a couple of cakes for me in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And David sent home to Tamar, saying, &#8220;Now go to your brother Amnon&#8217;s house, and prepare food for him.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So Tamar went to her brother Amnon&#8217;s house; and he was lying down. Then she took flour and kneaded <i>it,</i> made cakes in his sight, and baked the cakes. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And she took the pan and placed <i>them</i> out before him, but he refused to eat. Then Amnon said, &#8220;Have everyone go out from me.&#8221; And they all went out from him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then Amnon said to Tamar, &#8220;Bring the food into the bedroom, that I may eat from your hand.&#8221; And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought <i>them</i> to Amnon her brother in the bedroom. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now when she had brought <i>them</i> to him to eat, he took hold of her and said to her, &#8220;Come, lie with me, my sister.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But she answered him, &#8220;No, my brother, do not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>force me, for no such thing should be done in Israel. Do not do this disgraceful thing! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And I, where could I take my shame? And as for you, you would be like one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, please speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from you.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>However, he would not heed her voice; and being stronger than she, he forced her and lay with her.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then Amnon hated her <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>exceedingly, so that the hatred with which he hated her <i>was</i> greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, &#8220;Arise, be gone!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So she said to him, &#8220;No, indeed! This evil of sending me away <i>is</i> worse than the other that you did to me.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-13-16">But he would not listen to her. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then he called his servant who attended him, and said, &#8220;Here! Put this <i>woman</i> out, away from me, and bolt the door behind her.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Now she had on a robe of many colors, for the king&#8217;s virgin daughters wore such apparel. And his servant put her out and bolted the door behind her.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then Tamar put ashes on her head, and tore her robe of many colors that <i>was</i> on her, and laid her hand on her head and went away crying bitterly. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And Absalom her brother said to her, &#8220;Has Amnon your brother been with you? But now hold your peace, my sister. He <i>is</i> your brother; do not take this thing to heart.&#8221; So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom&#8217;s house.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>But when King David heard of all these things, he was very angry. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And Absalom spoke to his brother Amnon neither good nor bad. For Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.</span></p> <h3>
Absalom Murders Amnon</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Sam-13-23"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And it came to pass, after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal Hazor, which <i>is</i> near Ephraim; so Absalom invited all the king&#8217;s sons. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then Absalom came to the king and said, &#8220;Kindly note, your servant has sheepshearers; please, let the king and his servants go with your servant.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>But the king said to Absalom, &#8220;No, my son, let us not all go now, lest we be a burden to you.&#8221; Then he urged him, but he would not go; and he blessed him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Then Absalom said, &#8220;If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-13-26">And the king said to him, &#8220;Why should he go with you?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>But Absalom urged him; so he let Amnon and all the king&#8217;s sons go with him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, &#8220;Watch now, when Amnon&#8217;s heart is merry with wine, and when I say to you, &#8216;Strike Amnon!&#8217; then kill him. Do not be afraid. Have I not commanded you? Be courageous and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>valiant.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>So the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king&#8217;s sons arose, and each one got on his mule and fled.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And it came to pass, while they were on the way, that news came to David, saying, &#8220;Absalom has killed all the king&#8217;s sons, and not one of them is left!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>So the king arose and tore his garments and lay on the ground, and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Then Jonadab the son of Shimeah, David&#8217;s brother, answered and said, &#8220;Let not my lord suppose they have killed all the young men, the king&#8217;s sons, for only Amnon is dead. For by the command of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Now therefore, let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king&#8217;s sons are dead. For only Amnon is dead.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Absalom Flees to Geshur</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Sam-13-34"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Then Absalom fled. And the young man who was keeping watch lifted his eyes and looked, and there, many people were coming from the road on the hillside behind <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>And Jonadab said to the king, &#8220;Look, the king&#8217;s sons are coming; as your servant said, so it is.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>So it was, as soon as he had finished speaking, that the king&#8217;s sons indeed came, and they lifted up their voice and wept. Also the king and all his servants wept very bitterly.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>But Absalom fled and went to Talmai the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And <i>David</i> mourned for his son every day. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>So Absalom fled and went to Geshur, and was there three years. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>And <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>King David <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>longed to go to Absalom.
