And he came to him, and said to him: &#8220;There were two men in one city, one rich and the other poor. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>The rich <i>man</i> had exceedingly many flocks and herds. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But the poor <i>man</i> had nothing, except one little ewe lamb which he had bought and nourished; and it grew up together with him and with his children. It ate of his own food and drank from his own cup and lay in his bosom; and it was like a daughter to him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And a traveler came to the rich man, who refused to take from his own flock and from his own herd to prepare one for the wayfaring man who had come to him; but he took the poor man&#8217;s lamb and prepared it for the man who had come to him.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So David&#8217;s anger was greatly aroused against the man, and he said to Nathan, &#8220;<i>As</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> lives, the man who has done this <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>shall surely die! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And he shall restore fourfold for the lamb, because he did this thing and because he had no pity.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then Nathan said to David, &#8220;You <i>are</i> the man! Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God of Israel: &#8216;I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you from the hand of Saul. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>I gave you your master&#8217;s house and your master&#8217;s wives into your keeping, and gave you the house of Israel and Judah. And if <i>that had been</i> too little, I also would have given you much more! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Why have you despised the commandment of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, to do evil in His sight? You have killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword; you have taken his wife <i>to be</i> your wife, and have killed him with the sword of the people of Ammon. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Now therefore, the sword shall never depart from your house, because you have despised Me, and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8216;Behold, I will raise up adversity against you from your own house; and I will take your wives before your eyes and give <i>them</i> to your neighbor, and he shall lie with your wives in the sight of this sun. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>For you did <i>it</i> secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel, before the sun.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So David said to Nathan, &#8220;I have sinned against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-12-13">And Nathan said to David, &#8220;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> also has put away your sin; you shall not die. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>However, because by this deed you have given great occasion to the enemies of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> to blaspheme, the child also <i>who is</i> born to you shall surely die.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then Nathan departed to his house.</span></p><h3><span class="text 2Sam-12-15">The Death of David&#8217;s Son</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Sam-12-15">And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> struck the child that Uriah&#8217;s wife bore to David, and it became ill. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>David therefore pleaded with God for the child, and David fasted and went in and lay all night on the ground. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So the elders of his house arose <i>and went</i> to him, to raise him up from the ground. But he would not, nor did he eat food with them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then on the seventh day it came to pass that the child died. And the servants of David were afraid to tell him that the child was dead. For they said, &#8220;Indeed, while the child was alive, we spoke to him, and he would not heed our voice. How can we tell him that the child is dead? He may do some harm!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>When David saw that his servants were whispering, David perceived that the child was dead. Therefore David said to his servants, &#8220;Is the child dead?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-12-19">And they said, &#8220;He is dead.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So David arose from the ground, washed and anointed himself, and changed his clothes; and he went into the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and worshiped. Then he went to his own house; and when he requested, they set food before him, and he ate. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then his servants said to him, &#8220;What <i>is</i> this that you have done? You fasted and wept for the child <i>while he was</i> alive, but when the child died, you arose and ate food.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;While the child was alive, I fasted and wept; for I said, &#8216;Who can tell <i>whether</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> will be gracious to me, that the child may live?&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>But now he is dead; why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
Solomon Is Born</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Sam-12-24"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in to her and lay with her. So she bore a son, and he<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> called his name Solomon. Now the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> loved him, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>and He sent <i>word</i> by the hand of Nathan the prophet: So <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>he called his name <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>Jedidiah, because of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>.</span></p> <h3>
Rabbah Is Captured</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Sam-12-26"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the people of Ammon, and took the royal city. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, &#8220;I have fought against Rabbah, and I have taken the city&#8217;s water <i>supply.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Now therefore, gather the rest of the people together and encamp against the city and take it, lest I take the city and it be called after my name.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>So David gathered all the people together and went to Rabbah, fought against it, and took it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Then he took their king&#8217;s crown from his head. Its weight <i>was</i> a talent of gold, with precious stones. And it was <i>set</i> on David&#8217;s head. Also he brought out the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>spoil of the city in great abundance. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>And he brought out the people who <i>were</i> in it, and put <i>them to work</i> with saws and iron picks and iron axes, and made them cross over to the brick works. So he did to all the cities of the people of Ammon. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-8292a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 12:5">2 Samuel 12:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>deserves to die,</i> lit. <i>is a son of death</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8309b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 12:22">2 Samuel 12:22</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. mss., Syr. <i>God</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8311c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 12:24">2 Samuel 12:24</span> <span class='footnote-text'>So with Kt., LXX, Vg.; Qr., a few Heb. mss., Syr., Tg. <i>she</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8312d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 12:25">2 Samuel 12:25</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Qr., some Heb. mss., Syr., Tg. <i>she</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8312e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 12:25">2 Samuel 12:25</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>Beloved of the <span class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span></i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8317f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 12:30">2 Samuel 12:30</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>plunder</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
