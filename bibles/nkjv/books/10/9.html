<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And <i>there was</i> a servant of the house of Saul whose name <i>was</i> Ziba. So when they had called him to David, the king said to him, &#8220;<i>Are</i> you Ziba?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-9-2">He said, &#8220;At your service!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then the king said, &#8220;<i>Is</i> there not still someone of the house of Saul, to whom I may show the kindness of God?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-9-3">And Ziba said to the king, &#8220;There is still a son of Jonathan <i>who is</i> lame in <i>his</i> feet.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So the king said to him, &#8220;Where <i>is</i> he?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-9-4">And Ziba said to the king, &#8220;Indeed he <i>is</i> in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, in Lo Debar.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then King David sent and brought him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo Debar.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now when Mephibosheth<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span> the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, had come to David, he fell on his face and prostrated himself. Then David said, &#8220;Mephibosheth?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-9-6">And he answered, &#8220;Here is your servant!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So David said to him, &#8220;Do not fear, for I will surely show you kindness for Jonathan your father&#8217;s sake, and will restore to you all the land of Saul your grandfather; and you shall eat bread at my table continually.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then he bowed himself, and said, &#8220;What <i>is</i> your servant, that you should look upon such a dead dog as I?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And the king called to Ziba, Saul&#8217;s servant, and said to him, &#8220;I have given to your master&#8217;s son all that belonged to Saul and to all his house. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>You therefore, and your sons and your servants, shall work the land for him, and you shall bring in <i>the harvest,</i> that your master&#8217;s son may have food to eat. But Mephibosheth your master&#8217;s son shall eat bread at my table always.&#8221; Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then Ziba said to the king, &#8220;According to all that my lord the king has commanded his servant, so will your servant do.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-9-11">&#8220;As for Mephibosheth,&#8221; <i>said the king,</i> &#8220;he shall eat at <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>my table like one of the king&#8217;s sons.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Mephibosheth had a young son whose name <i>was</i> Micha. And all who dwelt in the house of Ziba <i>were</i> servants of Mephibosheth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem, for he ate continually at the king&#8217;s table. And he was lame in both his feet.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-8229a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 9:1">2 Samuel 9:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>covenant faithfulness</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8234b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 9:6">2 Samuel 9:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>Merib-Baal</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8239c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 9:11">2 Samuel 9:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>LXX <i>David&#8217;s table</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
