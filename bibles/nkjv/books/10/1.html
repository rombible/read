<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>on the third day, behold, it happened that a man came from Saul&#8217;s camp with his clothes <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>torn and dust on his head. So it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the ground and prostrated himself.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And David said to him, &#8220;Where have you come from?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-1-3">So he said to him, &#8220;I have escaped from the camp of Israel.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then David said to him, &#8220;How did the matter go? Please tell me.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-1-4">And he answered, &#8220;The people have fled from the battle, many of the people are fallen and dead, and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So David said to the young man who told him, &#8220;How do you know that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then the young man who told him said, &#8220;As I happened by chance <i>to be</i> on Mount Gilboa, there was Saul, leaning on his spear; and indeed the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now when he looked behind him, he saw me and called to me. And I answered, &#8216;Here I am.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And he said to me, &#8216;Who <i>are</i> you?&#8217; So I answered him, &#8216;I <i>am</i> an Amalekite.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>He said to me again, &#8216;Please stand over me and kill me, for <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>anguish has come upon me, but my life still <i>remains</i> in me.&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So I stood over him and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after he had fallen. And I took the crown that <i>was</i> on his head and the bracelet that <i>was</i> on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Therefore David took hold of his own clothes and tore them, and <i>so did</i> all the men who <i>were</i> with him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And they mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and for Jonathan his son, for the people of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> and for the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then David said to the young man who told him, &#8220;Where <i>are</i> you from?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-1-13">And he answered, &#8220;I <i>am</i> the son of an alien, an Amalekite.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So David said to him, &#8220;How was it you were not afraid to put forth your hand to destroy the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s anointed?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then David called one of the young men and said, &#8220;Go near, <i>and</i> execute him!&#8221; And he struck him so that he died. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So David said to him, &#8220;Your blood <i>is</i> on your own head, for your own mouth has testified against you, saying, &#8216;I have killed the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s anointed.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <h3>
The Song of the Bow</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Sam-1-17"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son, </span>
