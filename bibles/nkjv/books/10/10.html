<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then David said, &#8220;I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father showed kindness to me.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-10-2">So David sent by the hand of his servants to comfort him concerning his father. And David&#8217;s servants came into the land of the people of Ammon. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And the princes of the people of Ammon said to Hanun their lord, &#8220;Do you think that David really honors your father because he has sent comforters to you? Has David not <i>rather</i> sent his servants to you to search the city, to spy it out, and to overthrow it?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Therefore Hanun took David&#8217;s servants, shaved off half of their beards, cut off their garments in the middle, at their buttocks, and sent them away. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>When they told David, he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>ashamed. And the king said, &#8220;Wait at Jericho until your beards have grown, and <i>then</i> return.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>When the people of Ammon saw that they had made themselves repulsive to David, the people of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth Rehob and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand foot soldiers; and from the king of Maacah one thousand men, and from Ish-Tob twelve thousand men. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now when David heard <i>of it,</i> he sent Joab and all the army of the mighty men. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then the people of Ammon came out and put themselves in battle array at the entrance of the gate. And the Syrians of Zoba, Beth Rehob, Ish-Tob, and Maacah <i>were</i> by themselves in the field.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>When Joab saw that the battle line was against him before and behind, he chose some of Israel&#8217;s best and put <i>them</i> in battle array against the Syrians. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And the rest of the people he put under the command of Abishai his brother, that he might set <i>them</i> in battle array against the people of Ammon. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then he said, &#8220;If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the people of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will come and help you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Be of good courage, and let us be strong for our people and for the cities of our God. And may the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> do <i>what is</i> good in His sight.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So Joab and the people who <i>were</i> with him drew near for the battle against the Syrians, and they fled before him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>When the people of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fleeing, they also fled before Abishai, and entered the city. So Joab returned from the people of Ammon and went to Jerusalem.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>When the Syrians saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they gathered together. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>Hadadezer sent and brought out the Syrians who <i>were</i> beyond <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>the River, and they came to Helam. And <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>Shobach the commander of Hadadezer&#8217;s army <i>went</i> before them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>When it was told David, he gathered all Israel, crossed over the Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in battle array against David and fought with him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then the Syrians fled before Israel; and David killed seven hundred charioteers and forty thousand horsemen of the Syrians, and struck Shobach the commander of their army, who died there. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And when all the kings <i>who were</i> servants to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>Hadadezer saw that they were defeated by Israel, they made peace with Israel and served them. So the Syrians were afraid to help the people of Ammon anymore.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-8246a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 10:5">2 Samuel 10:5</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>humiliated</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8257b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 10:16">2 Samuel 10:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. <i>Hadarezer</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8257c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 10:16">2 Samuel 10:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>The Euphrates</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8257d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 10:16">2 Samuel 10:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Shophach,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="1Chr.19.16" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=1Chr.19.16&amp;version=NKJV">1 Chr. 19:16</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8260e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 10:19">2 Samuel 10:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Heb. <i>Hadarezer</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
