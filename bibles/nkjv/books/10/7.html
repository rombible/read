<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>that the king said to Nathan the prophet, &#8220;See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells inside tent curtains.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then Nathan said to the king, &#8220;Go, do all that <i>is</i> in your heart, for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <i>is</i> with you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But it happened that night that the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came to Nathan, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8220;Go and tell My servant David, &#8216;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8220;Would you build a house for Me to dwell in? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>For I have not dwelt in a house since the time that I brought the children of Israel up from Egypt, even to this day, but have moved about in a tent and in a tabernacle. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Wherever I have moved about with all the children of Israel, have I ever spoken a word to anyone from the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd My people Israel, saying, &#8216;Why have you not built Me a house of cedar?&#8217; &#8221; &#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Now therefore, thus shall you say to My servant David, &#8216;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts: &#8220;I took you from the sheepfold, from following the sheep, to be ruler over My people, over Israel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>cut off all your enemies from before you, and have made you a great name, like the name of the great men who <i>are</i> on the earth. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Moreover I will appoint a place for My people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own and move no more; nor shall the sons of wickedness oppress them anymore, as previously, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>since the time that I commanded judges <i>to be</i> over My people Israel, and have caused you to rest from all your enemies. Also the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>tells you that He will make you a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>house.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>&#8220;When your days are fulfilled and you rest with your fathers, I will set up your seed after you, who will come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>He shall build a house for My name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>I will be his Father, and he shall be My son. If he commits iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men and with the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>blows of the sons of men. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But My mercy shall not depart from him, as I took <i>it</i> from Saul, whom I removed from before you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And your house and your kingdom shall be established forever before <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>you. Your throne shall be established forever.&#8221; &#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>According to all these words and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.</span></p> <h3>
David&#8217;s Thanksgiving to God</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Sam-7-18"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then King David went in and sat before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>; and he said: &#8220;Who <i>am</i> I, O Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>? And what is my house, that You have brought me this far? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And yet this was a small thing in Your sight, O Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>; and You have also spoken of Your servant&#8217;s house for a great while to come. <i>Is</i> this the manner of man, O Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Now what more can David say to You? For You, Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>, know Your servant. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>For Your word&#8217;s sake, and according to Your own heart, You have done all these great things, to make Your servant know <i>them.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Therefore You are great, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>O Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>. For <i>there is</i> none like You, nor <i>is there any</i> God besides You, according to all that we have heard with our ears. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And who <i>is</i> like Your people, like Israel, the one nation on the earth whom God went to redeem for Himself as a people, to make for Himself a name&#8212;and to do for Yourself great and awesome deeds for Your land&#8212;before Your people whom You redeemed for Yourself from Egypt, the nations, and their gods? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>For You have made Your people Israel Your very own people forever; and You, <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, have become their God.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>&#8220;Now, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> God, the word which You have spoken concerning Your servant and concerning his house, establish <i>it</i> forever and do as You have said. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>So let Your name be magnified forever, saying, &#8216;The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts <i>is</i> the God over Israel.&#8217; And let the house of Your servant David be established before You. </span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>&#8220;And now, O Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">God</span>, You are God, and Your words are true, and You have promised this goodness to Your servant. </span>
