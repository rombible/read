And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> answered, &#8220;<i>It is</i> because of Saul and <i>his</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>bloodthirsty house, because he killed the Gibeonites.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So the king called the Gibeonites and spoke to them. Now the Gibeonites <i>were</i> not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; the children of Israel had sworn protection to them, but Saul had sought to kill them in his zeal for the children of Israel and Judah.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Therefore David said to the Gibeonites, &#8220;What shall I do for you? And with what shall I make atonement, that you may bless the inheritance of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And the Gibeonites said to him, &#8220;We will have no silver or gold from Saul or from his house, nor shall you kill any man in Israel for us.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-21-4">So he said, &#8220;Whatever you say, I will do for you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then they answered the king, &#8220;As for the man who consumed us and plotted against us, <i>that</i> we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the territories of Israel, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>let seven men of his descendants be delivered to us, and we will hang them before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> in Gibeah of Saul, <i>whom</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> chose.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-21-6">And the king said, &#8220;I will give <i>them.</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But the king spared Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, because of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>&#8217;s oath that <i>was</i> between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So the king took Armoni and Mephibosheth, the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, and the five sons of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them on the hill before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>. So they fell, <i>all</i> seven together, and were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first <i>days,</i> in the beginning of barley harvest.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Now Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it for herself on the rock, from the beginning of harvest until the late rains poured on them from heaven. And she did not allow the birds of the air to rest on them by day nor the beasts of the field by night.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And David was told what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then David went and took the bones of Saul, and the bones of Jonathan his son, from the men of Jabesh Gilead who had stolen them from the street of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>Beth Shan, where the Philistines had hung them up, after the Philistines had struck down Saul in Gilboa. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So he brought up the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from there; and they gathered the bones of those who had been hanged. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>They buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the tomb of Kish his father. So they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God heeded the prayer for the land.</span></p> <h3>
Philistine Giants Destroyed</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Sam-21-15"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>When the Philistines were at war again with Israel, David and his servants with him went down and fought against the Philistines; and David grew faint. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then Ishbi-Benob, who <i>was</i> one of the sons of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>the giant, the weight of whose bronze spear <i>was</i> three hundred <i>shekels,</i> who was bearing a new <i>sword,</i> thought he could kill David. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But Abishai the son of Zeruiah came to his aid, and struck the Philistine and killed him. Then the men of David swore to him, saying, &#8220;You shall go out no more with us to battle, lest you quench the lamp of Israel.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Now it happened afterward that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob. Then Sibbechai the Hushathite killed <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>Saph, who <i>was</i> one of the sons of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>the giant. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Again there was war at Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>Jaare-Oregim the Bethlehemite killed <i>the brother of</i> Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear <i>was</i> like a weaver&#8217;s beam.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Yet again there was war at Gath, where there was a man of <i>great</i> stature, who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in number; and he also was born to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>the giant. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>So when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>Shimea, David&#8217;s brother, killed him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>These four were born to <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[k]</a></span>the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-8582a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 21:1">2 Samuel 21:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>house of bloodshed</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8589b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 21:8">2 Samuel 21:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Merab,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="1Sam.18.19" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=1Sam.18.19&amp;version=NKJV">1 Sam. 18:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="1Sam.25.44" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=1Sam.25.44&amp;version=NKJV">25:44</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Sam.3.14" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Sam.3.14&amp;version=NKJV">2 Sam. 3:14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="2Sam.6.23" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=2Sam.6.23&amp;version=NKJV">6:23</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8589c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 21:8">2 Samuel 21:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>bore to Adriel</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8593d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 21:12">2 Samuel 21:12</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Beth Shean,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Josh.17.11" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=Josh.17.11&amp;version=NKJV">Josh. 17:11</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8597e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 21:16">2 Samuel 21:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>Rapha</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8599f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 21:18">2 Samuel 21:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Sippai,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="1Chr.20.4" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=1Chr.20.4&amp;version=NKJV">1 Chr. 20:4</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8599g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 21:18">2 Samuel 21:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>Rapha</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8600h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 21:19">2 Samuel 21:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Jair,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="1Chr.20.5" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=1Chr.20.5&amp;version=NKJV">1 Chr. 20:5</span></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8601i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 21:20">2 Samuel 21:20</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>Rapha</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8602j"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 21:21">2 Samuel 21:21</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Shammah,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="1Sam.16.9" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=1Sam.16.9&amp;version=NKJV">1 Sam. 16:9</span> and elsewhere</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8603k"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 21:22">2 Samuel 21:22</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>Rapha</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
