<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So the king said to Joab the commander of the army who <i>was</i> with him, &#8220;Now go throughout all the tribes of Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, and count the people, that I may know the number of the people.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And Joab said to the king, &#8220;Now may the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God add to the people a hundred times more than there are, and may the eyes of my lord the king see <i>it.</i> But why does my lord the king desire this thing?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Nevertheless the king&#8217;s word <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>prevailed against Joab and against the captains of the army. Therefore Joab and the captains of the army went out from the presence of the king to count the people of Israel.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And they crossed over the Jordan and camped in Aroer, on the right side of the town which <i>is</i> in the midst of the ravine of Gad, and toward Jazer. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then they came to Gilead and to the land of Tahtim Hodshi; they came to Dan Jaan and around to Sidon; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and they came to the stronghold of Tyre and to all the cities of the Hivites and the Canaanites. Then they went out to South Judah <i>as far as</i> Beersheba. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then Joab gave the sum of the number of the people to the king. And there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword, and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.</span></p> <h3>
The Judgment on David&#8217;s Sin</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Sam-24-10"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And David&#8217;s heart condemned him after he had numbered the people. So David said to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, &#8220;I have sinned greatly in what I have done; but now, I pray, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, take away the iniquity of Your servant, for I have done very foolishly.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now when David arose in the morning, the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> came to the prophet Gad, David&#8217;s seer, saying, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>&#8220;Go and tell David, &#8216;Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>: &#8220;I offer you three <i>things;</i> choose one of them for yourself, that I may do <i>it</i> to you.&#8221; &#8217; &#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So Gad came to David and told him; and he said to him, &#8220;Shall seven<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> years of famine come to you in your land? Or shall you flee three months before your enemies, while they pursue you? Or shall there be three days&#8217; plague in your land? Now consider and see what answer I should take back to Him who sent me.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And David said to Gad, &#8220;I am in great distress. Please let us fall into the hand of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, for His mercies <i>are</i> great; but do not let me fall into the hand of man.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> sent a plague upon Israel from the morning till the appointed time. From Dan to Beersheba seventy thousand men of the people died. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And when the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>angel stretched out His hand over Jerusalem to destroy it, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> relented from the destruction, and said to the angel who was destroying the people, &#8220;It is enough; now restrain your hand.&#8221; And the angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> was by the threshing floor of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>Araunah the Jebusite.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then David spoke to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> when he saw the angel who was striking the people, and said, &#8220;Surely I have sinned, and I have done wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? Let Your hand, I pray, be against me and against my father&#8217;s house.&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
The Altar on the Threshing Floor</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Sam-24-18"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And Gad came that day to David and said to him, &#8220;Go up, erect an altar to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>So David, according to the word of Gad, went up as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> commanded. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Now Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming toward him. So Araunah went out and bowed before the king with his face to the ground.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then Araunah said, &#8220;Why has my lord the king come to his servant?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-24-21">And David said, &#8220;To buy the threshing floor from you, to build an altar to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, that the plague may be withdrawn from the people.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Now Araunah said to David, &#8220;Let my lord the king take and offer up whatever <i>seems</i> good to him. Look, <i>here are</i> oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing implements and the yokes of the oxen for wood. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>All these, O king, Araunah has given to the king.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-24-23">And Araunah said to the king, &#8220;May the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God accept you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then the king said to Araunah, &#8220;No, but I will surely buy <i>it</i> from you for a price; nor will I offer burnt offerings to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> my God with that which costs me nothing.&#8221; So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And David built there an altar to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span>, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> heeded the prayers for the land, and the plague was withdrawn from Israel.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-8694a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 24:1">2 Samuel 24:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>take a census of</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8697b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 24:4">2 Samuel 24:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>overruled</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8706c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 24:13">2 Samuel 24:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'>So with MT, Syr., Tg., Vg.; LXX <i>three</i> (cf. <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="1Chr.21.12" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=1Chr.21.12&amp;version=NKJV">1 Chr. 21:12</span>)</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8709d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 24:16">2 Samuel 24:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>Angel</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-8709e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to 2 Samuel 24:16">2 Samuel 24:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>Ornan,</i> <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="1Chr.21.15" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=1Chr.21.15&amp;version=NKJV">1 Chr. 21:15</span></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
