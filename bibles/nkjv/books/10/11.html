But David remained at Jerusalem.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then it happened one evening that David arose from his bed and walked on the roof of the king&#8217;s house. And from the roof he saw a woman bathing, and the woman <i>was</i> very beautiful to behold. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So David sent and inquired about the woman. And <i>someone</i> said, &#8220;<i>Is</i> this not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>Bathsheba, the daughter of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then David sent messengers, and took her; and she came to him, and he lay with her, for she was cleansed from her impurity; and she returned to her house. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And the woman conceived; so she sent and told David, and said, &#8220;I <i>am</i> with child.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then David sent to Joab, <i>saying,</i> &#8220;Send me Uriah the Hittite.&#8221; And Joab sent Uriah to David. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>When Uriah had come to him, David asked how Joab was doing, and how the people were doing, and how the war prospered. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And David said to Uriah, &#8220;Go down to your house and wash your feet.&#8221; So Uriah departed from the king&#8217;s house, and a gift <i>of food</i> from the king followed him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But Uriah slept at the door of the king&#8217;s house with all the servants of his lord, and did not go down to his house. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So when they told David, saying, &#8220;Uriah did not go down to his house,&#8221; David said to Uriah, &#8220;Did you not come from a journey? Why did you not go down to your house?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And Uriah said to David, &#8220;The ark and Israel and Judah are dwelling in tents, and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are encamped in the open fields. Shall I then go to my house to eat and drink, and to lie with my wife? <i>As</i> you live, and <i>as</i> your soul lives, I will not do this thing.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then David said to Uriah, &#8220;Wait here today also, and tomorrow I will let you depart.&#8221; So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the next. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Now when David called him, he ate and drank before him; and he made him drunk. And at evening he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but he did not go down to his house.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>In the morning it happened that David wrote a letter to Joab and sent <i>it</i> by the hand of Uriah. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And he wrote in the letter, saying, &#8220;Set Uriah in the forefront of the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>hottest battle, and retreat from him, that he may be struck down and die.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So it was, while Joab besieged the city, that he assigned Uriah to a place where he knew there <i>were</i> valiant men. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then the men of the city came out and fought with Joab. And <i>some</i> of the people of the servants of David fell; and Uriah the Hittite died also.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>and charged the messenger, saying, &#8220;When you have finished telling the matters of the war to the king, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>if it happens that the king&#8217;s wrath rises, and he says to you: &#8216;Why did you approach so near to the city when you fought? Did you not know that they would shoot from the wall? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Who struck Abimelech the son of <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>Jerubbesheth? Was it not a woman who cast a piece of a millstone on him from the wall, so that he died in Thebez? Why did you go near the wall?&#8217;&#8212;then you shall say, &#8216;Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So the messenger went, and came and told David all that Joab had sent by him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And the messenger said to David, &#8220;Surely the men prevailed against us and came out to us in the field; then we drove them back as far as the entrance of the gate. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>The archers shot from the wall at your servants; and <i>some</i> of the king&#8217;s servants are dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then David said to the messenger, &#8220;Thus you shall say to Joab: &#8216;Do not let this thing <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another. Strengthen your attack against the city, and overthrow it.&#8217; So encourage him.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>When the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And when her mourning was over, David sent and brought her to his house, and she became his wife and bore him a son.
