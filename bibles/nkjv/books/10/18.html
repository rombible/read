<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then David sent out one third of the people under the hand of Joab, one third under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab&#8217;s brother, and one third under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said to the people, &#8220;I also will surely go out with you myself.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But the people answered, &#8220;You shall not go out! For if we flee away, they will not care about us; nor if half of us die, will they care about us. But <i>you are</i> worth ten thousand of us now. For you are now more help to us in the city.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then the king said to them, &#8220;Whatever seems best to you I will do.&#8221; So the king stood beside the gate, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now the king had commanded Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, saying, &#8220;<i>Deal</i> gently for my sake with the young man Absalom.&#8221; And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains orders concerning Absalom.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So the people went out into the field of battle against Israel. And the battle was in the woods of Ephraim. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>The people of Israel were overthrown there before the servants of David, and a great slaughter of twenty thousand took place there that day. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For the battle there was scattered over the face of the whole countryside, and the woods devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then Absalom met the servants of David. Absalom rode on a mule. The mule went under the thick boughs of a great terebinth tree, and his head caught in the terebinth; so he was left hanging between heaven and earth. And the mule which <i>was</i> under him went on. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Now a certain man saw <i>it</i> and told Joab, and said, &#8220;I just saw Absalom hanging in a terebinth tree!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So Joab said to the man who told him, &#8220;You just saw <i>him!</i> And why did you not strike him there to the ground? I would have given you ten <i>shekels</i> of silver and a belt.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But the man said to Joab, &#8220;Though I were to receive a thousand <i>shekels</i> of silver in my hand, I would not raise my hand against the king&#8217;s son. For in our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>&#8216;Beware lest anyone <i>touch</i> the young man Absalom!&#8217; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Otherwise I would have dealt falsely against my own life. For there is nothing hidden from the king, and you yourself would have set yourself against <i>me.</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then Joab said, &#8220;I cannot linger with you.&#8221; And he took three spears in his hand and thrust them through Absalom&#8217;s heart, while he was <i>still</i> alive in the midst of the terebinth tree. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And ten young men who bore Joab&#8217;s armor surrounded Absalom, and struck and killed him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing Israel. For Joab held back the people. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And they took Absalom and cast him into a large pit in the woods, and laid a very large heap of stones over him. Then all Israel fled, everyone to his tent.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and set up a <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>pillar for himself, which <i>is</i> in the King&#8217;s Valley. For he said, &#8220;I have no son to keep my name in remembrance.&#8221; He called the pillar after his own name. And to this day it is called Absalom&#8217;s Monument.</span></p> <h3>
David Hears of Absalom&#8217;s Death</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Sam-18-19"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, &#8220;Let me run now and take the news to the king, how the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>avenged him of his enemies.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And Joab said to him, &#8220;You shall not take the news this day, for you shall take the news another day. But today you shall take no news, because the king&#8217;s son is dead.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then Joab said to the Cushite, &#8220;Go, tell the king what you have seen.&#8221; So the Cushite bowed himself to Joab and ran.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said again to Joab, &#8220;But <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>whatever happens, please let me also run after the Cushite.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-18-22">So Joab said, &#8220;Why will you run, my son, since you have no news ready?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>&#8220;But whatever happens,&#8221; <i>he said,</i> &#8220;let me run.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-18-23">So he said to him, &#8220;Run.&#8221; Then Ahimaaz ran by way of the plain, and outran the Cushite.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Now David was sitting between the two gates. And the watchman went up to the roof over the gate, to the wall, lifted his eyes and looked, and there was a man, running alone. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then the watchman cried out and told the king. And the king said, &#8220;If he <i>is</i> alone, <i>there is</i> news in his mouth.&#8221; And he came rapidly and drew near.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Then the watchman saw <i>another</i> man running, and the watchman called to the gatekeeper and said, &#8220;There is <i>another</i> man, running alone!&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-18-26">And the king said, &#8220;He also brings news.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>So the watchman said, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>&#8220;I think the running of the first is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok.&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-18-27">And the king said, &#8220;He <i>is</i> a good man, and comes with good news.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>So Ahimaaz called out and said to the king, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>&#8220;All is well!&#8221; Then he bowed down with his face to the earth before the king, and said, &#8220;Blessed <i>be</i> the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> your God, who has delivered up the men who raised their hand against my lord the king!&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>The king said, &#8220;Is the young man Absalom safe?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-18-29">Ahimaaz answered, &#8220;When Joab sent the king&#8217;s servant and <i>me</i> your servant, I saw a great tumult, but I did not know what <i>it was about.</i>&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And the king said, &#8220;Turn aside <i>and</i> stand here.&#8221; So he turned aside and stood still.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Just then the Cushite came, and the Cushite said, &#8220;There is good news, my lord the king! For the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has avenged you this day of all those who rose against you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And the king said to the Cushite, &#8220;Is the young man Absalom safe?&#8221;</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-18-32">So the Cushite answered, &#8220;May the enemies of my lord the king, and all who rise against you to do harm, be like <i>that</i> young man!&#8221;</span></p> <h3>
David&#8217;s Mourning for Absalom</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Sam-18-33"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Then the king was deeply moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept. And as he went, he said thus: &#8220;O my son Absalom&#8212;my son, my son Absalom&#8212;if only I had died in your place!
