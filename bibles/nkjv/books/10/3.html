But David grew stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker.</span></p> <h3>
Sons of David</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Sam-3-2"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Sons were born to David in Hebron: His firstborn was Amnon by Ahinoam the Jezreelitess; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>his second, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>Chileab, by Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite; the third, Absalom the son of Maacah, the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and the sixth, Ithream, by David&#8217;s wife Eglah. These were born to David in Hebron.</span></p> <h3>
Abner Joins Forces with David</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Sam-3-6"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now it was so, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner was strengthening <i>his hold</i> on the house of Saul.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And Saul had a concubine, whose name <i>was</i> Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah. So <i>Ishbosheth</i> said to Abner, &#8220;Why have you gone in to my father&#8217;s concubine?&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then Abner became very angry at the words of Ishbosheth, and said, &#8220;<i>Am</i> I a dog&#8217;s head that belongs to Judah? Today I show loyalty to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not delivered you into the hand of David; and you charge me today with a fault concerning this woman? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>May God do so to Abner, and more also, if I do not do for David as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has sworn to him&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>to transfer the kingdom from the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>house of Saul, and set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan to Beersheba.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And he could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then Abner sent messengers on his behalf to David, saying, &#8220;Whose <i>is</i> the land?&#8221; saying <i>also,</i> &#8220;Make your covenant with me, and indeed my hand <i>shall be</i> with you to bring all Israel to you.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And <i>David</i> said, &#8220;Good, I will make a covenant with you. But one thing I require of you: you shall not see my face unless you first bring Michal, Saul&#8217;s daughter, when you come to see my face.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So David sent messengers to Ishbosheth, Saul&#8217;s son, saying, &#8220;Give <i>me</i> my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to myself for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And Ishbosheth sent and took her from <i>her</i> husband, from <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Paltiel the son of Laish. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then her husband went along with her to Bahurim, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>weeping behind her. So Abner said to him, &#8220;Go, return!&#8221; And he returned.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Now Abner had communicated with the elders of Israel, saying, &#8220;In time past you were seeking for David <i>to be</i> king over you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Now then, do <i>it!</i> For the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> has spoken of David, saying, &#8216;By the hand of My servant David, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>I will save My people Israel from the hand of the Philistines and the hand of all their enemies.&#8217; &#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And Abner also spoke in the hearing of Benjamin. Then Abner also went to speak in the hearing of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel and the whole house of Benjamin.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So Abner and twenty men with him came to David at Hebron. And David made a feast for Abner and the men who <i>were</i> with him. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then Abner said to David, &#8220;I will arise and go, and gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may reign over all that your heart desires.&#8221; So David sent Abner away, and he went in peace.</span></p> <h3>
Joab Murders Abner</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Sam-3-22"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>At that moment the servants of David and Joab came from a raid and brought much <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>spoil with them. But Abner <i>was</i> not with David in Hebron, for he had sent him away, and he had gone in peace. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>When Joab and all the troops that <i>were</i> with him had come, they told Joab, saying, &#8220;Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he sent him away, and he has gone in peace.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then Joab came to the king and said, &#8220;What have you done? Look, Abner came to you; why <i>is</i> it <i>that</i> you sent him away, and he has already gone? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Surely you realize that Abner the son of Ner came to deceive you, to know your going out and your coming in, and to know all that you are doing.&#8221;</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And when Joab had gone from David&#8217;s presence, he sent messengers after Abner, who brought him back from the well of Sirah. But David did not know <i>it.</i> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Now when Abner had returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him privately, and there <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>stabbed him in the stomach, so that he died for the blood of Asahel his brother.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Afterward, when David heard <i>it,</i> he said, &#8220;My kingdom and I <i>are</i> <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>guiltless before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps divine-name">Lord</span> forever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Let it rest on the head of Joab and on all his father&#8217;s house; and let there never fail to be in the <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>house of Joab one who has a discharge or is a leper, who leans on a staff or falls by the sword, or who lacks bread.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.</span></p> <h3>
David&#8217;s Mourning for Abner</span></h3><p><span class="text 2Sam-3-31"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Then David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him, &#8220;Tear your clothes, gird yourselves with sackcloth, and mourn for Abner.&#8221; And King David followed the coffin. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>So they buried Abner in Hebron; and the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And the king sang <i>a lament</i> over Abner and said:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text 2Sam-3-33">&#8220;Should Abner die as a fool dies?</span><br />
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Your hands were not bound</span><br /><span class="text 2Sam-3-34">Nor your feet put into fetters;</span><br /><span class="text 2Sam-3-34">As a man falls before wicked men, <i>so</i> you fell.&#8221;</span></p></div><p class="first-line-none top-1"><span class="text 2Sam-3-34">Then all the people wept over him again.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>And when all the people came to persuade David to eat food while it was still day, David took an oath, saying, &#8220;God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread or anything else till the sun goes down!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Now all the people took note <i>of it,</i> and it pleased them, since whatever the king did pleased all the people. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it had not been the king&#8217;s <i>intent</i> to kill Abner the son of Ner. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>Then the king said to his servants, &#8220;Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>And I <i>am</i> weak today, though anointed king; and these men, the sons of Zeruiah, <i>are</i> too harsh for me.
