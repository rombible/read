<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>fulfill my joy by being like-minded, having the same love, <i>being</i> of one accord, of one mind. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span><i>Let</i> nothing <i>be done</i> through selfish ambition or conceit, but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than himself. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Let each of you look out not only for his own interests, but also for the interests of others.</span></p> <h3>
The Humbled and Exalted Christ</span></h3><p><span class="text Phil-2-5"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>who, being in the form of God, did not consider it <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>robbery to be equal with God, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>but <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>made Himself of no reputation, taking the form of a bondservant, <i>and</i> coming in the likeness of men. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient to <i>the point of</i> death, even the death of the cross. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Therefore God also has highly exalted Him and given Him the name which is above every name, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the earth, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>and <i>that</i> every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ <i>is</i> Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</span></p> <h3>
Light Bearers</span></h3><p><span class="text Phil-2-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>for it is God who works in you both to will and to do for <i>His</i> good pleasure.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Do all things without <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>complaining and disputing,<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>that you may become blameless and <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>harmless, children of God without fault in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>holding fast the word of life, so that I may rejoice in the day of Christ that I have not run in vain or labored in vain.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Yes, and if I am being poured out <i>as a drink offering</i> on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>For the same reason you also be glad and rejoice with me.</span></p> <h3>
Timothy Commended</span></h3><p><span class="text Phil-2-19"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly, that I also may be encouraged when I know your <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>state. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>For I have no one like-minded, who will sincerely care for your state. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>For all seek their own, not the things which are of Christ Jesus. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But you know his proven character, that as a son with <i>his</i> father he served with me in the gospel. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Therefore I hope to send him at once, as soon as I see how it goes with me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>But I trust in the Lord that I myself shall also come shortly.</span></p> <h3>
Epaphroditus Praised</span></h3><p><span class="text Phil-2-25"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Yet I considered it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker, and fellow soldier, but your messenger and the one who ministered to my need; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>since he was longing for you all, and was distressed because you had heard that he was sick. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>For indeed he was sick almost unto death; but God had mercy on him, and not only on him but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Therefore I sent him the more eagerly, that when you see him again you may rejoice, and I may be less sorrowful. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness, and hold such men in esteem; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>because for the work of Christ he came close to death, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>not regarding his life, to supply what was lacking in your service toward me.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-29393a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Philippians 2:1">Philippians 2:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>encouragement</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29398b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Philippians 2:6">Philippians 2:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>something to be held onto to be equal</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29399c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Philippians 2:7">Philippians 2:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>emptied Himself</i> of His privileges</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29406d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Philippians 2:14">Philippians 2:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>grumbling</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29406e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Philippians 2:14">Philippians 2:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>arguing</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29407f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Philippians 2:15">Philippians 2:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>innocent</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29411g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Philippians 2:19">Philippians 2:19</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>condition</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29422h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Philippians 2:30">Philippians 2:30</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>risking</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
