For me to write the same things to you <i>is</i> not tedious, but for you <i>it is</i> safe.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the mutilation! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For we are the circumcision, who worship <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>God in the Spirit, rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>though I also might have confidence in the flesh. If anyone else thinks he may have confidence in the flesh, I more so: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, <i>of</i> the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews; concerning the law, a Pharisee; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>concerning zeal, persecuting the church; concerning the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But what things were gain to me, these I have counted loss for Christ. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Yet indeed I also count all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as rubbish, that I may gain Christ </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness, which <i>is</i> from the law, but that which <i>is</i> through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>that I may know Him and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>if, by any means, I may attain<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span> to the resurrection from the dead.</span></p> <h3>
Pressing Toward the Goal</span></h3><p><span class="text Phil-3-12"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Not that I have already attained,<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span> or am already perfected; but I press on, that I may lay hold of that for which Christ Jesus has also laid hold of me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Brethren, I do not count myself to have <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>apprehended; but one thing <i>I do,</i> forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forward to those things which are ahead, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>I press toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Therefore let us, as many as are mature, have this mind; and if in anything you think otherwise, God will reveal even this to you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Nevertheless, to <i>the degree</i> that we have already <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>attained, let us walk by the same <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>rule, let us be of the same mind.</span></p> <h3>
Our Citizenship in Heaven</span></h3><p><span class="text Phil-3-17"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Brethren, join in following my example, and note those who so walk, as you have us for a pattern. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, <i>that they are</i> the enemies of the cross of Christ: </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>whose end <i>is</i> destruction, whose god <i>is their</i> belly, and <i>whose</i> glory <i>is</i> in their shame&#8212;who set their mind on earthly things. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>For our citizenship is in heaven, from which we also eagerly wait for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>who will transform our lowly body that it may be conformed to His glorious body, according to the working by which He is able even to subdue all things to Himself.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-29425a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Philippians 3:3">Philippians 3:3</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M <i>in the Spirit of God</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29433b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Philippians 3:11">Philippians 3:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>arrive at</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29434c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Philippians 3:12">Philippians 3:12</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>obtained it</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29435d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Philippians 3:13">Philippians 3:13</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>laid hold of it</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29438e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Philippians 3:16">Philippians 3:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>arrived</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29438f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Philippians 3:16">Philippians 3:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>rule</i> and the rest of v. <span class="bibleref" data-bibleref="Phil.3.16" href="https://biblehub.com/passage/?search=Phil.3.16&amp;version=NKJV">16</span>.</span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
