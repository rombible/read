<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and all the brethren who are with me,</span></p><p class="top-1"><span class="text Gal-1-2">To the churches of Galatia:</span></p> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>who gave Himself for our sins, that He might deliver us from this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>to whom <i>be</i> glory forever and ever. Amen.</span></p> <h3>
Only One Gospel</span></h3><p><span class="text Gal-1-6"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>I marvel that you are turning away so soon from Him who called you in the grace of Christ, to a different gospel, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>which is not another; but there are some who trouble you and want to pervert<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span> the gospel of Christ. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But even if we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel to you than what we have preached to you, let him be <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>accursed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>As we have said before, so now I say again, if anyone preaches any other gospel to you than what you have received, let him be accursed.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? For if I still pleased men, I would not be a bondservant of Christ.</span></p> <h3>
Call to Apostleship</span></h3><p><span class="text Gal-1-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But I make known to you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught <i>it,</i> but <i>it came</i> through the revelation of Jesus Christ.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For you have heard of my former conduct in Judaism, how I persecuted the church of God beyond measure and <i>tried to</i> destroy it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And I advanced in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries in my own nation, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother&#8217;s womb and called <i>me</i> through His grace, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>to reveal His Son in me, that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately confer with flesh and blood, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those <i>who were</i> apostles before me; but I went to Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.</span></p> <h3>
Contacts at Jerusalem</span></h3><p><span class="text Gal-1-18"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Peter, and remained with him fifteen days. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>But I saw none of the other apostles except James, the Lord&#8217;s brother. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>(Now <i>concerning</i> the things which I write to you, indeed, before God, I do not lie.)</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Afterward I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea which <i>were</i> in Christ. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>But they were hearing only, &#8220;He who formerly persecuted us now preaches the faith which he once <i>tried to</i> destroy.&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And they glorified God in me.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-29065a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Galatians 1:7">Galatians 1:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>distort</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29066b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Galatians 1:8">Galatians 1:8</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Gr. <i>anathema</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29076c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Galatians 1:18">Galatians 1:18</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>Cephas</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
