<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And I went up <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>by revelation, and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to those who were of reputation, lest by any means I might run, or had run, in vain. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Yet not even Titus who <i>was</i> with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And <i>this occurred</i> because of false brethren secretly brought in (who came in by stealth to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage), </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>to whom we did not yield submission even for an hour, that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But from those who seemed to be something&#8212;whatever they were, it makes no difference to me; God <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>shows personal favoritism to no man&#8212;for those who seemed <i>to be something</i> added nothing to me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But on the contrary, when they saw that the gospel for the uncircumcised had been committed to me, as <i>the gospel</i> for the circumcised <i>was</i> to Peter </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>(for He who worked effectively in Peter for the apostleship to the circumcised also worked effectively in me toward the Gentiles), </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and when James, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that had been given to me, they gave me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we <i>should go</i> to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><i>They desired</i> only that we should remember the poor, the very thing which I also was eager to do.</span></p> <h3>
No Return to the Law</span></h3><p><span class="text Gal-2-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now when <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>Peter had come to Antioch, I <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>withstood him to his face, because he was to be blamed; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>for before certain men came from James, he would eat with the Gentiles; but when they came, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>those who were of the circumcision. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And the rest of the Jews also played the hypocrite with him, so that even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But when I saw that they were not straightforward about the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter before <i>them</i> all, &#8220;If you, being a Jew, live in the manner of Gentiles and not as the Jews, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>why do you compel Gentiles to live as <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[h]</a></span>Jews? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>We <i>who are</i> Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>knowing that a man is not <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[i]</a></span>justified by the works of the law but by faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law; for by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>&#8220;But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, <i>is</i> Christ therefore a minister of sin? Certainly not! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/2-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>For if I build again those things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/2-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>For I through the law died to the law that I might live to God. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/2-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the <i>life</i> which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/2-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>I do not set aside the grace of God; for if righteousness <i>comes</i> through the law, then Christ died <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[j]</a></span>in vain.&#8221;</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-29084a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Galatians 2:2">Galatians 2:2</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>because of</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29088b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Galatians 2:6">Galatians 2:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>does not receive the face of a man</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29091c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Galatians 2:9">Galatians 2:9</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Peter</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29093d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Galatians 2:11">Galatians 2:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>Cephas</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29093e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Galatians 2:11">Galatians 2:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>opposed</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29094f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Galatians 2:12">Galatians 2:12</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Jewish Christians</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29096g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Galatians 2:14">Galatians 2:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>how can you</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29096h"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Galatians 2:14">Galatians 2:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Some interpreters stop the quotation here.</span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29098i"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Galatians 2:16">Galatians 2:16</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>declared righteous</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29103j"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Galatians 2:21">Galatians 2:21</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>for nothing</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
