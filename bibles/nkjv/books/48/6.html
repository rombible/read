<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Bear one another&#8217;s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For if anyone thinks himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But let each one examine his own work, and then he will have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For each one shall bear his own load.</span></p> <h3>
Be Generous and Do Good</span></h3><p><span class="text Gal-6-6"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Let him who is taught the word share in all good things with him who teaches.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For he who sows to his flesh will of the flesh reap corruption, but he who sows to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap everlasting life. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And let us not grow weary while doing good, for in due season we shall reap if we do not lose heart. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all, especially to those who are of the household of faith.</span></p> <h3>
Glory Only in the Cross</span></h3><p><span class="text Gal-6-11"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>See with what large letters I have written to you with my own hand! </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>As many as desire to make a good showing in the flesh, these <i>would</i> compel you to be circumcised, only that they may not suffer persecution for the cross of Christ. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For not even those who are circumcised keep the law, but they desire to have you circumcised that they may boast in your flesh. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But God forbid that I should boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, but a new creation.</span></p> <h3>
Blessing and a Plea</span></h3><p><span class="text Gal-6-16"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And as many as walk according to this rule, peace and mercy <i>be</i> upon them, and upon the Israel of God.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>From now on let no one trouble me, for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <i>be</i> with your spirit.
