Who has bewitched you <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span>that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>among you as crucified? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>This only I want to learn from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Are you so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are you now being made perfect by the flesh? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Have you suffered so <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>many things in vain&#8212;if indeed <i>it was</i> in vain?</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Therefore He who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you, <i>does He do it</i> by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>just as Abraham <span class="oblique">&#8220;believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Therefore know that <i>only</i> those who are of faith are sons of Abraham. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel to Abraham beforehand, <i>saying,</i> <span class="oblique">&#8220;In you all the nations shall be blessed.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So then those who <i>are</i> of faith are blessed with believing Abraham.</span></p> <h3>
The Law Brings a Curse</span></h3><p><span class="text Gal-3-10"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse; for it is written, <span class="oblique">&#8220;Cursed</span> <i>is</i> <span class="oblique">everyone who does not continue in all things which are written in the book of the law, to do them.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But that no one is <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>justified by the law in the sight of God <i>is</i> evident, for <span class="oblique">&#8220;the just shall live by faith.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Yet the law is not of faith, but <span class="oblique">&#8220;the man who does them shall live by them.&#8221;</span></span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us (for it is written, <span class="oblique">&#8220;Cursed</span> <i>is</i> <span class="oblique">everyone who hangs on a tree&#8221;</span>), </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>that the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</span></p> <h3>
The Changeless Promise</span></h3><p><span class="text Gal-3-15"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Brethren, I speak in the manner of men: Though <i>it is</i> only a man&#8217;s covenant, yet <i>if it is</i> confirmed, no one annuls or adds to it. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Now to Abraham and his Seed were the promises made. He does not say, &#8220;And to seeds,&#8221; as of many, but as of one, <span class="oblique">&#8220;And to your Seed,&#8221;</span> who is Christ. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And this I say, <i>that</i> the law, which was four hundred and thirty years later, cannot annul the covenant that was confirmed before by God <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>in Christ, that it should make the promise of no effect. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>For if the inheritance <i>is</i> of the law, <i>it is</i> no longer of promise; but God gave <i>it</i> to Abraham by promise.</span></p> <h3>
Purpose of the Law</span></h3><p><span class="text Gal-3-19"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>What purpose then <i>does</i> the law <i>serve?</i> It was added because of transgressions, till the Seed should come to whom the promise was made; <i>and it was</i> appointed through angels by the hand of a mediator. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Now a mediator does not <i>mediate</i> for one <i>only,</i> but God is one.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span><i>Is</i> the law then against the promises of God? Certainly not! For if there had been a law given which could have given life, truly righteousness would have been by the law. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But the Scripture has confined all under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>But before faith came, we were kept under guard by the law, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>kept for the faith which would afterward be revealed. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Therefore the law was our <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>tutor <i>to bring us</i> to Christ, that we might be justified by faith. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>But after faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.</span></p> <h3>
Sons and Heirs</span></h3><p><span class="text Gal-3-26"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>And if you <i>are</i> Christ&#8217;s, then you are Abraham&#8217;s seed, and heirs according to the promise.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-29104a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Galatians 3:1">Galatians 3:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>that you should not obey the truth</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29104b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Galatians 3:1">Galatians 3:1</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>among you</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29107c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Galatians 3:4">Galatians 3:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>great</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29114d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Galatians 3:11">Galatians 3:11</span> <span class='footnote-text'><i>declared righteous</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29120e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Galatians 3:17">Galatians 3:17</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>in Christ</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29126f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Galatians 3:23">Galatians 3:23</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit. <i>confined</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29127g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Galatians 3:24">Galatians 3:24</span> <span class='footnote-text'>In a household, the guardian responsible for the care and discipline of the children</span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
