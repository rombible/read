<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>but is under guardians and stewards until the time appointed by the father. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But when the fullness of the time had come, God sent forth His Son, born<span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[a]</a></span> of a woman, born under the law, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>to redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption as sons.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying out, <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[b]</a></span>&#8220;Abba, Father!&#8221; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Therefore you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son, then an heir <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[c]</a></span>of God <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[d]</a></span>through Christ.</span></p> <h3>
Fears for the Church</span></h3><p><span class="text Gal-4-8"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But then, indeed, when you did not know God, you served those which by nature are not gods. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But now after you have known God, or rather are known by God, how <i>is it that</i> you turn again to the weak and beggarly elements, to which you desire again to be in bondage? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>You observe days and months and seasons and years. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>I am afraid for you, lest I have labored for you in vain.</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Brethren, I urge you to become like me, for I <i>became</i> like you. You have not injured me at all. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>You know that because of physical infirmity I preached the gospel to you at the first. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And my trial which was in my flesh you did not despise or reject, but you received me as an <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[e]</a></span>angel of God, <i>even</i> as Christ Jesus. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span><span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[f]</a></span>What then was the blessing you <i>enjoyed?</i> For I bear you witness that, if possible, you would have plucked out your own eyes and given them to me. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Have I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth?</span></p> <p>
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>They zealously court you, <i>but</i> for no good; yes, they want to exclude you, that you may be zealous for them. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>But it is good to be zealous in a good thing always, and not only when I am present with you. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>My little children, for whom I labor in birth again until Christ is formed in you, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>I would like to be present with you now and to change my tone; for I have doubts about you.</span></p> <h3>
Two Covenants</span></h3><p><span class="text Gal-4-21"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you not hear the law? </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>For it is written that Abraham had two sons: the one by a bondwoman, the other by a freewoman. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>But he <i>who was</i> of the bondwoman was born according to the flesh, and he of the freewoman through promise, </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>which things are symbolic. For these are <span class="fn"><a href="#footnotes">[g]</a></span>the two covenants: the one from Mount Sinai which gives birth to bondage, which is Hagar&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>for this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children&#8212; </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>but the Jerusalem above is free, which is the mother of us all. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>For it is written:</span></p><div class="poetry_top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Gal-4-27"><span class="oblique">&#8220;Rejoice, O barren,</span></span><br /><span class="text Gal-4-27"><i>You</i> <span class="oblique">who do not bear!</span></span><br /><span class="text Gal-4-27"><span class="oblique">Break forth and shout,</span></span><br /><span class="text Gal-4-27"><span class="oblique">You who are not in labor!</span></span><br /><span class="text Gal-4-27"><span class="oblique">For the desolate has many more children</span></span><br /><span class="text Gal-4-27"><span class="oblique">Than she who has a husband.&#8221;</span></span></p></div> <p class="top-1">
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Now we, brethren, as Isaac <i>was,</i> are children of promise. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>But, as he who was born according to the flesh then persecuted him <i>who was born</i> according to the Spirit, even so <i>it is</i> now. </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Nevertheless what does the Scripture say? <span class="oblique">&#8220;Cast out the bondwoman and her son, for</span> <span class="oblique">the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.&#8221;</span> </span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman but of the free.</span></p> <A name="footnotes"></a><div class="footnotes"><h4>Footnotes:</h4><ol><li id="fen-NKJV-29136a"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Galatians 4:4">Galatians 4:4</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>made</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29138b"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Galatians 4:6">Galatians 4:6</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Lit., in Aram., <i>Father</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29139c"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Galatians 4:7">Galatians 4:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>through God</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29139d"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Galatians 4:7">Galatians 4:7</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU omits <i>through Christ</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29146e"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Galatians 4:14">Galatians 4:14</span> <span class='footnote-text'>Or <i>messenger</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29147f"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Galatians 4:15">Galatians 4:15</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU <i>Where</i></span></li><li id="fen-NKJV-29156g"><span class="fnref')" test="Go to Galatians 4:24">Galatians 4:24</span> <span class='footnote-text'>NU, M omit <i>the</i></span></li></ol></div> <!--end of footnotes--></span></div></div></body></html>
