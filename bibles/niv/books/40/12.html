His disciples were hungry and began to pick some heads of grain and eat them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, &#8220;Look! Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath.&#8221;</p>

 you would not have condemned the innocent.</span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and a man with a shriveled hand was there. Looking for a reason to bring charges against Jesus, they asked him, &#8220;Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>He said to them, <span class="red">&#8220;If any of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?</span>
