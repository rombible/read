<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span><span class="red">He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the banquet to tell them to come, but they refused to come.</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;Then he sent some more servants and said, &#8216;Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner: My oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;But they paid no attention and went off&#8212;one to his field, another to his business.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span><span class="red">The rest seized his servants, mistreated them and killed them.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span><span class="red">The king was enraged. He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city.</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;Then he said to his servants, &#8216;The wedding banquet is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span><span class="red">So go to the street corners and invite to the banquet anyone you find.&#8217;</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><span class="red">So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, the bad as well as the good, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span><span class="red">He asked, &#8216;How did you get in here without wedding clothes, friend?&#8217; The man was speechless.</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;Then the king told the attendants, &#8216;Tie him hand and foot, and throw him outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;For many are invited, but few are chosen.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="sectionhead">Paying the Imperial Tax to Caesar</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then the Pharisees went out and laid plans to trap him in his words. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>They sent their disciples to him along with the Herodians. &#8220;Teacher,&#8221; they said, &#8220;we know that you are a man of integrity and that you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Tell us then, what is your opinion? Is it right to pay the imperial tax

 to Caesar or not?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>But Jesus, knowing their evil intent, said, <span class="red">&#8220;You hypocrites, why are you trying to trap me?</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span><span class="red">Show me the coin used for paying the tax.&#8221;</span> They brought him a denarius,

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>When they heard this, they were amazed. So they left him and went away.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Marriage at the Resurrection</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>That same day the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>&#8220;Teacher,&#8221; they said, &#8220;Moses told us that if a man dies without having children, his brother must marry the widow and raise up offspring for him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Now there were seven brothers among us. The first one married and died, and since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>The same thing happened to the second and third brother, right on down to the seventh.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Now then, at the resurrection, whose wife will she be of the seven, since all of them were married to her?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Jesus replied, <span class="red">&#8220;You are in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span><span class="red">At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span><span class="red">But about the resurrection of the dead&#8212;have you not read what God said to you,</span>
