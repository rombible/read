 came and knelt before him and said, &#8220;Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. <span class="red">&#8220;I am willing,&#8221;</span> he said. <span class="red">&#8220;Be clean!&#8221;</span> Immediately he was cleansed of his leprosy.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>The centurion replied, &#8220;Lord, I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those following him, <span class="red">&#8220;Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith.</span>
