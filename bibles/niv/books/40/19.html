<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/19-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Some Pharisees came to him to test him. They asked, &#8220;Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason?&#8221;</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/19-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8220;Why then,&#8221; they asked, &#8220;did Moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/19-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Jesus replied, <span class="red">&#8220;Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/19-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span><span class="red">I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery.&#8221;</span></p>
