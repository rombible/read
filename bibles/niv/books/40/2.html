 from the east came to Jerusalem 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and asked, &#8220;Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? We saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>When King Herod heard this he was disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>When he had called together all the people&#8217;s chief priests and teachers of the law, he asked them where the Messiah was to be born. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8220;In Bethlehem in Judea,&#8221; they replied, &#8220;for this is what the prophet has written:</p>
<div class="stanza"><p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,</p><p class="line2">are by no means least among the rulers of Judah;</p><p class="line1">for out of you will come a ruler</p><p class="line2">who will shepherd my people Israel.&#8217;
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Micah 5:2,4">b</a></sup></span>
&#8221;</p></div>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>He sent them to Bethlehem and said, &#8220;Go and search carefully for the child. As soon as you find him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship him.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>After they had heard the king, they went on their way, and the star they had seen when it rose went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>When they saw the star, they were overjoyed. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>On coming to the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their country by another route.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">The Escape to Egypt</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>When they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. &#8220;Get up,&#8221; he said, &#8220;take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>where he stayed until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet: &#8220;Out of Egypt I called my son.&#8221;

</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious, and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, in accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then what was said through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:</p>

<p class="sectionhead">The Return to Nazareth</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>and said, &#8220;Get up, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who were trying to take the child&#8217;s life are dead.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>So he got up, took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel.
