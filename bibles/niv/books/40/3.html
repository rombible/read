<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>People went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea and the whole region of the Jordan. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptizing, he said to them: &#8220;You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?
