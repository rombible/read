 for the day and sent them into his vineyard.</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;About nine in the morning he went out and saw others standing in the marketplace doing nothing.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span><span class="red">He told them, &#8216;You also go and work in my vineyard, and I will pay you whatever is right.&#8217;</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span><span class="red">So they went.</span></p><p class="reg"><span class="red">&#8220;He went out again about noon and about three in the afternoon and did the same thing.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span><span class="red">About five in the afternoon he went out and found still others standing around. He asked them, &#8216;Why have you been standing here all day long doing nothing?&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;Because no one has hired us,&#8217; they answered.</span></p><p class="reg"><span class="red">&#8220;He said to them, &#8216;You also go and work in my vineyard.&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, &#8216;Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first.&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;The workers who were hired about five in the afternoon came and each received a denarius.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><span class="red">So when those came who were hired first, they expected to receive more. But each one of them also received a denarius.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span><span class="red">When they received it, they began to grumble against the landowner.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8216;These who were hired last worked only one hour,&#8217; they said, &#8216;and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the work and the heat of the day.&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;But he answered one of them, &#8216;I am not being unfair to you, friend. Didn&#8217;t you agree to work for a denarius?</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span><span class="red">Take your pay and go. I want to give the one who was hired last the same as I gave you.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span><span class="red">Don&#8217;t I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Or are you envious because I am generous?&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;So the last will be first, and the first will be last.&#8221;</span></p>
