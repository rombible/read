<div class="chap"><p class="sectionhead">The Transfiguration</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James and John the brother of James, and led them up a high mountain by themselves. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>There he was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Just then there appeared before them Moses and Elijah, talking with Jesus.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Peter said to Jesus, &#8220;Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will put up three shelters&#8212;one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>While he was still speaking, a bright cloud covered them, and a voice from the cloud said, &#8220;This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. Listen to him!&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>When the disciples heard this, they fell facedown to the ground, terrified. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But Jesus came and touched them. <span class="red">&#8220;Get up,&#8221;</span> he said. <span class="red">&#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid.&#8221;</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>When they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus instructed them, <span class="red">&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell anyone what you have seen, until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>The disciples asked him, &#8220;Why then do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Jesus replied, <span class="red">&#8220;To be sure, Elijah comes and will restore all things.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span><span class="red">But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but have done to him everything they wished. In the same way the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands.&#8221;</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then the disciples understood that he was talking to them about John the Baptist.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Jesus Heals a Demon-Possessed Boy</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>When they came to the crowd, a man approached Jesus and knelt before him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>&#8220;Lord, have mercy on my son,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He has seizures and is suffering greatly. He often falls into the fire or into the water. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;You unbelieving and perverse generation,&#8221;</span> Jesus replied, <span class="red">&#8220;how long shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring the boy here to me.&#8221;</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of the boy, and he was healed at that moment.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, &#8220;Why couldn&#8217;t we drive it out?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>He replied, <span class="red">&#8220;Because you have so little faith. Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, &#8216;Move from here to there,&#8217; and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.&#8221;</span>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>&#8220;Yes, he does,&#8221; he replied.</p><p class="reg">When Peter came into the house, Jesus was the first to speak. <span class="red">&#8220;What do you think, Simon?&#8221;</span> he asked. <span class="red">&#8220;From whom do the kings of the earth collect duty and taxes&#8212;from their own children or from others?&#8221;</span></p>
