<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So they bound him, led him away and handed him over to Pilate the governor.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>When Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he was seized with remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8220;I have sinned,&#8221; he said, &#8220;for I have betrayed innocent blood.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;What is that to us?&#8221; they replied. &#8220;That&#8217;s your responsibility.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>The chief priests picked up the coins and said, &#8220;It is against the law to put this into the treasury, since it is blood money.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So they decided to use the money to buy the potter&#8217;s field as a burial place for foreigners. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: &#8220;They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price set on him by the people of Israel, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and they used them to buy the potter&#8217;s field, as the Lord commanded me.&#8221;

<p class="sectionhead">Jesus Before Pilate</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Meanwhile Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, &#8220;Are you the king of the Jews?&#8221;</p><p class="reg"><span class="red">&#8220;You have said so,&#8221;</span> Jesus replied.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>When he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he gave no answer. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then Pilate asked him, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you hear the testimony they are bringing against you?&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge&#8212;to the great amazement of the governor.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Now it was the governor&#8217;s custom at the festival to release a prisoner chosen by the crowd. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>At that time they had a well-known prisoner whose name was Jesus

 Barabbas. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, &#8220;Which one do you want me to release to you: Jesus Barabbas, or Jesus who is called the Messiah?&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>For he knew it was out of self-interest that they had handed Jesus over to him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>While Pilate was sitting on the judge&#8217;s seat, his wife sent him this message: &#8220;Don&#8217;t have anything to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus executed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>&#8220;Which of the two do you want me to release to you?&#8221; asked the governor.</p><p class="reg">&#8220;Barabbas,&#8221; they answered.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>&#8220;What shall I do, then, with Jesus who is called the Messiah?&#8221; Pilate asked.</p><p class="reg">They all answered, &#8220;Crucify him!&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>&#8220;Why? What crime has he committed?&#8221; asked Pilate.</p><p class="reg">But they shouted all the louder, &#8220;Crucify him!&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. &#8220;I am innocent of this man&#8217;s blood,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is your responsibility!&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>All the people answered, &#8220;His blood is on us and on our children!&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Then he released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">The Soldiers Mock Jesus</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Then the governor&#8217;s soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole company of soldiers around him.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>They spit on him, and took the staff and struck him on the head again and again.
