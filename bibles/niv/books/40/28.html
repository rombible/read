<div class="chap"><p class="sectionhead">Jesus Has Risen</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>There was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and, going to the tomb, rolled back the stone and sat on it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>The angel said to the women, &#8220;Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then go quickly and tell his disciples: &#8216;He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.&#8217; Now I have told you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Suddenly Jesus met them. <span class="red">&#8220;Greetings,&#8221;</span> he said. They came to him, clasped his feet and worshiped him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then Jesus said to them, <span class="red">&#8220;Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="sectionhead">The Guards&#8217; Report</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>When the chief priests had met with the elders and devised a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>telling them, &#8220;You are to say, &#8216;His disciples came during the night and stole him away while we were asleep.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>If this report gets to the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. And this story has been widely circulated among the Jews to this very day.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">The Great Commission</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then Jesus came to them and said, <span class="red">&#8220;All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span><span class="red">Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span><span class="red">and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.&#8221;</span></p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
