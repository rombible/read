<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Some men brought to him a paralyzed man, lying on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the man, <span class="red">&#8220;Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>At this, some of the teachers of the law said to themselves, &#8220;This fellow is blaspheming!&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said, <span class="red">&#8220;Why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts?</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span><span class="red">Which is easier: to say, &#8216;Your sins are forgiven,&#8217; or to say, &#8216;Get up and walk&#8217;?</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span><span class="red">But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.&#8221;</span> So he said to the paralyzed man, <span class="red">&#8220;Get up, take your mat and go home.&#8221;</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then the man got up and went home. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>When the crowd saw this, they were filled with awe; and they praised God, who had given such authority to man.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">The Calling of Matthew</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector&#8217;s booth. <span class="red">&#8220;Follow me,&#8221;</span> he told him, and Matthew got up and followed him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>While Jesus was having dinner at Matthew&#8217;s house, many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with him and his disciples. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, &#8220;Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>On hearing this, Jesus said, <span class="red">&#8220;It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span><span class="red">But go and learn what this means: &#8216;I desire mercy, not sacrifice.&#8217;
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hosea 6:6">a</a></sup></span>
 For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="sectionhead">Jesus Questioned About Fasting</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then John&#8217;s disciples came and asked him, &#8220;How is it that we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Jesus answered, <span class="red">&#8220;How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while he is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast.</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch will pull away from the garment, making the tear worse.</span>

<p class="sectionhead">Jesus Raises a Dead Girl and Heals a Sick Woman</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>While he was saying this, a synagogue leader came and knelt before him and said, &#8220;My daughter has just died. But come and put your hand on her, and she will live.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Jesus got up and went with him, and so did his disciples.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Just then a woman who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>She said to herself, &#8220;If I only touch his cloak, I will be healed.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Jesus turned and saw her. <span class="red">&#8220;Take heart, daughter,&#8221;</span> he said, <span class="red">&#8220;your faith has healed you.&#8221;</span> And the woman was healed at that moment.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>When Jesus entered the synagogue leader&#8217;s house and saw the noisy crowd and people playing pipes,

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>After the crowd had been put outside, he went in and took the girl by the hand, and she got up. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>News of this spread through all that region.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>When he had gone indoors, the blind men came to him, and he asked them, <span class="red">&#8220;Do you believe that I am able to do this?&#8221;</span></p><p class="reg">&#8220;Yes, Lord,&#8221; they replied.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Then he touched their eyes and said, <span class="red">&#8220;According to your faith let it be done to you&#8221;;</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>and their sight was restored. Jesus warned them sternly, <span class="red">&#8220;See that no one knows about this.&#8221;</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>But they went out and spread the news about him all over that region.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>While they were going out, a man who was demon-possessed and could not talk was brought to Jesus. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And when the demon was driven out, the man who had been mute spoke. The crowd was amazed and said, &#8220;Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel.&#8221;</p>
