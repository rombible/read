They destroyed the high places and the altars throughout Judah and Benjamin and in Ephraim and Manasseh. After they had destroyed all of them, the Israelites returned to their own towns and to their own property.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>The king contributed from his own possessions for the morning and evening burnt offerings and for the burnt offerings on the Sabbaths, at the New Moons and at the appointed festivals as written in the Law of the <span class="name">Lord</span>. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>He ordered the people living in Jerusalem to give the portion due the priests and Levites so they could devote themselves to the Law of the <span class="name">Lord</span>. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>As soon as the order went out, the Israelites generously gave the firstfruits of their grain, new wine, olive oil and honey and all that the fields produced. They brought a great amount, a tithe of everything. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>The people of Israel and Judah who lived in the towns of Judah also brought a tithe of their herds and flocks and a tithe of the holy things dedicated to the <span class="name">Lord</span> their God, and they piled them in heaps. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>They began doing this in the third month and finished in the seventh month. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>When Hezekiah and his officials came and saw the heaps, they praised the <span class="name">Lord</span> and blessed his people Israel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Hezekiah asked the priests and Levites about the heaps; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and Azariah the chief priest, from the family of Zadok, answered, &#8220;Since the people began to bring their contributions to the temple of the <span class="name">Lord</span>, we have had enough to eat and plenty to spare, because the <span class="name">Lord</span> has blessed his people, and this great amount is left over.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Hezekiah gave orders to prepare storerooms in the temple of the <span class="name">Lord</span>, and this was done. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then they faithfully brought in the contributions, tithes and dedicated gifts. Konaniah, a Levite, was the overseer in charge of these things, and his brother Shimei was next in rank. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismakiah, Mahath and Benaiah were assistants of Konaniah and Shimei his brother.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Kore son of Imnah the Levite, keeper of the East Gate, was in charge of the freewill offerings given to God, distributing the contributions made to the <span class="name">Lord</span> and also the consecrated gifts. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah and Shekaniah assisted him faithfully in the towns of the priests, distributing to their fellow priests according to their divisions, old and young alike.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>In addition, they distributed to the males three years old or more whose names were in the genealogical records&#8212;all who would enter the temple of the <span class="name">Lord</span> to perform the daily duties of their various tasks, according to their responsibilities and their divisions. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And they distributed to the priests enrolled by their families in the genealogical records and likewise to the Levites twenty years old or more, according to their responsibilities and their divisions. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>They included all the little ones, the wives, and the sons and daughters of the whole community listed in these genealogical records. For they were faithful in consecrating themselves.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>As for the priests, the descendants of Aaron, who lived on the farm lands around their towns or in any other towns, men were designated by name to distribute portions to every male among them and to all who were recorded in the genealogies of the Levites.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>This is what Hezekiah did throughout Judah, doing what was good and right and faithful before the <span class="name">Lord</span> his God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>In everything that he undertook in the service of God&#8217;s temple and in obedience to the law and the commands, he sought his God and worked wholeheartedly.
