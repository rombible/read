 of Uriel of Gibeah.</p><p class="reg">There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Abijah went into battle with an army of four hundred thousand able fighting men, and Jeroboam drew up a battle line against him with eight hundred thousand able troops.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim, in the hill country of Ephraim, and said, &#8220;Jeroboam and all Israel, listen to me! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Don&#8217;t you know that the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, has given the kingship of Israel to David and his descendants forever by a covenant of salt? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Yet Jeroboam son of Nebat, an official of Solomon son of David, rebelled against his master. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Some worthless scoundrels gathered around him and opposed Rehoboam son of Solomon when he was young and indecisive and not strong enough to resist them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8220;And now you plan to resist the kingdom of the <span class="name">Lord</span>, which is in the hands of David&#8217;s descendants. You are indeed a vast army and have with you the golden calves that Jeroboam made to be your gods. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But didn&#8217;t you drive out the priests of the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and make priests of your own as the peoples of other lands do? Whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams may become a priest of what are not gods.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8220;As for us, the <span class="name">Lord</span> is our God, and we have not forsaken him. The priests who serve the <span class="name">Lord</span> are sons of Aaron, and the Levites assist them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Every morning and evening they present burnt offerings and fragrant incense to the <span class="name">Lord</span>. They set out the bread on the ceremonially clean table and light the lamps on the gold lampstand every evening. We are observing the requirements of the <span class="name">Lord</span> our God. But you have forsaken him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>God is with us; he is our leader. His priests with their trumpets will sound the battle cry against you. People of Israel, do not fight against the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the God of your ancestors, for you will not succeed.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Now Jeroboam had sent troops around to the rear, so that while he was in front of Judah the ambush was behind them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Judah turned and saw that they were being attacked at both front and rear. Then they cried out to the <span class="name">Lord</span>. The priests blew their trumpets 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and the men of Judah raised the battle cry. At the sound of their battle cry, God routed Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>The Israelites fled before Judah, and God delivered them into their hands. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Abijah and his troops inflicted heavy losses on them, so that there were five hundred thousand casualties among Israel&#8217;s able men. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>The Israelites were subdued on that occasion, and the people of Judah were victorious because they relied on the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the God of their ancestors.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Abijah pursued Jeroboam and took from him the towns of Bethel, Jeshanah and Ephron, with their surrounding villages. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Jeroboam did not regain power during the time of Abijah. And the <span class="name">Lord</span> struck him down and he died.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>But Abijah grew in strength. He married fourteen wives and had twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.</p>
