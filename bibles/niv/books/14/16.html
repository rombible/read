<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Asa then took the silver and gold out of the treasuries of the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s temple and of his own palace and sent it to Ben-Hadad king of Aram, who was ruling in Damascus. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8220;Let there be a treaty between me and you,&#8221; he said, &#8220;as there was between my father and your father. See, I am sending you silver and gold. Now break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel so he will withdraw from me.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Ben-Hadad agreed with King Asa and sent the commanders of his forces against the towns of Israel. They conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel Maim
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Also known as Abel Beth Maakah">a</a></sup></span>
 and all the store cities of Naphtali. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>When Baasha heard this, he stopped building Ramah and abandoned his work. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then King Asa brought all the men of Judah, and they carried away from Ramah the stones and timber Baasha had been using. With them he built up Geba and Mizpah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah and said to him: &#8220;Because you relied on the king of Aram and not on the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God, the army of the king of Aram has escaped from your hand. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Were not the Cushites
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, people from the upper Nile region">b</a></sup></span>
 and Libyans a mighty army with great numbers of chariots and horsemen
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or charioteers">c</a></sup></span>
? Yet when you relied on the <span class="name">Lord</span>, he delivered them into your hand. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For the eyes of the <span class="name">Lord</span> range throughout the earth to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him. You have done a foolish thing, and from now on you will be at war.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Asa was angry with the seer because of this; he was so enraged that he put him in prison. At the same time Asa brutally oppressed some of the people.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>The events of Asa&#8217;s reign, from beginning to end, are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then in the forty-first year of his reign Asa died and rested with his ancestors.
