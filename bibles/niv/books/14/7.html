<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>The priests could not enter the temple of the <span class="name">Lord</span> because the glory of the <span class="name">Lord</span> filled it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>When all the Israelites saw the fire coming down and the glory of the <span class="name">Lord</span> above the temple, they knelt on the pavement with their faces to the ground, and they worshiped and gave thanks to the <span class="name">Lord</span>, saying,</p><div class="stanza"><p class="line1">&#8220;He is good;</p><p class="line2">his love endures forever.&#8221;</p></div>
<p class="pcontinued"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the <span class="name">Lord</span>. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand head of cattle and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep and goats. So the king and all the people dedicated the temple of God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>The priests took their positions, as did the Levites with the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s musical instruments, which King David had made for praising the <span class="name">Lord</span> and which were used when he gave thanks, saying, &#8220;His love endures forever.&#8221; Opposite the Levites, the priests blew their trumpets, and all the Israelites were standing.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Solomon consecrated the middle part of the courtyard in front of the temple of the <span class="name">Lord</span>, and there he offered burnt offerings and the fat of the fellowship offerings, because the bronze altar he had made could not hold the burnt offerings, the grain offerings and the fat portions.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So Solomon observed the festival at that time for seven days, and all Israel with him&#8212;a vast assembly, people from Lebo Hamath to the Wadi of Egypt. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>On the eighth day they held an assembly, for they had celebrated the dedication of the altar for seven days and the festival for seven days more. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>On the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people to their homes, joyful and glad in heart for the good things the <span class="name">Lord</span> had done for David and Solomon and for his people Israel.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">The <span class="name">Lord</span> Appears to Solomon</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>When Solomon had finished the temple of the <span class="name">Lord</span> and the royal palace, and had succeeded in carrying out all he had in mind to do in the temple of the <span class="name">Lord</span> and in his own palace, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>the <span class="name">Lord</span> appeared to him at night and said:</p><p class="emb">&#8220;I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for myself as a temple for sacrifices.</p>
<p class="emb"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8220;When I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain, or command locusts to devour the land or send a plague among my people,

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Now my eyes will be open and my ears attentive to the prayers offered in this place. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>I have chosen and consecrated this temple so that my Name may be there forever. My eyes and my heart will always be there.</p>
<p class="emb"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>&#8220;As for you, if you walk before me faithfully as David your father did, and do all I command, and observe my decrees and laws, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>I will establish your royal throne, as I covenanted with David your father when I said, &#8216;You shall never fail to have a successor to rule over Israel.&#8217;</p>

 turn away and forsake the decrees and commands I have given you
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="The Hebrew is plural.">b</a></sup></span>
 and go off to serve other gods and worship them,

 who pass by will be appalled and say, &#8216;Why has the <span class="name">Lord</span> done such a thing to this land and to this temple?&#8217;
