<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>He did evil in the eyes of the <span class="name">Lord</span>, following the detestable practices of the nations the <span class="name">Lord</span> had driven out before the Israelites. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>He rebuilt the high places his father Hezekiah had demolished; he also erected altars to the Baals and made Asherah poles. He bowed down to all the starry hosts and worshiped them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>He built altars in the temple of the <span class="name">Lord</span>, of which the <span class="name">Lord</span> had said, &#8220;My Name will remain in Jerusalem forever.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>In both courts of the temple of the <span class="name">Lord</span>, he built altars to all the starry hosts. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>He sacrificed his children in the fire in the Valley of Ben Hinnom, practiced divination and witchcraft, sought omens, and consulted mediums and spiritists. He did much evil in the eyes of the <span class="name">Lord</span>, arousing his anger.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>He took the image he had made and put it in God&#8217;s temple, of which God had said to David and to his son Solomon, &#8220;In this temple and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my Name forever. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>I will not again make the feet of the Israelites leave the land I assigned to your ancestors, if only they will be careful to do everything I commanded them concerning all the laws, decrees and regulations given through Moses.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But Manasseh led Judah and the people of Jerusalem astray, so that they did more evil than the nations the <span class="name">Lord</span> had destroyed before the Israelites.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> spoke to Manasseh and his people, but they paid no attention. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So the <span class="name">Lord</span> brought against them the army commanders of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh prisoner, put a hook in his nose, bound him with bronze shackles and took him to Babylon. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>In his distress he sought the favor of the <span class="name">Lord</span> his God and humbled himself greatly before the God of his ancestors. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And when he prayed to him, the <span class="name">Lord</span> was moved by his entreaty and listened to his plea; so he brought him back to Jerusalem and to his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the <span class="name">Lord</span> is God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Afterward he rebuilt the outer wall of the City of David, west of the Gihon spring in the valley, as far as the entrance of the Fish Gate and encircling the hill of Ophel; he also made it much higher. He stationed military commanders in all the fortified cities in Judah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>He got rid of the foreign gods and removed the image from the temple of the <span class="name">Lord</span>, as well as all the altars he had built on the temple hill and in Jerusalem; and he threw them out of the city. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then he restored the altar of the <span class="name">Lord</span> and sacrificed fellowship offerings and thank offerings on it, and told Judah to serve the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>The people, however, continued to sacrifice at the high places, but only to the <span class="name">Lord</span> their God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>The other events of Manasseh&#8217;s reign, including his prayer to his God and the words the seers spoke to him in the name of the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, are written in the annals of the kings of Israel.
