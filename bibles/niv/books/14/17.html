<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> was with Jehoshaphat because he followed the ways of his father David before him. He did not consult the Baals 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>but sought the God of his father and followed his commands rather than the practices of Israel. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> established the kingdom under his control; and all Judah brought gifts to Jehoshaphat, so that he had great wealth and honor.
