<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard this (he was in Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon), he returned from Egypt. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So they sent for Jeroboam, and he and all Israel went to Rehoboam and said to him: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8220;Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but now lighten the harsh labor and the heavy yoke he put on us, and we will serve you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Rehoboam answered, &#8220;Come back to me in three days.&#8221; So the people went away.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then King Rehoboam consulted the elders who had served his father Solomon during his lifetime. &#8220;How would you advise me to answer these people?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>They replied, &#8220;If you will be kind to these people and please them and give them a favorable answer, they will always be your servants.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But Rehoboam rejected the advice the elders gave him and consulted the young men who had grown up with him and were serving him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>He asked them, &#8220;What is your advice? How should we answer these people who say to me, &#8216;Lighten the yoke your father put on us&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>The young men who had grown up with him replied, &#8220;The people have said to you, &#8216;Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but make our yoke lighter.&#8217; Now tell them, &#8216;My little finger is thicker than my father&#8217;s waist. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>My father laid on you a heavy yoke; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Three days later Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam, as the king had said, &#8220;Come back to me in three days.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>The king answered them harshly. Rejecting the advice of the elders, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>he followed the advice of the young men and said, &#8220;My father made your yoke heavy; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So the king did not listen to the people, for this turn of events was from God, to fulfill the word the <span class="name">Lord</span> had spoken to Jeroboam son of Nebat through Ahijah the Shilonite.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>When all Israel saw that the king refused to listen to them, they answered the king:</p><div class="stanza"><p class="line1">&#8220;What share do we have in David,</p><p class="line2">what part in Jesse&#8217;s son?</p><p class="line1">To your tents, Israel!</p><p class="line2">Look after your own house, David!&#8221;</p></div><p class="pcontinued">So all the Israelites went home. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But as for the Israelites who were living in the towns of Judah, Rehoboam still ruled over them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>King Rehoboam sent out Adoniram,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew Hadoram, a variant of Adoniram">a</a></sup></span>
 who was in charge of forced labor, but the Israelites stoned him to death. King Rehoboam, however, managed to get into his chariot and escape to Jerusalem.
