<p class="sectionhead">The Ark Brought to the Temple</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then Solomon summoned to Jerusalem the elders of Israel, all the heads of the tribes and the chiefs of the Israelite families, to bring up the ark of the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s covenant from Zion, the City of David. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And all the Israelites came together to the king at the time of the festival in the seventh month.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>When all the elders of Israel had arrived, the Levites took up the ark, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and they brought up the ark and the tent of meeting and all the sacred furnishings in it. The Levitical priests carried them up; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and King Solomon and the entire assembly of Israel that had gathered about him were before the ark, sacrificing so many sheep and cattle that they could not be recorded or counted.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>The priests then brought the ark of the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s covenant to its place in the inner sanctuary of the temple, the Most Holy Place, and put it beneath the wings of the cherubim. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>The cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark and covered the ark and its carrying poles. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>These poles were so long that their ends, extending from the ark, could be seen from in front of the inner sanctuary, but not from outside the Holy Place; and they are still there today. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets that Moses had placed in it at Horeb, where the <span class="name">Lord</span> made a covenant with the Israelites after they came out of Egypt.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>The priests then withdrew from the Holy Place. All the priests who were there had consecrated themselves, regardless of their divisions. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>All the Levites who were musicians&#8212;Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun and their sons and relatives&#8212;stood on the east side of the altar, dressed in fine linen and playing cymbals, harps and lyres. They were accompanied by 120 priests sounding trumpets. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>The trumpeters and musicians joined in unison to give praise and thanks to the <span class="name">Lord</span>.
