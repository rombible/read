<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>he captured the fortified cities of Judah and came as far as Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then the prophet Shemaiah came to Rehoboam and to the leaders of Judah who had assembled in Jerusalem for fear of Shishak, and he said to them, &#8220;This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> says, &#8216;You have abandoned me; therefore, I now abandon you to Shishak.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>The leaders of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, &#8220;The <span class="name">Lord</span> is just.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>When the <span class="name">Lord</span> saw that they humbled themselves, this word of the <span class="name">Lord</span> came to Shemaiah: &#8220;Since they have humbled themselves, I will not destroy them but will soon give them deliverance.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>They will, however, become subject to him, so that they may learn the difference between serving me and serving the kings of other lands.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>When Shishak king of Egypt attacked Jerusalem, he carried off the treasures of the temple of the <span class="name">Lord</span> and the treasures of the royal palace. He took everything, including the gold shields Solomon had made. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So King Rehoboam made bronze shields to replace them and assigned these to the commanders of the guard on duty at the entrance to the royal palace. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Whenever the king went to the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s temple, the guards went with him, bearing the shields, and afterward they returned them to the guardroom.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Because Rehoboam humbled himself, the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s anger turned from him, and he was not totally destroyed. Indeed, there was some good in Judah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>King Rehoboam established himself firmly in Jerusalem and continued as king. He was forty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city the <span class="name">Lord</span> had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel in which to put his Name. His mother&#8217;s name was Naamah; she was an Ammonite. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>He did evil because he had not set his heart on seeking the <span class="name">Lord</span>.</p>
