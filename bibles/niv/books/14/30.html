<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>The king and his officials and the whole assembly in Jerusalem decided to celebrate the Passover in the second month. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>They had not been able to celebrate it at the regular time because not enough priests had consecrated themselves and the people had not assembled in Jerusalem. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>The plan seemed right both to the king and to the whole assembly. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>They decided to send a proclamation throughout Israel, from Beersheba to Dan, calling the people to come to Jerusalem and celebrate the Passover to the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel. It had not been celebrated in large numbers according to what was written.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>At the king&#8217;s command, couriers went throughout Israel and Judah with letters from the king and from his officials, which read:</p><p class="emb">&#8220;People of Israel, return to the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, that he may return to you who are left, who have escaped from the hand of the kings of Assyria. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Do not be like your parents and your fellow Israelites, who were unfaithful to the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the God of their ancestors, so that he made them an object of horror, as you see. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Do not be stiff-necked, as your ancestors were; submit to the <span class="name">Lord</span>. Come to his sanctuary, which he has consecrated forever. Serve the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God, so that his fierce anger will turn away from you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>If you return to the <span class="name">Lord</span>, then your fellow Israelites and your children will be shown compassion by their captors and will return to this land, for the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God is gracious and compassionate. He will not turn his face from you if you return to him.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>The couriers went from town to town in Ephraim and Manasseh, as far as Zebulun, but people scorned and ridiculed them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Nevertheless, some from Asher, Manasseh and Zebulun humbled themselves and went to Jerusalem.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then they took up their regular positions as prescribed in the Law of Moses the man of God. The priests splashed against the altar the blood handed to them by the Levites. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Since many in the crowd had not consecrated themselves, the Levites had to kill the Passover lambs for all those who were not ceremonially clean and could not consecrate their lambs
