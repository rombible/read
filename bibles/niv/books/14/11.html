<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>But this word of the <span class="name">Lord</span> came to Shemaiah the man of God: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8220;Say to Rehoboam son of Solomon king of Judah and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8216;This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> says: Do not go up to fight against your fellow Israelites. Go home, every one of you, for this is my doing.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221; So they obeyed the words of the <span class="name">Lord</span> and turned back from marching against Jeroboam.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Rehoboam Fortifies Judah</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem and built up towns for defense in Judah: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Beth Zur, Soko, Adullam, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Gath, Mareshah, Ziph, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Zorah, Aijalon and Hebron. These were fortified cities in Judah and Benjamin. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>He strengthened their defenses and put commanders in them, with supplies of food, olive oil and wine. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>He put shields and spears in all the cities, and made them very strong. So Judah and Benjamin were his.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>The priests and Levites from all their districts throughout Israel sided with him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>The Levites even abandoned their pasturelands and property and came to Judah and Jerusalem, because Jeroboam and his sons had rejected them as priests of the <span class="name">Lord</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>when he appointed his own priests for the high places and for the goat and calf idols he had made. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Those from every tribe of Israel who set their hearts on seeking the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, followed the Levites to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices to the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the God of their ancestors. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>They strengthened the kingdom of Judah and supported Rehoboam son of Solomon three years, following the ways of David and Solomon during this time.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>She bore him sons: Jeush, Shemariah and Zaham. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then he married Maakah daughter of Absalom, who bore him Abijah, Attai, Ziza and Shelomith. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Rehoboam loved Maakah daughter of Absalom more than any of his other wives and concubines. In all, he had eighteen wives and sixty concubines, twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Rehoboam appointed Abijah son of Maakah as crown prince among his brothers, in order to make him king. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>He acted wisely, dispersing some of his sons throughout the districts of Judah and Benjamin, and to all the fortified cities. He gave them abundant provisions and took many wives for them.</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
