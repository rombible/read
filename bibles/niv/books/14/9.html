Arriving with a very great caravan&#8212;with camels carrying spices, large quantities of gold, and precious stones&#8212;she came to Solomon and talked with him about all she had on her mind. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Solomon answered all her questions; nothing was too hard for him to explain to her.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But I did not believe what they said until I came and saw with my own eyes. Indeed, not even half the greatness of your wisdom was told me; you have far exceeded the report I heard. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>How happy your people must be! How happy your officials, who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom!
