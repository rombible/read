<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then Solomon spoke to all Israel&#8212;to the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, to the judges and to all the leaders in Israel, the heads of families&#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and Solomon and the whole assembly went to the high place at Gibeon, for God&#8217;s tent of meeting was there, which Moses the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s servant had made in the wilderness. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Now David had brought up the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim to the place he had prepared for it, because he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But the bronze altar that Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made was in Gibeon in front of the tabernacle of the <span class="name">Lord</span>; so Solomon and the assembly inquired of him there. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Solomon went up to the bronze altar before the <span class="name">Lord</span> in the tent of meeting and offered a thousand burnt offerings on it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>That night God appeared to Solomon and said to him, &#8220;Ask for whatever you want me to give you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Solomon answered God, &#8220;You have shown great kindness to David my father and have made me king in his place. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Now, <span class="name">Lord</span> God, let your promise to my father David be confirmed, for you have made me king over a people who are as numerous as the dust of the earth. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Give me wisdom and knowledge, that I may lead this people, for who is able to govern this great people of yours?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>God said to Solomon, &#8220;Since this is your heart&#8217;s desire and you have not asked for wealth, possessions or honor, nor for the death of your enemies, and since you have not asked for a long life but for wisdom and knowledge to govern my people over whom I have made you king, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>therefore wisdom and knowledge will be given you. And I will also give you wealth, possessions and honor, such as no king who was before you ever had and none after you will have.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then Solomon went to Jerusalem from the high place at Gibeon, from before the tent of meeting. And he reigned over Israel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Solomon accumulated chariots and horses; he had fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horses,

 which he kept in the chariot cities and also with him in Jerusalem. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>The king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar as plentiful as sycamore-fig trees in the foothills. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Solomon&#8217;s horses were imported from Egypt and from Kue
