So Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Ahaziah was twenty-two

 years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem one year. His mother&#8217;s name was Athaliah, a granddaughter of Omri.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>He too followed the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother encouraged him to act wickedly. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>He did evil in the eyes of the <span class="name">Lord</span>, as the house of Ahab had done, for after his father&#8217;s death they became his advisers, to his undoing.

 son of Ahab king of Israel to wage war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth Gilead. The Arameans wounded Joram;

 son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to Jezreel to see Joram son of Ahab because he had been wounded.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Through Ahaziah&#8217;s visit to Joram, God brought about Ahaziah&#8217;s downfall. When Ahaziah arrived, he went out with Joram to meet Jehu son of Nimshi, whom the <span class="name">Lord</span> had anointed to destroy the house of Ahab. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>While Jehu was executing judgment on the house of Ahab, he found the officials of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah&#8217;s relatives, who had been attending Ahaziah, and he killed them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>He then went in search of Ahaziah, and his men captured him while he was hiding in Samaria. He was brought to Jehu and put to death. They buried him, for they said, &#8220;He was a son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the <span class="name">Lord</span> with all his heart.&#8221; So there was no one in the house of Ahaziah powerful enough to retain the kingdom.</p>
