<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>It was found recorded there that Mordecai had exposed Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king&#8217;s officers who guarded the doorway, who had conspired to assassinate King Xerxes.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8220;What honor and recognition has Mordecai received for this?&#8221; the king asked.</p><p class="reg">&#8220;Nothing has been done for him,&#8221; his attendants answered.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/6-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>The king said, &#8220;Who is in the court?&#8221; Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the palace to speak to the king about impaling Mordecai on the pole he had set up for him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/6-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>His attendants answered, &#8220;Haman is standing in the court.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;Bring him in,&#8221; the king ordered.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>When Haman entered, the king asked him, &#8220;What should be done for the man the king delights to honor?&#8221;</p><p class="reg">Now Haman thought to himself, &#8220;Who is there that the king would rather honor than me?&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So he answered the king, &#8220;For the man the king delights to honor, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>have them bring a royal robe the king has worn and a horse the king has ridden, one with a royal crest placed on its head. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then let the robe and horse be entrusted to one of the king&#8217;s most noble princes. Let them robe the man the king delights to honor, and lead him on the horse through the city streets, proclaiming before him, &#8216;This is what is done for the man the king delights to honor!&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/6-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8220;Go at once,&#8221; the king commanded Haman. &#8220;Get the robe and the horse and do just as you have suggested for Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the king&#8217;s gate. Do not neglect anything you have recommended.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/6-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So Haman got the robe and the horse. He robed Mordecai, and led him on horseback through the city streets, proclaiming before him, &#8220;This is what is done for the man the king delights to honor!&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/6-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Afterward Mordecai returned to the king&#8217;s gate. But Haman rushed home, with his head covered in grief, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/6-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>and told Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had happened to him.</p><p class="reg">His advisers and his wife Zeresh said to him, &#8220;Since Mordecai, before whom your downfall has started, is of Jewish origin, you cannot stand against him&#8212;you will surely come to ruin!&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/6-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>While they were still talking with him, the king&#8217;s eunuchs arrived and hurried Haman away to the banquet Esther had prepared.</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
