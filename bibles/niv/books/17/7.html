It will be given you. What is your request? Even up to half the kingdom, it will be granted.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/7-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then Queen Esther answered, &#8220;If I have found favor with you, Your Majesty, and if it pleases you, grant me my life&#8212;this is my petition. And spare my people&#8212;this is my request. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For I and my people have been sold to be destroyed, killed and annihilated. If we had merely been sold as male and female slaves, I would have kept quiet, because no such distress would justify disturbing the king.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/7-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>The king got up in a rage, left his wine and went out into the palace garden. But Haman, realizing that the king had already decided his fate, stayed behind to beg Queen Esther for his life.</p>
