<p class="sectionhead">Hosea&#8217;s Wife and Children</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>When the <span class="name">Lord</span> began to speak through Hosea, the <span class="name">Lord</span> said to him, &#8220;Go, marry a promiscuous woman and have children with her, for like an adulterous wife this land is guilty of unfaithfulness to the <span class="name">Lord</span>.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So he married Gomer daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then the <span class="name">Lord</span> said to Hosea, &#8220;Call him Jezreel, because I will soon punish the house of Jehu for the massacre at Jezreel, and I will put an end to the kingdom of Israel. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>In that day I will break Israel&#8217;s bow in the Valley of Jezreel.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Gomer conceived again and gave birth to a daughter. Then the <span class="name">Lord</span> said to Hosea, &#8220;Call her Lo-Ruhamah (which means &#8220;not loved&#8221;), for I will no longer show love to Israel, that I should at all forgive them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Yet I will show love to Judah; and I will save them&#8212;not by bow, sword or battle, or by horses and horsemen, but I, the <span class="name">Lord</span> their God, will save them.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>After she had weaned Lo-Ruhamah, Gomer had another son. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then the <span class="name">Lord</span> said, &#8220;Call him Lo-Ammi (which means &#8220;not my people&#8221;), for you are not my people, and I am not your God.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>The people of Judah and the people of Israel will come together; they will appoint one leader and will come up out of the land, for great will be the day of Jezreel.
