In those days the word of the <span class="name">Lord</span> was rare; there were not many visions.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>One night Eli, whose eyes were becoming so weak that he could barely see, was lying down in his usual place. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the house of the <span class="name">Lord</span>, where the ark of God was. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then the <span class="name">Lord</span> called Samuel.</p><p class="reg">Samuel answered, &#8220;Here I am.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And he ran to Eli and said, &#8220;Here I am; you called me.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">But Eli said, &#8220;I did not call; go back and lie down.&#8221; So he went and lay down.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Again the <span class="name">Lord</span> called, &#8220;Samuel!&#8221; And Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, &#8220;Here I am; you called me.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;My son,&#8221; Eli said, &#8220;I did not call; go back and lie down.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now Samuel did not yet know the <span class="name">Lord</span>: The word of the <span class="name">Lord</span> had not yet been revealed to him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>A third time the <span class="name">Lord</span> called, &#8220;Samuel!&#8221; And Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, &#8220;Here I am; you called me.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">Then Eli realized that the <span class="name">Lord</span> was calling the boy. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So Eli told Samuel, &#8220;Go and lie down, and if he calls you, say, &#8216;Speak, <span class="name">Lord</span>, for your servant is listening.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221; So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> came and stood there, calling as at the other times, &#8220;Samuel! Samuel!&#8221;</p><p class="reg">Then Samuel said, &#8220;Speak, for your servant is listening.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And the <span class="name">Lord</span> said to Samuel: &#8220;See, I am about to do something in Israel that will make the ears of everyone who hears about it tingle. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>At that time I will carry out against Eli everything I spoke against his family&#8212;from beginning to end. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For I told him that I would judge his family forever because of the sin he knew about; his sons blasphemed God,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="An ancient Hebrew scribal tradition (see also Septuagint); Masoretic Text sons made themselves contemptible">a</a></sup></span>
 and he failed to restrain them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Therefore I swore to the house of Eli, &#8216;The guilt of Eli&#8217;s house will never be atoned for by sacrifice or offering.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Samuel lay down until morning and then opened the doors of the house of the <span class="name">Lord</span>. He was afraid to tell Eli the vision, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>but Eli called him and said, &#8220;Samuel, my son.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">Samuel answered, &#8220;Here I am.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>&#8220;What was it he said to you?&#8221; Eli asked. &#8220;Do not hide it from me. May God deal with you, be it ever so severely, if you hide from me anything he told you.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>So Samuel told him everything, hiding nothing from him. Then Eli said, &#8220;He is the <span class="name">Lord</span>; let him do what is good in his eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> was with Samuel as he grew up, and he let none of Samuel&#8217;s words fall to the ground.
