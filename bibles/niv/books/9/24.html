<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So Saul took three thousand able young men from all Israel and set out to look for David and his men near the Crags of the Wild Goats.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>He came to the sheep pens along the way; a cave was there, and Saul went in to relieve himself. David and his men were far back in the cave. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>The men said, &#8220;This is the day the <span class="name">Lord</span> spoke of when he said
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or ''Today the LORD is saying">a</a></sup></span>
 to you, &#8216;I will give your enemy into your hands for you to deal with as you wish.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221; Then David crept up unnoticed and cut off a corner of Saul&#8217;s robe.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Afterward, David was conscience-stricken for having cut off a corner of his robe. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>He said to his men, &#8220;The <span class="name">Lord</span> forbid that I should do such a thing to my master, the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s anointed, or lay my hand on him; for he is the anointed of the <span class="name">Lord</span>.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>With these words David sharply rebuked his men and did not allow them to attack Saul. And Saul left the cave and went his way.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then David went out of the cave and called out to Saul, &#8220;My lord the king!&#8221; When Saul looked behind him, David bowed down and prostrated himself with his face to the ground. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>He said to Saul, &#8220;Why do you listen when men say, &#8216;David is bent on harming you&#8217;? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>This day you have seen with your own eyes how the <span class="name">Lord</span> delivered you into my hands in the cave. Some urged me to kill you, but I spared you; I said, &#8216;I will not lay my hand on my lord, because he is the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s anointed.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>See, my father, look at this piece of your robe in my hand! I cut off the corner of your robe but did not kill you. See that there is nothing in my hand to indicate that I am guilty of wrongdoing or rebellion. I have not wronged you, but you are hunting me down to take my life. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>May the <span class="name">Lord</span> judge between you and me. And may the <span class="name">Lord</span> avenge the wrongs you have done to me, but my hand will not touch you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>As the old saying goes, &#8216;From evildoers come evil deeds,&#8217; so my hand will not touch you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>&#8220;Against whom has the king of Israel come out? Who are you pursuing? A dead dog? A flea? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>May the <span class="name">Lord</span> be our judge and decide between us. May he consider my cause and uphold it; may he vindicate me by delivering me from your hand.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>When David finished saying this, Saul asked, &#8220;Is that your voice, David my son?&#8221; And he wept aloud. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>&#8220;You are more righteous than I,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You have treated me well, but I have treated you badly. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>You have just now told me about the good you did to me; the <span class="name">Lord</span> delivered me into your hands, but you did not kill me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>When a man finds his enemy, does he let him get away unharmed? May the <span class="name">Lord</span> reward you well for the way you treated me today. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>I know that you will surely be king and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hands. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Now swear to me by the <span class="name">Lord</span> that you will not kill off my descendants or wipe out my name from my father&#8217;s family.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So David gave his oath to Saul. Then Saul returned home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold.</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><A name="footnotes"></a><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotebot">Or <i>&#8220;Today the <span class="name">Lord</span> is saying</i></span><br><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
