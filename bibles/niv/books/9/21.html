<div class="chap"><p class="sectionhead">David at Nob</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>David went to Nob, to Ahimelek the priest. Ahimelek trembled when he met him, and asked, &#8220;Why are you alone? Why is no one with you?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>David answered Ahimelek the priest, &#8220;The king sent me on a mission and said to me, &#8216;No one is to know anything about the mission I am sending you on.&#8217; As for my men, I have told them to meet me at a certain place. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Now then, what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever you can find.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But the priest answered David, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have any ordinary bread on hand; however, there is some consecrated bread here&#8212;provided the men have kept themselves from women.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>David replied, &#8220;Indeed women have been kept from us, as usual whenever
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or from us in the past few days since">a</a></sup></span>
 I set out. The men&#8217;s bodies are holy even on missions that are not holy. How much more so today!&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So the priest gave him the consecrated bread, since there was no bread there except the bread of the Presence that had been removed from before the <span class="name">Lord</span> and replaced by hot bread on the day it was taken away.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now one of Saul&#8217;s servants was there that day, detained before the <span class="name">Lord</span>; he was Doeg the Edomite, Saul&#8217;s chief shepherd.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>David asked Ahimelek, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you have a spear or a sword here? I haven&#8217;t brought my sword or any other weapon, because the king&#8217;s mission was urgent.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>The priest replied, &#8220;The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the Valley of Elah, is here; it is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you want it, take it; there is no sword here but that one.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">David said, &#8220;There is none like it; give it to me.&#8221;</p>
<p class="sectionhead">David at Gath</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>That day David fled from Saul and went to Achish king of Gath. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But the servants of Achish said to him, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t this David, the king of the land? Isn&#8217;t he the one they sing about in their dances:</p><div class="stanza"><p class="line1">&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;Saul has slain his thousands,</p><p class="line2">and David his tens of thousands&#8217;?&#8221;</p></div>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>David took these words to heart and was very much afraid of Achish king of Gath. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So he pretended to be insane in their presence; and while he was in their hands he acted like a madman, making marks on the doors of the gate and letting saliva run down his beard.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Achish said to his servants, &#8220;Look at the man! He is insane! Why bring him to me? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Am I so short of madmen that you have to bring this fellow here to carry on like this in front of me?
