<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>When you leave me today, you will meet two men near Rachel&#8217;s tomb, at Zelzah on the border of Benjamin. They will say to you, &#8216;The donkeys you set out to look for have been found. And now your father has stopped thinking about them and is worried about you. He is asking, &#8220;What shall I do about my son?&#8221;&#8239;&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8220;Then you will go on from there until you reach the great tree of Tabor. Three men going up to worship God at Bethel will meet you there. One will be carrying three young goats, another three loaves of bread, and another a skin of wine. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>They will greet you and offer you two loaves of bread, which you will accept from them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8220;After that you will go to Gibeah of God, where there is a Philistine outpost. As you approach the town, you will meet a procession of prophets coming down from the high place with lyres, timbrels, pipes and harps being played before them, and they will be prophesying. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>The Spirit of the <span class="name">Lord</span> will come powerfully upon you, and you will prophesy with them; and you will be changed into a different person. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Once these signs are fulfilled, do whatever your hand finds to do, for God is with you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8220;Go down ahead of me to Gilgal. I will surely come down to you to sacrifice burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, but you must wait seven days until I come to you and tell you what you are to do.&#8221;</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Saul Made King</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>As Saul turned to leave Samuel, God changed Saul&#8217;s heart, and all these signs were fulfilled that day. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>When he and his servant arrived at Gibeah, a procession of prophets met him; the Spirit of God came powerfully upon him, and he joined in their prophesying. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>When all those who had formerly known him saw him prophesying with the prophets, they asked each other, &#8220;What is this that has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>A man who lived there answered, &#8220;And who is their father?&#8221; So it became a saying: &#8220;Is Saul also among the prophets?&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>After Saul stopped prophesying, he went to the high place.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Now Saul&#8217;s uncle asked him and his servant, &#8220;Where have you been?&#8221;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;Looking for the donkeys,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But when we saw they were not to be found, we went to Samuel.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Saul&#8217;s uncle said, &#8220;Tell me what Samuel said to you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Saul replied, &#8220;He assured us that the donkeys had been found.&#8221; But he did not tell his uncle what Samuel had said about the kingship.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Samuel summoned the people of Israel to the <span class="name">Lord</span> at Mizpah 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>and said to them, &#8220;This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, says: &#8216;I brought Israel up out of Egypt, and I delivered you from the power of Egypt and all the kingdoms that oppressed you.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>But you have now rejected your God, who saves you out of all your disasters and calamities. And you have said, &#8216;No, appoint a king over us.&#8217; So now present yourselves before the <span class="name">Lord</span> by your tribes and clans.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>When Samuel had all Israel come forward by tribes, the tribe of Benjamin was taken by lot. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then he brought forward the tribe of Benjamin, clan by clan, and Matri&#8217;s clan was taken. Finally Saul son of Kish was taken. But when they looked for him, he was not to be found. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So they inquired further of the <span class="name">Lord</span>, &#8220;Has the man come here yet?&#8221;</p><p class="reg">And the <span class="name">Lord</span> said, &#8220;Yes, he has hidden himself among the supplies.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>They ran and brought him out, and as he stood among the people he was a head taller than any of the others. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Samuel said to all the people, &#8220;Do you see the man the <span class="name">Lord</span> has chosen?

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Samuel explained to the people the rights and duties of kingship.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Saul also went to his home in Gibeah, accompanied by valiant men whose hearts God had touched.
