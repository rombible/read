<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Now you have a king as your leader. As for me, I am old and gray, and my sons are here with you. I have been your leader from my youth until this day. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Here I stand. Testify against me in the presence of the <span class="name">Lord</span> and his anointed. Whose ox have I taken? Whose donkey have I taken? Whom have I cheated? Whom have I oppressed? From whose hand have I accepted a bribe to make me shut my eyes? If I have done any of these things, I will make it right.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8220;You have not cheated or oppressed us,&#8221; they replied. &#8220;You have not taken anything from anyone&#8217;s hand.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Samuel said to them, &#8220;The <span class="name">Lord</span> is witness against you, and also his anointed is witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;He is witness,&#8221; they said.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then Samuel said to the people, &#8220;It is the <span class="name">Lord</span> who appointed Moses and Aaron and brought your ancestors up out of Egypt. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now then, stand here, because I am going to confront you with evidence before the <span class="name">Lord</span> as to all the righteous acts performed by the <span class="name">Lord</span> for you and your ancestors.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8220;After Jacob entered Egypt, they cried to the <span class="name">Lord</span> for help, and the <span class="name">Lord</span> sent Moses and Aaron, who brought your ancestors out of Egypt and settled them in this place.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;But they forgot the <span class="name">Lord</span> their God; so he sold them into the hand of Sisera, the commander of the army of Hazor, and into the hands of the Philistines and the king of Moab, who fought against them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>They cried out to the <span class="name">Lord</span> and said, &#8216;We have sinned; we have forsaken the <span class="name">Lord</span> and served the Baals and the Ashtoreths. But now deliver us from the hands of our enemies, and we will serve you.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then the <span class="name">Lord</span> sent Jerub-Baal,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Also called Gideon">a</a></sup></span>
 Barak,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some Septuagint manuscripts and Syriac; Hebrew Bedan">b</a></sup></span>
 Jephthah and Samuel,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew; some Septuagint manuscripts and Syriac Samson">c</a></sup></span>
 and he delivered you from the hands of your enemies all around you, so that you lived in safety.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>&#8220;But when you saw that Nahash king of the Ammonites was moving against you, you said to me, &#8216;No, we want a king to rule over us&#8217;&#8212;even though the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God was your king. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Now here is the king you have chosen, the one you asked for; see, the <span class="name">Lord</span> has set a king over you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>If you fear the <span class="name">Lord</span> and serve and obey him and do not rebel against his commands, and if both you and the king who reigns over you follow the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God&#8212;good! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But if you do not obey the <span class="name">Lord</span>, and if you rebel against his commands, his hand will be against you, as it was against your ancestors.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>&#8220;Now then, stand still and see this great thing the <span class="name">Lord</span> is about to do before your eyes! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Is it not wheat harvest now? I will call on the <span class="name">Lord</span> to send thunder and rain. And you will realize what an evil thing you did in the eyes of the <span class="name">Lord</span> when you asked for a king.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then Samuel called on the <span class="name">Lord</span>, and that same day the <span class="name">Lord</span> sent thunder and rain. So all the people stood in awe of the <span class="name">Lord</span> and of Samuel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>The people all said to Samuel, &#8220;Pray to the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God for your servants so that we will not die, for we have added to all our other sins the evil of asking for a king.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>&#8220;Do not be afraid,&#8221; Samuel replied. &#8220;You have done all this evil; yet do not turn away from the <span class="name">Lord</span>, but serve the <span class="name">Lord</span> with all your heart. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Do not turn away after useless idols. They can do you no good, nor can they rescue you, because they are useless. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>For the sake of his great name the <span class="name">Lord</span> will not reject his people, because the <span class="name">Lord</span> was pleased to make you his own. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>As for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the <span class="name">Lord</span> by failing to pray for you. And I will teach you the way that is good and right. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>But be sure to fear the <span class="name">Lord</span> and serve him faithfully with all your heart; consider what great things he has done for you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Yet if you persist in doing evil, both you and your king will perish.&#8221;</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><A name="footnotes"></a><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotebot">Also called <i>Gideon</i></span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotebot">Some Septuagint manuscripts and Syriac; Hebrew <i>Bedan</i></span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">c</span> <span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotebot">Hebrew; some Septuagint manuscripts and Syriac <i>Samson</i></span><br><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
