<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>A certain man in Maon, who had property there at Carmel, was very wealthy. He had a thousand goats and three thousand sheep, which he was shearing in Carmel. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>His name was Nabal and his wife&#8217;s name was Abigail. She was an intelligent and beautiful woman, but her husband was surly and mean in his dealings&#8212;he was a Calebite.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>While David was in the wilderness, he heard that Nabal was shearing sheep. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So he sent ten young men and said to them, &#8220;Go up to Nabal at Carmel and greet him in my name. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Say to him: &#8216;Long life to you! Good health to you and your household! And good health to all that is yours!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;Now I hear that it is sheep-shearing time. When your shepherds were with us, we did not mistreat them, and the whole time they were at Carmel nothing of theirs was missing. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Ask your own servants and they will tell you. Therefore be favorable toward my men, since we come at a festive time. Please give your servants and your son David whatever you can find for them.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>When David&#8217;s men arrived, they gave Nabal this message in David&#8217;s name. Then they waited.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Nabal answered David&#8217;s servants, &#8220;Who is this David? Who is this son of Jesse? Many servants are breaking away from their masters these days. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Why should I take my bread and water, and the meat I have slaughtered for my shearers, and give it to men coming from who knows where?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>David&#8217;s men turned around and went back. When they arrived, they reported every word. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>David said to his men, &#8220;Each of you strap on your sword!&#8221; So they did, and David strapped his on as well. About four hundred men went up with David, while two hundred stayed with the supplies.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>One of the servants told Abigail, Nabal&#8217;s wife, &#8220;David sent messengers from the wilderness to give our master his greetings, but he hurled insults at them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Yet these men were very good to us. They did not mistreat us, and the whole time we were out in the fields near them nothing was missing. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Night and day they were a wall around us the whole time we were herding our sheep near them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Now think it over and see what you can do, because disaster is hanging over our master and his whole household. He is such a wicked man that no one can talk to him.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Abigail acted quickly. She took two hundred loaves of bread, two skins of wine, five dressed sheep, five seahs
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, probably about 60 pounds or about 27 kilograms">b</a></sup></span>
 of roasted grain, a hundred cakes of raisins and two hundred cakes of pressed figs, and loaded them on donkeys. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then she told her servants, &#8220;Go on ahead; I&#8217;ll follow you.&#8221; But she did not tell her husband Nabal.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>As she came riding her donkey into a mountain ravine, there were David and his men descending toward her, and she met them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>David had just said, &#8220;It&#8217;s been useless&#8212;all my watching over this fellow&#8217;s property in the wilderness so that nothing of his was missing. He has paid me back evil for good. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>May God deal with David,

 be it ever so severely, if by morning I leave alive one male of all who belong to him!&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>When Abigail saw David, she quickly got off her donkey and bowed down before David with her face to the ground. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>She fell at his feet and said: &#8220;Pardon your servant, my lord, and let me speak to you; hear what your servant has to say. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Please pay no attention, my lord, to that wicked man Nabal. He is just like his name&#8212;his name means Fool, and folly goes with him. And as for me, your servant, I did not see the men my lord sent. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And now, my lord, as surely as the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God lives and as you live, since the <span class="name">Lord</span> has kept you from bloodshed and from avenging yourself with your own hands, may your enemies and all who are intent on harming my lord be like Nabal. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And let this gift, which your servant has brought to my lord, be given to the men who follow you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>&#8220;Please forgive your servant&#8217;s presumption. The <span class="name">Lord</span> your God will certainly make a lasting dynasty for my lord, because you fight the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s battles, and no wrongdoing will be found in you as long as you live. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Even though someone is pursuing you to take your life, the life of my lord will be bound securely in the bundle of the living by the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God, but the lives of your enemies he will hurl away as from the pocket of a sling. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>When the <span class="name">Lord</span> has fulfilled for my lord every good thing he promised concerning him and has appointed him ruler over Israel, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>my lord will not have on his conscience the staggering burden of needless bloodshed or of having avenged himself. And when the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God has brought my lord success, remember your servant.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>David said to Abigail, &#8220;Praise be to the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, who has sent you today to meet me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>May you be blessed for your good judgment and for keeping me from bloodshed this day and from avenging myself with my own hands. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Otherwise, as surely as the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, lives, who has kept me from harming you, if you had not come quickly to meet me, not one male belonging to Nabal would have been left alive by daybreak.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Then David accepted from her hand what she had brought him and said, &#8220;Go home in peace. I have heard your words and granted your request.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>When Abigail went to Nabal, he was in the house holding a banquet like that of a king. He was in high spirits and very drunk. So she told him nothing at all until daybreak. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>Then in the morning, when Nabal was sober, his wife told him all these things, and his heart failed him and he became like a stone.
