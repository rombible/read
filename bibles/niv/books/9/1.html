<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="See Septuagint and 1 Chron. 6:26-27,33-35; or from Ramathaim Zuphim.">a</a></sup></span>
 from the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Elkanah son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>He had two wives; one was called Hannah and the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Year after year this man went up from his town to worship and sacrifice to the <span class="name">Lord</span> Almighty at Shiloh, where Hophni and Phinehas, the two sons of Eli, were priests of the <span class="name">Lord</span>. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Whenever the day came for Elkanah to sacrifice, he would give portions of the meat to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But to Hannah he gave a double portion because he loved her, and the <span class="name">Lord</span> had closed her womb. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Because the <span class="name">Lord</span> had closed Hannah&#8217;s womb, her rival kept provoking her in order to irritate her. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>This went on year after year. Whenever Hannah went up to the house of the <span class="name">Lord</span>, her rival provoked her till she wept and would not eat. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Her husband Elkanah would say to her, &#8220;Hannah, why are you weeping? Why don&#8217;t you eat? Why are you downhearted? Don&#8217;t I mean more to you than ten sons?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Once when they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh, Hannah stood up. Now Eli the priest was sitting on his chair by the doorpost of the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s house. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>In her deep anguish Hannah prayed to the <span class="name">Lord</span>, weeping bitterly. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And she made a vow, saying, &#8220;<span class="name">Lord</span> Almighty, if you will only look on your servant&#8217;s misery and remember me, and not forget your servant but give her a son, then I will give him to the <span class="name">Lord</span> for all the days of his life, and no razor will ever be used on his head.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>As she kept on praying to the <span class="name">Lord</span>, Eli observed her mouth. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Hannah was praying in her heart, and her lips were moving but her voice was not heard. Eli thought she was drunk 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>and said to her, &#8220;How long are you going to stay drunk? Put away your wine.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>&#8220;Not so, my lord,&#8221; Hannah replied, &#8220;I am a woman who is deeply troubled. I have not been drinking wine or beer; I was pouring out my soul to the <span class="name">Lord</span>. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Do not take your servant for a wicked woman; I have been praying here out of my great anguish and grief.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Eli answered, &#8220;Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant you what you have asked of him.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>She said, &#8220;May your servant find favor in your eyes.&#8221; Then she went her way and ate something, and her face was no longer downcast.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Early the next morning they arose and worshiped before the <span class="name">Lord</span> and then went back to their home at Ramah. Elkanah made love to his wife Hannah, and the <span class="name">Lord</span> remembered her. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So in the course of time Hannah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel,
