<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> Almighty says: &#8216;I will punish the Amalekites for what they did to Israel when they waylaid them as they came up from Egypt. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Now go, attack the Amalekites and totally destroy
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="The Hebrew term refers to the irrevocable giving over of things or persons to the LORD, often by totally destroying them; also in verses 8, 9, 15, 18, 20 and 21.">a</a></sup></span>
 all that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So Saul summoned the men and mustered them at Telaim&#8212;two hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand from Judah. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Saul went to the city of Amalek and set an ambush in the ravine. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then he said to the Kenites, &#8220;Go away, leave the Amalekites so that I do not destroy you along with them; for you showed kindness to all the Israelites when they came up out of Egypt.&#8221; So the Kenites moved away from the Amalekites.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then Saul attacked the Amalekites all the way from Havilah to Shur, near the eastern border of Egypt.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But Saul and the army spared Agag and the best of the sheep and cattle, the fat calves

 and lambs&#8212;everything that was good. These they were unwilling to destroy completely, but everything that was despised and weak they totally destroyed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then the word of the <span class="name">Lord</span> came to Samuel: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8220;I regret that I have made Saul king, because he has turned away from me and has not carried out my instructions.&#8221; Samuel was angry, and he cried out to the <span class="name">Lord</span> all that night.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Early in the morning Samuel got up and went to meet Saul, but he was told, &#8220;Saul has gone to Carmel.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>When Samuel reached him, Saul said, &#8220;The <span class="name">Lord</span> bless you! I have carried out the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s instructions.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But Samuel said, &#8220;What then is this bleating of sheep in my ears? What is this lowing of cattle that I hear?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Saul answered, &#8220;The soldiers brought them from the Amalekites; they spared the best of the sheep and cattle to sacrifice to the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God, but we totally destroyed the rest.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>&#8220;Enough!&#8221; Samuel said to Saul. &#8220;Let me tell you what the <span class="name">Lord</span> said to me last night.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;Tell me,&#8221; Saul replied.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Samuel said, &#8220;Although you were once small in your own eyes, did you not become the head of the tribes of Israel? The <span class="name">Lord</span> anointed you king over Israel. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And he sent you on a mission, saying, &#8216;Go and completely destroy those wicked people, the Amalekites; wage war against them until you have wiped them out.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Why did you not obey the <span class="name">Lord</span>? Why did you pounce on the plunder and do evil in the eyes of the <span class="name">Lord</span>?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>&#8220;But I did obey the <span class="name">Lord</span>,&#8221; Saul said. &#8220;I went on the mission the <span class="name">Lord</span> assigned me. I completely destroyed the Amalekites and brought back Agag their king. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>The soldiers took sheep and cattle from the plunder, the best of what was devoted to God, in order to sacrifice them to the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God at Gilgal.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But Samuel replied:</p><div class="stanza"><p class="line1">&#8220;Does the <span class="name">Lord</span> delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices</p><p class="line2">as much as in obeying the <span class="name">Lord</span>?</p><p class="line1">To obey is better than sacrifice,</p><p class="line2">and to heed is better than the fat of rams.</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>For rebellion is like the sin of divination,</p><p class="line2">and arrogance like the evil of idolatry.</p><p class="line1">Because you have rejected the word of the <span class="name">Lord</span>,</p><p class="line2">he has rejected you as king.&#8221;</p></div>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then Saul said to Samuel, &#8220;I have sinned. I violated the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s command and your instructions. I was afraid of the men and so I gave in to them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Now I beg you, forgive my sin and come back with me, so that I may worship the <span class="name">Lord</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>But Samuel said to him, &#8220;I will not go back with you.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>As Samuel turned to leave, Saul caught hold of the hem of his robe, and it tore.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>He who is the Glory of Israel does not lie or change his mind; for he is not a human being, that he should change his mind.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Saul replied, &#8220;I have sinned.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>So Samuel went back with Saul, and Saul worshiped the <span class="name">Lord</span>.</p>
