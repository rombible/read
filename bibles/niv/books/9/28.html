Achish said to David, &#8220;You must understand that you and your men will accompany me in the army.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>David said, &#8220;Then you will see for yourself what your servant can do.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">Achish replied, &#8220;Very well, I will make you my bodyguard for life.&#8221;</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Saul and the Medium at Endor</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in his own town of Ramah. Saul had expelled the mediums and spiritists from the land.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>The Philistines assembled and came and set up camp at Shunem, while Saul gathered all Israel and set up camp at Gilboa. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>When Saul saw the Philistine army, he was afraid; terror filled his heart. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>He inquired of the <span class="name">Lord</span>, but the <span class="name">Lord</span> did not answer him by dreams or Urim or prophets. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Saul then said to his attendants, &#8220;Find me a woman who is a medium, so I may go and inquire of her.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;There is one in Endor,&#8221; they said.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So Saul disguised himself, putting on other clothes, and at night he and two men went to the woman. &#8220;Consult a spirit for me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and bring up for me the one I name.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But the woman said to him, &#8220;Surely you know what Saul has done. He has cut off the mediums and spiritists from the land. Why have you set a trap for my life to bring about my death?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Saul swore to her by the <span class="name">Lord</span>, &#8220;As surely as the <span class="name">Lord</span> lives, you will not be punished for this.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then the woman asked, &#8220;Whom shall I bring up for you?&#8221;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;Bring up Samuel,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out at the top of her voice and said to Saul, &#8220;Why have you deceived me? You are Saul!&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>The king said to her, &#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid. What do you see?&#8221;</p><p class="reg">The woman said, &#8220;I see a ghostly figure

 coming up out of the earth.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>&#8220;What does he look like?&#8221; he asked.</p><p class="reg">&#8220;An old man wearing a robe is coming up,&#8221; she said.</p><p class="reg">Then Saul knew it was Samuel, and he bowed down and prostrated himself with his face to the ground.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Samuel said to Saul, &#8220;Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?&#8221;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;I am in great distress,&#8221; Saul said. &#8220;The Philistines are fighting against me, and God has departed from me. He no longer answers me, either by prophets or by dreams. So I have called on you to tell me what to do.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Samuel said, &#8220;Why do you consult me, now that the <span class="name">Lord</span> has departed from you and become your enemy? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> has done what he predicted through me. The <span class="name">Lord</span> has torn the kingdom out of your hands and given it to one of your neighbors&#8212;to David. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Because you did not obey the <span class="name">Lord</span> or carry out his fierce wrath against the Amalekites, the <span class="name">Lord</span> has done this to you today. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> will deliver both Israel and you into the hands of the Philistines, and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me. The <span class="name">Lord</span> will also give the army of Israel into the hands of the Philistines.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Immediately Saul fell full length on the ground, filled with fear because of Samuel&#8217;s words. His strength was gone, for he had eaten nothing all that day and all that night.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>When the woman came to Saul and saw that he was greatly shaken, she said, &#8220;Look, your servant has obeyed you. I took my life in my hands and did what you told me to do. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Now please listen to your servant and let me give you some food so you may eat and have the strength to go on your way.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>He refused and said, &#8220;I will not eat.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">But his men joined the woman in urging him, and he listened to them. He got up from the ground and sat on the couch.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>The woman had a fattened calf at the house, which she butchered at once. She took some flour, kneaded it and baked bread without yeast. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then she set it before Saul and his men, and they ate.
