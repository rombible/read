<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then they carried the ark into Dagon&#8217;s temple and set it beside Dagon. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>When the people of Ashdod rose early the next day, there was Dagon, fallen on his face on the ground before the ark of the <span class="name">Lord</span>! They took Dagon and put him back in his place. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But the following morning when they rose, there was Dagon, fallen on his face on the ground before the ark of the <span class="name">Lord</span>! His head and hands had been broken off and were lying on the threshold; only his body remained. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>That is why to this day neither the priests of Dagon nor any others who enter Dagon&#8217;s temple at Ashdod step on the threshold.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>When the people of Ashdod saw what was happening, they said, &#8220;The ark of the god of Israel must not stay here with us, because his hand is heavy on us and on Dagon our god.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So they called together all the rulers of the Philistines and asked them, &#8220;What shall we do with the ark of the god of Israel?&#8221;</p><p class="reg">They answered, &#8220;Have the ark of the god of Israel moved to Gath.&#8221; So they moved the ark of the God of Israel.</p>
