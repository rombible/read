 two years.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Saul chose three thousand men from Israel; two thousand were with him at Mikmash and in the hill country of Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan at Gibeah in Benjamin.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Jonathan attacked the Philistine outpost at Geba, and the Philistines heard about it. Then Saul had the trumpet blown throughout the land and said, &#8220;Let the Hebrews hear!&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So all Israel heard the news: &#8220;Saul has attacked the Philistine outpost, and now Israel has become obnoxious to the Philistines.&#8221; And the people were summoned to join Saul at Gilgal.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>The Philistines assembled to fight Israel, with three thousand
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some Septuagint manuscripts and Syriac; Hebrew thirty thousand">c</a></sup></span>
 chariots, six thousand charioteers, and soldiers as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They went up and camped at Mikmash, east of Beth Aven. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>When the Israelites saw that their situation was critical and that their army was hard pressed, they hid in caves and thickets, among the rocks, and in pits and cisterns. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Some Hebrews even crossed the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead.</p><p class="reg">Saul remained at Gilgal, and all the troops with him were quaking with fear. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>He waited seven days, the time set by Samuel; but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and Saul&#8217;s men began to scatter. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So he said, &#8220;Bring me the burnt offering and the fellowship offerings.&#8221; And Saul offered up the burnt offering. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Just as he finished making the offering, Samuel arrived, and Saul went out to greet him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8220;What have you done?&#8221; asked Samuel.</p><p class="reg">Saul replied, &#8220;When I saw that the men were scattering, and that you did not come at the set time, and that the Philistines were assembling at Mikmash, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>I thought, &#8216;Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not sought the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s favor.&#8217; So I felt compelled to offer the burnt offering.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8220;You have done a foolish thing,&#8221; Samuel said. &#8220;You have not kept the command the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God gave you; if you had, he would have established your kingdom over Israel for all time. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But now your kingdom will not endure; the <span class="name">Lord</span> has sought out a man after his own heart and appointed him ruler of his people, because you have not kept the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s command.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then Samuel left Gilgal

 and went up to Gibeah in Benjamin, and Saul counted the men who were with him. They numbered about six hundred.</p>

 in Benjamin, while the Philistines camped at Mikmash. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Raiding parties went out from the Philistine camp in three detachments. One turned toward Ophrah in the vicinity of Shual,

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Not a blacksmith could be found in the whole land of Israel, because the Philistines had said, &#8220;Otherwise the Hebrews will make swords or spears!&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So all Israel went down to the Philistines to have their plow points, mattocks, axes and sickles

 sharpened. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>The price was two-thirds of a shekel

 for sharpening plow points and mattocks, and a third of a shekel

 for sharpening forks and axes and for repointing goads.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So on the day of the battle not a soldier with Saul and Jonathan had a sword or spear in his hand; only Saul and his son Jonathan had them.</p>
