The Israelites camped at Ebenezer, and the Philistines at Aphek. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>The Philistines deployed their forces to meet Israel, and as the battle spread, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand of them on the battlefield. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>When the soldiers returned to camp, the elders of Israel asked, &#8220;Why did the <span class="name">Lord</span> bring defeat on us today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s covenant from Shiloh, so that he may go with us and save us from the hand of our enemies.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So the people sent men to Shiloh, and they brought back the ark of the covenant of the <span class="name">Lord</span> Almighty, who is enthroned between the cherubim. And Eli&#8217;s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>When the ark of the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s covenant came into the camp, all Israel raised such a great shout that the ground shook. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Hearing the uproar, the Philistines asked, &#8220;What&#8217;s all this shouting in the Hebrew camp?&#8221;</p><p class="reg">When they learned that the ark of the <span class="name">Lord</span> had come into the camp, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>the Philistines were afraid. &#8220;A god has
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or ''Gods have (see Septuagint)">a</a></sup></span>
 come into the camp,&#8221; they said. &#8220;Oh no! Nothing like this has happened before. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>We&#8217;re doomed! Who will deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? They are the gods who struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Be strong, Philistines! Be men, or you will be subject to the Hebrews, as they have been to you. Be men, and fight!&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So the Philistines fought, and the Israelites were defeated and every man fled to his tent. The slaughter was very great; Israel lost thirty thousand foot soldiers.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Eli heard the outcry and asked, &#8220;What is the meaning of this uproar?&#8221;</p><p class="reg">The man hurried over to Eli,
