<p class="sectionhead">The Sin and Doom of Ungodly People</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jude/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Dear friends, although I was very eager to write to you about the salvation we share, I felt compelled to write and urge you to contend for the faith that was once for all entrusted to God&#8217;s holy people.

 at one time delivered his people out of Egypt, but later destroyed those who did not believe. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jude/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And the angels who did not keep their positions of authority but abandoned their proper dwelling&#8212;these he has kept in darkness, bound with everlasting chains for judgment on the great Day. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jude/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jude/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>In the very same way, on the strength of their dreams these ungodly people pollute their own bodies, reject authority and heap abuse on celestial beings.
