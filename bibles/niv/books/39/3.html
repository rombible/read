Then suddenly the Lord you are seeking will come to his temple; the messenger of the covenant, whom you desire, will come,&#8221; says the <span class="name">Lord</span> Almighty.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>But who can endure the day of his coming? Who can stand when he appears? For he will be like a refiner&#8217;s fire or a launderer&#8217;s soap. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; he will purify the Levites and refine them like gold and silver. Then the <span class="name">Lord</span> will have men who will bring offerings in righteousness, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem will be acceptable to the <span class="name">Lord</span>, as in days gone by, as in former years.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8220;So I will come to put you on trial. I will be quick to testify against sorcerers, adulterers and perjurers, against those who defraud laborers of their wages, who oppress the widows and the fatherless, and deprive the foreigners among you of justice, but do not fear me,&#8221; says the <span class="name">Lord</span> Almighty.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Breaking Covenant by Withholding Tithes</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>&#8220;I the <span class="name">Lord</span> do not change. So you, the descendants of Jacob, are not destroyed. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Ever since the time of your ancestors you have turned away from my decrees and have not kept them. Return to me, and I will return to you,&#8221; says the <span class="name">Lord</span> Almighty.</p><p class="reg">&#8220;But you ask, &#8216;How are we to return?&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8220;Will a mere mortal rob God? Yet you rob me.</p><p class="reg">&#8220;But you ask, &#8216;How are we robbing you?&#8217;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;In tithes and offerings. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>You are under a curse&#8212;your whole nation&#8212;because you are robbing me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. Test me in this,&#8221; says the <span class="name">Lord</span> Almighty, &#8220;and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that there will not be room enough to store it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>I will prevent pests from devouring your crops, and the vines in your fields will not drop their fruit before it is ripe,&#8221; says the <span class="name">Lord</span> Almighty. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>&#8220;Then all the nations will call you blessed, for yours will be a delightful land,&#8221; says the <span class="name">Lord</span> Almighty.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Israel Speaks Arrogantly Against God</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8220;You have spoken arrogantly against me,&#8221; says the <span class="name">Lord</span>.</p><p class="reg">&#8220;Yet you ask, &#8216;What have we said against you?&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>&#8220;You have said, &#8216;It is futile to serve God. What do we gain by carrying out his requirements and going about like mourners before the <span class="name">Lord</span> Almighty? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But now we call the arrogant blessed. Certainly evildoers prosper, and even when they put God to the test, they get away with it.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>

A scroll of remembrance was written in his presence concerning those who feared the <span class="name">Lord</span> and honored his name.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>&#8220;On the day when I act,&#8221; says the <span class="name">Lord</span> Almighty, &#8220;they will be my treasured possession.
