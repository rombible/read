<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>If you do not listen, and if you do not resolve to honor my name,&#8221; says the <span class="name">Lord</span> Almighty, &#8220;I will send a curse on you, and I will curse your blessings. Yes, I have already cursed them, because you have not resolved to honor me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8220;Because of you I will rebuke your descendants
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or will blight your grain">a</a></sup></span>
; I will smear on your faces the dung from your festival sacrifices, and you will be carried off with it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And you will know that I have sent you this warning so that my covenant with Levi may continue,&#8221; says the <span class="name">Lord</span> Almighty. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8220;My covenant was with him, a covenant of life and peace, and I gave them to him; this called for reverence and he revered me and stood in awe of my name. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>True instruction was in his mouth and nothing false was found on his lips. He walked with me in peace and uprightness, and turned many from sin.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8220;For the lips of a priest ought to preserve knowledge, because he is the messenger of the <span class="name">Lord</span> Almighty and people seek instruction from his mouth. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But you have turned from the way and by your teaching have caused many to stumble; you have violated the covenant with Levi,&#8221; says the <span class="name">Lord</span> Almighty. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;So I have caused you to be despised and humiliated before all the people, because you have not followed my ways but have shown partiality in matters of the law.&#8221;</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Judah has been unfaithful.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>As for the man who does this, whoever he may be, may the <span class="name">Lord</span> remove him from the tents of Jacob

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>You ask, &#8220;Why?&#8221; It is because the <span class="name">Lord</span> is the witness between you and the wife of your youth.
