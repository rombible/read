<div class="chap"><p class="sectionhead">The Day of the Lord</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>While people are saying, &#8220;Peace and safety,&#8221; destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact you are doing.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Final Instructions</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now we ask you, brothers and sisters, to acknowledge those who work hard among you, who care for you in the Lord and who admonish you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Hold them in the highest regard in love because of their work. Live in peace with each other. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And we urge you, brothers and sisters, warn those who are idle and disruptive, encourage the disheartened, help the weak, be patient with everyone. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Make sure that nobody pays back wrong for wrong, but always strive to do what is good for each other and for everyone else.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Rejoice always, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>pray continually, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God&#8217;s will for you in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Do not quench the Spirit. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Do not treat prophecies with contempt 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>but test them all; hold on to what is good, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>reject every kind of evil.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through. May your whole spirit, soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>The one who calls you is faithful, and he will do it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Brothers and sisters, pray for us. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Greet all God&#8217;s people with a holy kiss.
