<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/16-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>so she said to Abram, &#8220;The <span class="name">Lord</span> has kept me from having children. Go, sleep with my slave; perhaps I can build a family through her.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">Abram agreed to what Sarai said. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/16-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So after Abram had been living in Canaan ten years, Sarai his wife took her Egyptian slave Hagar and gave her to her husband to be his wife.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/16-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>The angel of the <span class="name">Lord</span> found Hagar near a spring in the desert; it was the spring that is beside the road to Shur. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/16-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;Hagar, slave of Sarai, where have you come from, and where are you going?&#8221;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;I&#8217;m running away from my mistress Sarai,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/16-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then the angel of the <span class="name">Lord</span> told her, &#8220;Go back to your mistress and submit to her.&#8221;
