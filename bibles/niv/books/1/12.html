 I will give this land.&#8221; So he built an altar there to the <span class="name">Lord</span>, who had appeared to him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/12-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>From there he went on toward the hills east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/12-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>When Abram came to Egypt, the Egyptians saw that Sarai was a very beautiful woman.
