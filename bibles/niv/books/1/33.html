<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/33-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>He put the female servants and their children in front, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph in the rear. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/33-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>He himself went on ahead and bowed down to the ground seven times as he approached his brother.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/33-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But Esau ran to meet Jacob and embraced him; he threw his arms around his neck and kissed him. And they wept. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/33-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then Esau looked up and saw the women and children. &#8220;Who are these with you?&#8221; he asked.</p><p class="reg">Jacob answered, &#8220;They are the children God has graciously given your servant.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/33-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then the female servants and their children approached and bowed down. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/33-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Next, Leah and her children came and bowed down. Last of all came Joseph and Rachel, and they too bowed down.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/33-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Esau asked, &#8220;What&#8217;s the meaning of all these flocks and herds I met?&#8221;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;To find favor in your eyes, my lord,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/33-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But Esau said, &#8220;I already have plenty, my brother. Keep what you have for yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/33-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8220;No, please!&#8221; said Jacob. &#8220;If I have found favor in your eyes, accept this gift from me. For to see your face is like seeing the face of God, now that you have received me favorably. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/33-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Please accept the present that was brought to you, for God has been gracious to me and I have all I need.&#8221; And because Jacob insisted, Esau accepted it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/33-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then Esau said, &#8220;Let us be on our way; I&#8217;ll accompany you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/33-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>But Jacob said to him, &#8220;My lord knows that the children are tender and that I must care for the ewes and cows that are nursing their young. If they are driven hard just one day, all the animals will die. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/33-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So let my lord go on ahead of his servant, while I move along slowly at the pace of the flocks and herds before me and the pace of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/33-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Esau said, &#8220;Then let me leave some of my men with you.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;But why do that?&#8221; Jacob asked. &#8220;Just let me find favor in the eyes of my lord.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/33-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So that day Esau started on his way back to Seir. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/33-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Jacob, however, went to Sukkoth, where he built a place for himself and made shelters for his livestock. That is why the place is called Sukkoth.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/33-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>After Jacob came from Paddan Aram,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, Northwest Mesopotamia">b</a></sup></span>
 he arrived safely at the city of Shechem in Canaan and camped within sight of the city. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/33-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>For a hundred pieces of silver,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew hundred kesitahs; a kesitah was a unit of money of unknown weight and value.">c</a></sup></span>
 he bought from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem, the plot of ground where he pitched his tent. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/33-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>There he set up an altar and called it El Elohe Israel.
