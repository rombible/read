<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>The fear and dread of you will fall on all the beasts of the earth, and on all the birds in the sky, on every creature that moves along the ground, and on all the fish in the sea; they are given into your hands. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Everything that lives and moves about will be food for you. Just as I gave you the green plants, I now give you everything.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8220;But you must not eat meat that has its lifeblood still in it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And for your lifeblood I will surely demand an accounting. I will demand an accounting from every animal. And from each human being, too, I will demand an accounting for the life of another human being.</p>
<div class="stanza"><p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>&#8220;Whoever sheds human blood,</p><p class="line2">by humans shall their blood be shed;</p><p class="line1">for in the image of God</p><p class="line2">has God made mankind.</p></div>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;I now establish my covenant with you and with your descendants after you 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and with every living creature that was with you&#8212;the birds, the livestock and all the wild animals, all those that came out of the ark with you&#8212;every living creature on earth. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>I establish my covenant with you: Never again will all life be destroyed by the waters of a flood; never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And God said, &#8220;This is the sign of the covenant I am making between me and you and every living creature with you, a covenant for all generations to come:

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>I will remember my covenant between me and you and all living creatures of every kind. Never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all life.
