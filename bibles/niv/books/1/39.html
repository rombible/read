Potiphar, an Egyptian who was one of Pharaoh&#8217;s officials, the captain of the guard, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him there.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> was with Joseph so that he prospered, and he lived in the house of his Egyptian master. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>When his master saw that the <span class="name">Lord</span> was with him and that the <span class="name">Lord</span> gave him success in everything he did, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Joseph found favor in his eyes and became his attendant. Potiphar put him in charge of his household, and he entrusted to his care everything he owned. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>From the time he put him in charge of his household and of all that he owned, the <span class="name">Lord</span> blessed the household of the Egyptian because of Joseph. The blessing of the <span class="name">Lord</span> was on everything Potiphar had, both in the house and in the field. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So Potiphar left everything he had in Joseph&#8217;s care; with Joseph in charge, he did not concern himself with anything except the food he ate.</p><p class="reg">Now Joseph was well-built and handsome, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and after a while his master&#8217;s wife took notice of Joseph and said, &#8220;Come to bed with me!&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But he refused. &#8220;With me in charge,&#8221; he told her, &#8220;my master does not concern himself with anything in the house; everything he owns he has entrusted to my care. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>No one is greater in this house than I am. My master has withheld nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. How then could I do such a wicked thing and sin against God?&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And though she spoke to Joseph day after day, he refused to go to bed with her or even be with her.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>One day he went into the house to attend to his duties, and none of the household servants was inside. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>She caught him by his cloak and said, &#8220;Come to bed with me!&#8221; But he left his cloak in her hand and ran out of the house.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>When she saw that he had left his cloak in her hand and had run out of the house, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>she called her household servants. &#8220;Look,&#8221; she said to them, &#8220;this Hebrew has been brought to us to make sport of us! He came in here to sleep with me, but I screamed. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>When he heard me scream for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>She kept his cloak beside her until his master came home. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then she told him this story: &#8220;That Hebrew slave you brought us came to me to make sport of me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>But as soon as I screamed for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>When his master heard the story his wife told him, saying, &#8220;This is how your slave treated me,&#8221; he burned with anger. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Joseph&#8217;s master took him and put him in prison, the place where the king&#8217;s prisoners were confined.</p><p class="reg">But while Joseph was there in the prison, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>the <span class="name">Lord</span> was with him; he showed him kindness and granted him favor in the eyes of the prison warden. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So the warden put Joseph in charge of all those held in the prison, and he was made responsible for all that was done there. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>The warden paid no attention to anything under Joseph&#8217;s care, because the <span class="name">Lord</span> was with Joseph and gave him success in whatever he did.</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
