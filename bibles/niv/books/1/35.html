<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, &#8220;Get rid of the foreign gods you have with you, and purify yourselves and change your clothes. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then come, let us go up to Bethel, where I will build an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress and who has been with me wherever I have gone.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods they had and the rings in their ears, and Jacob buried them under the oak at Shechem. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then they set out, and the terror of God fell on the towns all around them so that no one pursued them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Jacob and all the people with him came to Luz (that is, Bethel) in the land of Canaan. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>There he built an altar, and he called the place El Bethel,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="El Bethel means God of Bethel.">a</a></sup></span>
 because it was there that God revealed himself to him when he was fleeing from his brother.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Now Deborah, Rebekah&#8217;s nurse, died and was buried under the oak outside Bethel. So it was named Allon Bakuth.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>After Jacob returned from Paddan Aram,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, Northwest Mesopotamia; also in verse 26">c</a></sup></span>
 God appeared to him again and blessed him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>God said to him, &#8220;Your name is Jacob,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Jacob means he grasps the heel, a Hebrew idiom for he deceives.">d</a></sup></span>
 but you will no longer be called Jacob; your name will be Israel.
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Israel probably means he struggles with God.">e</a></sup></span>
&#8221; So he named him Israel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And God said to him, &#8220;I am God Almighty

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then God went up from him at the place where he had talked with him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Jacob set up a stone pillar at the place where God had talked with him, and he poured out a drink offering on it; he also poured oil on it.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/35-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>As she breathed her last&#8212;for she was dying&#8212;she named her son Ben-Oni.
