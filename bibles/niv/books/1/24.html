<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>He said to the senior servant in his household, the one in charge of all that he had, &#8220;Put your hand under my thigh. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>I want you to swear by the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the God of heaven and the God of earth, that you will not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I am living, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>but will go to my country and my own relatives and get a wife for my son Isaac.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>The servant asked him, &#8220;What if the woman is unwilling to come back with me to this land? Shall I then take your son back to the country you came from?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>&#8220;Make sure that you do not take my son back there,&#8221; Abraham said.

 I will give this land&#8217;&#8212;he will send his angel before you so that you can get a wife for my son from there.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So the servant put his hand under the thigh of his master Abraham and swore an oath to him concerning this matter.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then the servant left, taking with him ten of his master&#8217;s camels loaded with all kinds of good things from his master. He set out for Aram Naharaim
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, Northwest Mesopotamia">b</a></sup></span>
 and made his way to the town of Nahor. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>He had the camels kneel down near the well outside the town; it was toward evening, the time the women go out to draw water.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then he prayed, &#8220;<span class="name">Lord</span>, God of my master Abraham, make me successful today, and show kindness to my master Abraham. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>See, I am standing beside this spring, and the daughters of the townspeople are coming out to draw water. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>May it be that when I say to a young woman, &#8216;Please let down your jar that I may have a drink,&#8217; and she says, &#8216;Drink, and I&#8217;ll water your camels too&#8217;&#8212;let her be the one you have chosen for your servant Isaac. By this I will know that you have shown kindness to my master.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Before he had finished praying, Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder. She was the daughter of Bethuel son of Milkah, who was the wife of Abraham&#8217;s brother Nahor. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>The woman was very beautiful, a virgin; no man had ever slept with her. She went down to the spring, filled her jar and came up again.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>The servant hurried to meet her and said, &#8220;Please give me a little water from your jar.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>&#8220;Drink, my lord,&#8221; she said, and quickly lowered the jar to her hands and gave him a drink.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>After she had given him a drink, she said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll draw water for your camels too, until they have had enough to drink.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough, ran back to the well to draw more water, and drew enough for all his camels. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Without saying a word, the man watched her closely to learn whether or not the <span class="name">Lord</span> had made his journey successful.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>When the camels had finished drinking, the man took out a gold nose ring weighing a beka

 and two gold bracelets weighing ten shekels.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Then he asked, &#8220;Whose daughter are you? Please tell me, is there room in your father&#8217;s house for us to spend the night?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>She answered him, &#8220;I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son that Milkah bore to Nahor.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And she added, &#8220;We have plenty of straw and fodder, as well as room for you to spend the night.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Then the man bowed down and worshiped the <span class="name">Lord</span>, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>saying, &#8220;Praise be to the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the God of my master Abraham, who has not abandoned his kindness and faithfulness to my master. As for me, the <span class="name">Lord</span> has led me on the journey to the house of my master&#8217;s relatives.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>The young woman ran and told her mother&#8217;s household about these things.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>As soon as he had seen the nose ring, and the bracelets on his sister&#8217;s arms, and had heard Rebekah tell what the man said to her, he went out to the man and found him standing by the camels near the spring. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>&#8220;Come, you who are blessed by the <span class="name">Lord</span>,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Why are you standing out here? I have prepared the house and a place for the camels.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>So the man went to the house, and the camels were unloaded. Straw and fodder were brought for the camels, and water for him and his men to wash their feet. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Then food was set before him, but he said, &#8220;I will not eat until I have told you what I have to say.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;Then tell us,&#8221; Laban said.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>So he said, &#8220;I am Abraham&#8217;s servant.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>&#8220;Then I asked my master, &#8216;What if the woman will not come back with me?&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>&#8220;He replied, &#8216;The <span class="name">Lord</span>, before whom I have walked faithfully, will send his angel with you and make your journey a success, so that you can get a wife for my son from my own clan and from my father&#8217;s family.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>&#8220;Before I finished praying in my heart, Rebekah came out, with her jar on her shoulder.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/24-47.htm"><b>47</b></a></span>&#8220;I asked her, &#8216;Whose daughter are you?&#8217;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;She said, &#8216;The daughter of Bethuel son of Nahor, whom Milkah bore to him.&#8217;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;Then I put the ring in her nose and the bracelets on her arms,
