<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then Joseph directed the physicians in his service to embalm his father Israel. So the physicians embalmed him, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>taking a full forty days, for that was the time required for embalming. And the Egyptians mourned for him seventy days.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>When the days of mourning had passed, Joseph said to Pharaoh&#8217;s court, &#8220;If I have found favor in your eyes, speak to Pharaoh for me. Tell him, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8216;My father made me swear an oath and said, &#8220;I am about to die; bury me in the tomb I dug for myself in the land of Canaan.&#8221; Now let me go up and bury my father; then I will return.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Pharaoh said, &#8220;Go up and bury your father, as he made you swear to do.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So Joseph went up to bury his father. All Pharaoh&#8217;s officials accompanied him&#8212;the dignitaries of his court and all the dignitaries of Egypt&#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>besides all the members of Joseph&#8217;s household and his brothers and those belonging to his father&#8217;s household. Only their children and their flocks and herds were left in Goshen.

 also went up with him. It was a very large company.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>When they reached the threshing floor of Atad, near the Jordan, they lamented loudly and bitterly; and there Joseph observed a seven-day period of mourning for his father. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>When the Canaanites who lived there saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, &#8220;The Egyptians are holding a solemn ceremony of mourning.&#8221; That is why that place near the Jordan is called Abel Mizraim.
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Abel Mizraim means mourning of the Egyptians.">b</a></sup></span>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So Jacob&#8217;s sons did as he had commanded them: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>They carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave in the field of Machpelah, near Mamre, which Abraham had bought along with the field as a burial place from Ephron the Hittite. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>After burying his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, together with his brothers and all the others who had gone with him to bury his father.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Joseph Reassures His Brothers</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>When Joseph&#8217;s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, &#8220;What if Joseph holds a grudge against us and pays us back for all the wrongs we did to him?&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So they sent word to Joseph, saying, &#8220;Your father left these instructions before he died: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>&#8216;This is what you are to say to Joseph: I ask you to forgive your brothers the sins and the wrongs they committed in treating you so badly.&#8217; Now please forgive the sins of the servants of the God of your father.&#8221; When their message came to him, Joseph wept.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>His brothers then came and threw themselves down before him. &#8220;We are your slaves,&#8221; they said.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>But Joseph said to them, &#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid. Am I in the place of God? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>So then, don&#8217;t be afraid. I will provide for you and your children.&#8221; And he reassured them and spoke kindly to them.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">The Death of Joseph</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Joseph stayed in Egypt, along with all his father&#8217;s family. He lived a hundred and ten years 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>and saw the third generation of Ephraim&#8217;s children. Also the children of Makir son of Manasseh were placed at birth on Joseph&#8217;s knees.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then Joseph said to his brothers, &#8220;I am about to die.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/50-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>And Joseph made the Israelites swear an oath and said, &#8220;God will surely come to your aid, and then you must carry my bones up from this place.&#8221;</p>
