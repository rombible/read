<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>the sons of God saw that the daughters of humans were beautiful, and they married any of them they chose.

 humans forever, for they are mortal
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or corrupt">b</a></sup></span>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>The Nephilim were on the earth in those days&#8212;and also afterward&#8212;when the sons of God went to the daughters of humans and had children by them.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> regretted that he had made human beings on the earth, and his heart was deeply troubled. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So the <span class="name">Lord</span> said, &#8220;I will wipe from the face of the earth the human race I have created&#8212;and with them the animals, the birds and the creatures that move along the ground&#8212;for I regret that I have made them.&#8221;

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now the earth was corrupt in God&#8217;s sight and was full of violence. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>God saw how corrupt the earth had become, for all the people on earth had corrupted their ways. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So God said to Noah, &#8220;I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. I am surely going to destroy both them and the earth.
