<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/23-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>She died at Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan, and Abraham went to mourn for Sarah and to weep over her.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/23-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then Abraham rose from beside his dead wife and spoke to the Hittites.
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or the descendants of Heth; also in verses 5, 7, 10, 16, 18 and 20">a</a></sup></span>
 He said, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/23-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8220;I am a foreigner and stranger among you. Sell me some property for a burial site here so I can bury my dead.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/23-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>The Hittites replied to Abraham, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/23-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>&#8220;Sir, listen to us. You are a mighty prince among us. Bury your dead in the choicest of our tombs. None of us will refuse you his tomb for burying your dead.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/23-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then Abraham rose and bowed down before the people of the land, the Hittites. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/23-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>He said to them, &#8220;If you are willing to let me bury my dead, then listen to me and intercede with Ephron son of Zohar on my behalf 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/23-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>so he will sell me the cave of Machpelah, which belongs to him and is at the end of his field. Ask him to sell it to me for the full price as a burial site among you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/23-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Ephron the Hittite was sitting among his people and he replied to Abraham in the hearing of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of his city. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/23-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8220;No, my lord,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Listen to me; I give
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or sell">b</a></sup></span>
 you the field, and I give
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or sell">c</a></sup></span>
 you the cave that is in it. I give
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or sell">d</a></sup></span>
 it to you in the presence of my people. Bury your dead.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/23-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Again Abraham bowed down before the people of the land 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/23-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>and he said to Ephron in their hearing, &#8220;Listen to me, if you will. I will pay the price of the field. Accept it from me so I can bury my dead there.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/23-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Ephron answered Abraham, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/23-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>&#8220;Listen to me, my lord; the land is worth four hundred shekels
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, about 10 pounds or about 4.6 kilograms">e</a></sup></span>
 of silver, but what is that between you and me? Bury your dead.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/23-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Abraham agreed to Ephron&#8217;s terms and weighed out for him the price he had named in the hearing of the Hittites: four hundred shekels of silver, according to the weight current among the merchants.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/23-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So Ephron&#8217;s field in Machpelah near Mamre&#8212;both the field and the cave in it, and all the trees within the borders of the field&#8212;was deeded
