<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Abraham looked up and saw three men standing nearby. When he saw them, he hurried from the entrance of his tent to meet them and bowed low to the ground.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>He said, &#8220;If I have found favor in your eyes, my lord,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or eyes, Lord">a</a></sup></span>
 do not pass your servant by. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Let a little water be brought, and then you may all wash your feet and rest under this tree. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Let me get you something to eat, so you can be refreshed and then go on your way&#8212;now that you have come to your servant.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;Very well,&#8221; they answered, &#8220;do as you say.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah. &#8220;Quick,&#8221; he said, &#8220;get three seahs
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, probably about 36 pounds or about 16 kilograms">b</a></sup></span>
 of the finest flour and knead it and bake some bread.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then he ran to the herd and selected a choice, tender calf and gave it to a servant, who hurried to prepare it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>He then brought some curds and milk and the calf that had been prepared, and set these before them. While they ate, he stood near them under a tree.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;Where is your wife Sarah?&#8221; they asked him.</p><p class="reg">&#8220;There, in the tent,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then one of them said, &#8220;I will surely return to you about this time next year, and Sarah your wife will have a son.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">Now Sarah was listening at the entrance to the tent, which was behind him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Abraham and Sarah were already very old, and Sarah was past the age of childbearing. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So Sarah laughed to herself as she thought, &#8220;After I am worn out and my lord is old, will I now have this pleasure?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then the <span class="name">Lord</span> said to Abraham, &#8220;Why did Sarah laugh and say, &#8216;Will I really have a child, now that I am old?&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Is anything too hard for the <span class="name">Lord</span>? I will return to you at the appointed time next year, and Sarah will have a son.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Sarah was afraid, so she lied and said, &#8220;I did not laugh.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">But he said, &#8220;Yes, you did laugh.&#8221;</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Abraham Pleads for Sodom</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>When the men got up to leave, they looked down toward Sodom, and Abraham walked along with them to see them on their way. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then the <span class="name">Lord</span> said, &#8220;Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Abraham will surely become a great and powerful nation, and all nations on earth will be blessed through him.
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or will use his name in blessings (see 48:20)">c</a></sup></span>
 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>For I have chosen him, so that he will direct his children and his household after him to keep the way of the <span class="name">Lord</span> by doing what is right and just, so that the <span class="name">Lord</span> will bring about for Abraham what he has promised him.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then the <span class="name">Lord</span> said, &#8220;The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sin so grievous 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me. If not, I will know.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>The men turned away and went toward Sodom, but Abraham remained standing before the <span class="name">Lord</span>.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Then Abraham approached him and said: &#8220;Will you sweep away the righteous with the wicked? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>What if there are fifty righteous people in the city? Will you really sweep it away and not spare

 the place for the sake of the fifty righteous people in it? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Far be it from you to do such a thing&#8212;to kill the righteous with the wicked, treating the righteous and the wicked alike. Far be it from you! Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> said, &#8220;If I find fifty righteous people in the city of Sodom, I will spare the whole place for their sake.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Then Abraham spoke up again: &#8220;Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, though I am nothing but dust and ashes,

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Then he said, &#8220;May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak.
