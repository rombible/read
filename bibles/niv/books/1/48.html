<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>When Jacob was told, &#8220;Your son Joseph has come to you,&#8221; Israel rallied his strength and sat up on the bed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Jacob said to Joseph, &#8220;God Almighty
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew El-Shaddai">a</a></sup></span>
 appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and there he blessed me 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and said to me, &#8216;I am going to make you fruitful and increase your numbers. I will make you a community of peoples, and I will give this land as an everlasting possession to your descendants after you.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8220;Now then, your two sons born to you in Egypt before I came to you here will be reckoned as mine; Ephraim and Manasseh will be mine, just as Reuben and Simeon are mine. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Any children born to you after them will be yours; in the territory they inherit they will be reckoned under the names of their brothers.

<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, Northwest Mesopotamia">b</a></sup></span>
 to my sorrow Rachel died in the land of Canaan while we were still on the way, a little distance from Ephrath. So I buried her there beside the road to Ephrath&#8221; (that is, Bethlehem).</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>When Israel saw the sons of Joseph, he asked, &#8220;Who are these?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;They are the sons God has given me here,&#8221; Joseph said to his father.</p><p class="reg">Then Israel said, &#8220;Bring them to me so I may bless them.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Now Israel&#8217;s eyes were failing because of old age, and he could hardly see. So Joseph brought his sons close to him, and his father kissed them and embraced them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Israel said to Joseph, &#8220;I never expected to see your face again, and now God has allowed me to see your children too.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then Joseph removed them from Israel&#8217;s knees and bowed down with his face to the ground. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And Joseph took both of them, Ephraim on his right toward Israel&#8217;s left hand and Manasseh on his left toward Israel&#8217;s right hand, and brought them close to him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But Israel reached out his right hand and put it on Ephraim&#8217;s head, though he was the younger, and crossing his arms, he put his left hand on Manasseh&#8217;s head, even though Manasseh was the firstborn.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then he blessed Joseph and said,</p><div class="stanza"><p class="line1">&#8220;May the God before whom my fathers</p><p class="line2">Abraham and Isaac walked faithfully,</p><p class="line1">the God who has been my shepherd</p><p class="line2">all my life to this day,</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>When Joseph saw his father placing his right hand on Ephraim&#8217;s head he was displeased; so he took hold of his father&#8217;s hand to move it from Ephraim&#8217;s head to Manasseh&#8217;s head. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Joseph said to him, &#8220;No, my father, this one is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>But his father refused and said, &#8220;I know, my son, I know.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>He blessed them that day and said,</p><div class="stanza"><p class="line1">&#8220;In your
