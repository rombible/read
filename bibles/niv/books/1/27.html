<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Isaac said, &#8220;I am now an old man and don&#8217;t know the day of my death. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Now then, get your equipment&#8212;your quiver and bow&#8212;and go out to the open country to hunt some wild game for me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Prepare me the kind of tasty food I like and bring it to me to eat, so that I may give you my blessing before I die.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now Rebekah was listening as Isaac spoke to his son Esau. When Esau left for the open country to hunt game and bring it back, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Rebekah said to her son Jacob, &#8220;Look, I overheard your father say to your brother Esau, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8216;Bring me some game and prepare me some tasty food to eat, so that I may give you my blessing in the presence of the <span class="name">Lord</span> before I die.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Now, my son, listen carefully and do what I tell you: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Go out to the flock and bring me two choice young goats, so I can prepare some tasty food for your father, just the way he likes it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then take it to your father to eat, so that he may give you his blessing before he dies.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, &#8220;But my brother Esau is a hairy man while I have smooth skin. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>What if my father touches me? I would appear to be tricking him and would bring down a curse on myself rather than a blessing.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>His mother said to him, &#8220;My son, let the curse fall on me. Just do what I say; go and get them for me.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So he went and got them and brought them to his mother, and she prepared some tasty food, just the way his father liked it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then Rebekah took the best clothes of Esau her older son, which she had in the house, and put them on her younger son Jacob. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>She also covered his hands and the smooth part of his neck with the goatskins. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then she handed to her son Jacob the tasty food and the bread she had made.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>He went to his father and said, &#8220;My father.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;Yes, my son,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;Who is it?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Jacob said to his father, &#8220;I am Esau your firstborn. I have done as you told me. Please sit up and eat some of my game, so that you may give me your blessing.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Isaac asked his son, &#8220;How did you find it so quickly, my son?&#8221;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;The <span class="name">Lord</span> your God gave me success,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then Isaac said to Jacob, &#8220;Come near so I can touch you, my son, to know whether you really are my son Esau or not.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Jacob went close to his father Isaac, who touched him and said, &#8220;The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>He did not recognize him, for his hands were hairy like those of his brother Esau; so he proceeded to bless him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>&#8220;Are you really my son Esau?&#8221; he asked.</p><p class="reg">&#8220;I am,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then he said, &#8220;My son, bring me some of your game to eat, so that I may give you my blessing.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">Jacob brought it to him and he ate; and he brought some wine and he drank. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Then his father Isaac said to him, &#8220;Come here, my son, and kiss me.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>So he went to him and kissed him. When Isaac caught the smell of his clothes, he blessed him and said,</p><div class="stanza"><p class="line1">&#8220;Ah, the smell of my son</p><p class="line2">is like the smell of a field</p><p class="line2">that the <span class="name">Lord</span> has blessed.</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>May God give you heaven&#8217;s dew</p><p class="line2">and earth&#8217;s richness&#8212;</p><p class="line2">an abundance of grain and new wine.</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>May nations serve you</p><p class="line2">and peoples bow down to you.</p><p class="line1">Be lord over your brothers,</p><p class="line2">and may the sons of your mother bow down to you.</p><p class="line1">May those who curse you be cursed</p><p class="line2">and those who bless you be blessed.&#8221;</p></div>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>After Isaac finished blessing him, and Jacob had scarcely left his father&#8217;s presence, his brother Esau came in from hunting. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>He too prepared some tasty food and brought it to his father. Then he said to him, &#8220;My father, please sit up and eat some of my game, so that you may give me your blessing.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>His father Isaac asked him, &#8220;Who are you?&#8221;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;I am your son,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;your firstborn, Esau.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Isaac trembled violently and said, &#8220;Who was it, then, that hunted game and brought it to me? I ate it just before you came and I blessed him&#8212;and indeed he will be blessed!&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>When Esau heard his father&#8217;s words, he burst out with a loud and bitter cry and said to his father, &#8220;Bless me&#8212;me too, my father!&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>But he said, &#8220;Your brother came deceitfully and took your blessing.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Esau said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t he rightly named Jacob

? This is the second time he has taken advantage of me: He took my birthright, and now he&#8217;s taken my blessing!&#8221; Then he asked, &#8220;Haven&#8217;t you reserved any blessing for me?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>Isaac answered Esau, &#8220;I have made him lord over you and have made all his relatives his servants, and I have sustained him with grain and new wine.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>Esau said to his father, &#8220;Do you have only one blessing, my father? Bless me too, my father!&#8221; Then Esau wept aloud.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>Esau held a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing his father had given him.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>When Rebekah was told what her older son Esau had said, she sent for her younger son Jacob and said to him, &#8220;Your brother Esau is planning to avenge himself by killing you.
