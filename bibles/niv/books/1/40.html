<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Pharaoh was angry with his two officials, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the same prison where Joseph was confined. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>The captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph, and he attended them.</p><p class="reg">After they had been in custody for some time, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>each of the two men&#8212;the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were being held in prison&#8212;had a dream the same night, and each dream had a meaning of its own.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>When Joseph came to them the next morning, he saw that they were dejected. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So he asked Pharaoh&#8217;s officials who were in custody with him in his master&#8217;s house, &#8220;Why do you look so sad today?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8220;We both had dreams,&#8221; they answered, &#8220;but there is no one to interpret them.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">Then Joseph said to them, &#8220;Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell me your dreams.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So the chief cupbearer told Joseph his dream. He said to him, &#8220;In my dream I saw a vine in front of me, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and on the vine were three branches. As soon as it budded, it blossomed, and its clusters ripened into grapes. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Pharaoh&#8217;s cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes, squeezed them into Pharaoh&#8217;s cup and put the cup in his hand.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>&#8220;This is what it means,&#8221; Joseph said to him. &#8220;The three branches are three days. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your position, and you will put Pharaoh&#8217;s cup in his hand, just as you used to do when you were his cupbearer. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But when all goes well with you, remember me and show me kindness; mention me to Pharaoh and get me out of this prison. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>I was forcibly carried off from the land of the Hebrews, and even here I have done nothing to deserve being put in a dungeon.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>When the chief baker saw that Joseph had given a favorable interpretation, he said to Joseph, &#8220;I too had a dream: On my head were three baskets of bread.
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or three wicker baskets">a</a></sup></span>
 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>In the top basket were all kinds of baked goods for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>&#8220;This is what it means,&#8221; Joseph said. &#8220;The three baskets are three days. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Within three days Pharaoh will lift off your head and impale your body on a pole. And the birds will eat away your flesh.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Now the third day was Pharaoh&#8217;s birthday, and he gave a feast for all his officials. He lifted up the heads of the chief cupbearer and the chief baker in the presence of his officials: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>He restored the chief cupbearer to his position, so that he once again put the cup into Pharaoh&#8217;s hand&#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>but he impaled the chief baker, just as Joseph had said to them in his interpretation.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>The chief cupbearer, however, did not remember Joseph; he forgot him.</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><A name="footnotes"></a><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotebot">Or <i>three wicker baskets</i></span><br><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
