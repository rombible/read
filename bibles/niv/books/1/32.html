<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>When Jacob saw them, he said, &#8220;This is the camp of God!&#8221; So he named that place Mahanaim.
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Mahanaim means two camps.">a</a></sup></span>
</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>He instructed them: &#8220;This is what you are to say to my lord Esau: &#8216;Your servant Jacob says, I have been staying with Laban and have remained there till now. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>I have cattle and donkeys, sheep and goats, male and female servants. Now I am sending this message to my lord, that I may find favor in your eyes.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>When the messengers returned to Jacob, they said, &#8220;We went to your brother Esau, and now he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>In great fear and distress Jacob divided the people who were with him into two groups,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or camps">b</a></sup></span>
 and the flocks and herds and camels as well. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>He thought, &#8220;If Esau comes and attacks one group,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or camp">c</a></sup></span>
 the group
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or camp">d</a></sup></span>
 that is left may escape.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then Jacob prayed, &#8220;O God of my father Abraham, God of my father Isaac, <span class="name">Lord</span>, you who said to me, &#8216;Go back to your country and your relatives, and I will make you prosper,&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>I am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness you have shown your servant. I had only my staff when I crossed this Jordan, but now I have become two camps. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Save me, I pray, from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am afraid he will come and attack me, and also the mothers with their children. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But you have said, &#8216;I will surely make you prosper and will make your descendants like the sand of the sea, which cannot be counted.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>He spent the night there, and from what he had with him he selected a gift for his brother Esau: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>thirty female camels with their young, forty cows and ten bulls, and twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>He put them in the care of his servants, each herd by itself, and said to his servants, &#8220;Go ahead of me, and keep some space between the herds.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>He instructed the one in the lead: &#8220;When my brother Esau meets you and asks, &#8216;Who do you belong to, and where are you going, and who owns all these animals in front of you?&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>then you are to say, &#8216;They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a gift sent to my lord Esau, and he is coming behind us.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>He also instructed the second, the third and all the others who followed the herds: &#8220;You are to say the same thing to Esau when you meet him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And be sure to say, &#8216;Your servant Jacob is coming behind us.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221; For he thought, &#8220;I will pacify him with these gifts I am sending on ahead; later, when I see him, perhaps he will receive me.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>So Jacob&#8217;s gifts went on ahead of him, but he himself spent the night in the camp.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Jacob Wrestles With God</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>That night Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two female servants and his eleven sons and crossed the ford of the Jabbok. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>After he had sent them across the stream, he sent over all his possessions. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>So Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him till daybreak. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>When the man saw that he could not overpower him, he touched the socket of Jacob&#8217;s hip so that his hip was wrenched as he wrestled with the man. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Then the man said, &#8220;Let me go, for it is daybreak.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">But Jacob replied, &#8220;I will not let you go unless you bless me.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>The man asked him, &#8220;What is your name?&#8221;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;Jacob,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then the man said, &#8220;Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Israel probably means he struggles with God.">e</a></sup></span>
 because you have struggled with God and with humans and have overcome.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Jacob said, &#8220;Please tell me your name.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">But he replied, &#8220;Why do you ask my name?&#8221; Then he blessed him there.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>So Jacob called the place Peniel,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Peniel means face of God.">f</a></sup></span>
 saying, &#8220;It is because I saw God face to face, and yet my life was spared.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>The sun rose above him as he passed Peniel,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew Penuel, a variant of Peniel">g</a></sup></span>
 and he was limping because of his hip. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Therefore to this day the Israelites do not eat the tendon attached to the socket of the hip, because the socket of Jacob&#8217;s hip was touched near the tendon.</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><A name="footnotes"></a><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotebot"><i>Mahanaim</i> means <i>two camps.</i></span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotebot">Or <i>camps</i></span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">c</span> <span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotebot">Or <i>camp</i></span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">d</span> <span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotebot">Or <i>camp</i></span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">e</span> <span class="fnverse">28</span> <span class="footnotebot"><i>Israel</i> probably means <i>he struggles with God.</i></span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">f</span> <span class="fnverse">30</span> <span class="footnotebot"><i>Peniel</i> means <i>face of God.</i></span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">g</span> <span class="fnverse">31</span> <span class="footnotebot">Hebrew <i>Penuel</i>, a variant of <i>Peniel</i></span><br><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
