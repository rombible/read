<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>This is the account of Jacob&#8217;s family line.</p><p class="reg">Joseph, a young man of seventeen, was tending the flocks with his brothers, the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, his father&#8217;s wives, and he brought their father a bad report about them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Now Israel loved Joseph more than any of his other sons, because he had been born to him in his old age; and he made an ornate

 robe for him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them, they hated him and could not speak a kind word to him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers, they hated him all the more. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>He said to them, &#8220;Listen to this dream I had: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>We were binding sheaves of grain out in the field when suddenly my sheaf rose and stood upright, while your sheaves gathered around mine and bowed down to it.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>His brothers said to him, &#8220;Do you intend to reign over us? Will you actually rule us?&#8221; And they hated him all the more because of his dream and what he had said.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then he had another dream, and he told it to his brothers. &#8220;Listen,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I had another dream, and this time the sun and moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>When he told his father as well as his brothers, his father rebuked him and said, &#8220;What is this dream you had? Will your mother and I and your brothers actually come and bow down to the ground before you?&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>His brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter in mind.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Joseph Sold by His Brothers</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now his brothers had gone to graze their father&#8217;s flocks near Shechem, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>and Israel said to Joseph, &#8220;As you know, your brothers are grazing the flocks near Shechem. Come, I am going to send you to them.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;Very well,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So he said to him, &#8220;Go and see if all is well with your brothers and with the flocks, and bring word back to me.&#8221; Then he sent him off from the Valley of Hebron.</p><p class="reg">When Joseph arrived at Shechem, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>a man found him wandering around in the fields and asked him, &#8220;What are you looking for?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>He replied, &#8220;I&#8217;m looking for my brothers. Can you tell me where they are grazing their flocks?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>&#8220;They have moved on from here,&#8221; the man answered. &#8220;I heard them say, &#8216;Let&#8217;s go to Dothan.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p><p class="reg">So Joseph went after his brothers and found them near Dothan. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>But they saw him in the distance, and before he reached them, they plotted to kill him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>&#8220;Here comes that dreamer!&#8221; they said to each other. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>&#8220;Come now, let&#8217;s kill him and throw him into one of these cisterns and say that a ferocious animal devoured him. Then we&#8217;ll see what comes of his dreams.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>When Reuben heard this, he tried to rescue him from their hands. &#8220;Let&#8217;s not take his life,&#8221; he said. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t shed any blood. Throw him into this cistern here in the wilderness, but don&#8217;t lay a hand on him.&#8221; Reuben said this to rescue him from them and take him back to his father.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe&#8212;the ornate robe he was wearing&#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>and they took him and threw him into the cistern. The cistern was empty; there was no water in it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>As they sat down to eat their meal, they looked up and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead. Their camels were loaded with spices, balm and myrrh, and they were on their way to take them down to Egypt.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Judah said to his brothers, &#8220;What will we gain if we kill our brother and cover up his blood? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Come, let&#8217;s sell him to the Ishmaelites and not lay our hands on him; after all, he is our brother, our own flesh and blood.&#8221; His brothers agreed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>So when the Midianite merchants came by, his brothers pulled Joseph up out of the cistern and sold him for twenty shekels
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, about 8 ounces or about 230 grams">b</a></sup></span>
 of silver to the Ishmaelites, who took him to Egypt.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>When Reuben returned to the cistern and saw that Joseph was not there, he tore his clothes. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>He went back to his brothers and said, &#8220;The boy isn&#8217;t there! Where can I turn now?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Then they got Joseph&#8217;s robe, slaughtered a goat and dipped the robe in the blood. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>They took the ornate robe back to their father and said, &#8220;We found this. Examine it to see whether it is your son&#8217;s robe.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>He recognized it and said, &#8220;It is my son&#8217;s robe! Some ferocious animal has devoured him. Joseph has surely been torn to pieces.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Then Jacob tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and mourned for his son many days. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>All his sons and daughters came to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. &#8220;No,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I will continue to mourn until I join my son in the grave.&#8221; So his father wept for him.</p>
