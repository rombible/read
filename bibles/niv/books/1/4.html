 made love to his wife Eve, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain.
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Cain sounds like the Hebrew for brought forth or acquired.">b</a></sup></span>
 She said, &#8220;With the help of the <span class="name">Lord</span> I have brought forth

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then the <span class="name">Lord</span> said to Cain, &#8220;Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast?

 While they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him.</p>
