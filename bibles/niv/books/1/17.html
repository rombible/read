<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew El-Shaddai">a</a></sup></span>
; walk before me faithfully and be blameless. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then I will make my covenant between me and you and will greatly increase your numbers.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Abram fell facedown, and God said to him, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8220;As for me, this is my covenant with you: You will be the father of many nations.

; your name will be Abraham,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Abraham probably means father of many.">c</a></sup></span>
 for I have made you a father of many nations. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>I will make you very fruitful; I will make nations of you, and kings will come from you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>I will establish my covenant as an everlasting covenant between me and you and your descendants after you for the generations to come, to be your God and the God of your descendants after you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>The whole land of Canaan, where you now reside as a foreigner, I will give as an everlasting possession to you and your descendants after you; and I will be their God.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then God said to Abraham, &#8220;As for you, you must keep my covenant, you and your descendants after you for the generations to come. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>This is my covenant with you and your descendants after you, the covenant you are to keep: Every male among you shall be circumcised. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>You are to undergo circumcision, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>For the generations to come every male among you who is eight days old must be circumcised, including those born in your household or bought with money from a foreigner&#8212;those who are not your offspring. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Whether born in your household or bought with your money, they must be circumcised. My covenant in your flesh is to be an everlasting covenant. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Any uncircumcised male, who has not been circumcised in the flesh, will be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>God also said to Abraham, &#8220;As for Sarai your wife, you are no longer to call her Sarai; her name will be Sarah.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Abraham fell facedown; he laughed and said to himself, &#8220;Will a son be born to a man a hundred years old? Will Sarah bear a child at the age of ninety?&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And Abraham said to God, &#8220;If only Ishmael might live under your blessing!&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then God said, &#8220;Yes, but your wife Sarah will bear you a son, and you will call him Isaac.

 I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him.
