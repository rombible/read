<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Jacob became angry with her and said, &#8220;Am I in the place of God, who has kept you from having children?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then she said, &#8220;Here is Bilhah, my servant. Sleep with her so that she can bear children for me and I too can build a family through her.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So she gave him her servant Bilhah as a wife. Jacob slept with her,

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then Rachel said, &#8220;God has vindicated me; he has listened to my plea and given me a son.&#8221; Because of this she named him Dan.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Rachel&#8217;s servant Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then Rachel said, &#8220;I have had a great struggle with my sister, and I have won.&#8221; So she named him Naphtali.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But she said to her, &#8220;Wasn&#8217;t it enough that you took away my husband?

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>God listened to Leah, and she became pregnant and bore Jacob a fifth son.

<p class="sectionhead">Jacob&#8217;s Flocks Increase</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>After Rachel gave birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, &#8220;Send me on my way so I can go back to my own homeland. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Give me my wives and children, for whom I have served you, and I will be on my way. You know how much work I&#8217;ve done for you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>But Laban said to him, &#8220;If I have found favor in your eyes, please stay. I have learned by divination that the <span class="name">Lord</span> has blessed me because of you.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>He added, &#8220;Name your wages, and I will pay them.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Jacob said to him, &#8220;You know how I have worked for you and how your livestock has fared under my care. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>The little you had before I came has increased greatly, and the <span class="name">Lord</span> has blessed you wherever I have been. But now, when may I do something for my own household?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>&#8220;What shall I give you?&#8221; he asked.</p><p class="reg">&#8220;Don&#8217;t give me anything,&#8221; Jacob replied. &#8220;But if you will do this one thing for me, I will go on tending your flocks and watching over them: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Let me go through all your flocks today and remove from them every speckled or spotted sheep, every dark-colored lamb and every spotted or speckled goat. They will be my wages. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>And my honesty will testify for me in the future, whenever you check on the wages you have paid me. Any goat in my possession that is not speckled or spotted, or any lamb that is not dark-colored, will be considered stolen.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>&#8220;Agreed,&#8221; said Laban. &#8220;Let it be as you have said.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>That same day he removed all the male goats that were streaked or spotted, and all the speckled or spotted female goats (all that had white on them) and all the dark-colored lambs, and he placed them in the care of his sons. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Then he put a three-day journey between himself and Jacob, while Jacob continued to tend the rest of Laban&#8217;s flocks.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>Jacob, however, took fresh-cut branches from poplar, almond and plane trees and made white stripes on them by peeling the bark and exposing the white inner wood of the branches. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>Then he placed the peeled branches in all the watering troughs, so that they would be directly in front of the flocks when they came to drink. When the flocks were in heat and came to drink, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>they mated in front of the branches. And they bore young that were streaked or speckled or spotted. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>Jacob set apart the young of the flock by themselves, but made the rest face the streaked and dark-colored animals that belonged to Laban. Thus he made separate flocks for himself and did not put them with Laban&#8217;s animals. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>Whenever the stronger females were in heat, Jacob would place the branches in the troughs in front of the animals so they would mate near the branches, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>but if the animals were weak, he would not place them there. So the weak animals went to Laban and the strong ones to Jacob. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>In this way the man grew exceedingly prosperous and came to own large flocks, and female and male servants, and camels and donkeys.</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><A name="footnotes"></a><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotebot"><i>Dan</i> here means <i>he has vindicated.</i></span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotebot"><i>Naphtali</i> means <i>my struggle.</i></span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">c</span> <span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotebot">Or <i>&#8220;A troop is coming!&#8221;</i></span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">d</span> <span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotebot"><i>Gad</i> can mean <i>good fortune</i> or <i>a troop.</i></span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">e</span> <span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotebot"><i>Asher</i> means <i>happy.</i></span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">f</span> <span class="fnverse">18</span> <span class="footnotebot"><i>Issachar</i> sounds like the Hebrew for <i>reward.</i></span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">g</span> <span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotebot"><i>Zebulun</i> probably means <i>honor.</i></span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">h</span> <span class="fnverse">24</span> <span class="footnotebot"><i>Joseph</i> means <i>may he add.</i></span><br><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
