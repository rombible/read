<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Abram had become very wealthy in livestock and in silver and gold.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>From the Negev he went from place to place until he came to Bethel, to the place between Bethel and Ai where his tent had been earlier 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and where he had first built an altar. There Abram called on the name of the <span class="name">Lord</span>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now Lot, who was moving about with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But the land could not support them while they stayed together, for their possessions were so great that they were not able to stay together. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And quarreling arose between Abram&#8217;s herders and Lot&#8217;s. The Canaanites and Perizzites were also living in the land at that time.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So Abram said to Lot, &#8220;Let&#8217;s not have any quarreling between you and me, or between your herders and mine, for we are close relatives. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Is not the whole land before you? Let&#8217;s part company. If you go to the left, I&#8217;ll go to the right; if you go to the right, I&#8217;ll go to the left.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Lot looked around and saw that the whole plain of the Jordan toward Zoar was well watered, like the garden of the <span class="name">Lord</span>, like the land of Egypt. (This was before the <span class="name">Lord</span> destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.) 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So Lot chose for himself the whole plain of the Jordan and set out toward the east. The two men parted company: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Abram lived in the land of Canaan, while Lot lived among the cities of the plain and pitched his tents near Sodom. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Now the people of Sodom were wicked and were sinning greatly against the <span class="name">Lord</span>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> said to Abram after Lot had parted from him, &#8220;Look around from where you are, to the north and south, to the east and west. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>All the land that you see I will give to you and your offspring

 forever. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>I will make your offspring like the dust of the earth, so that if anyone could count the dust, then your offspring could be counted. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Go, walk through the length and breadth of the land, for I am giving it to you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/13-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>So Abram went to live near the great trees of Mamre at Hebron, where he pitched his tents.
