<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Traditionally judged">a</a></sup></span>
 there was a famine in the land. So a man from Bethlehem in Judah, together with his wife and two sons, went to live for a while in the country of Moab. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>The man&#8217;s name was Elimelek, his wife&#8217;s name was Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Kilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem, Judah. And they went to Moab and lived there.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Now Elimelek, Naomi&#8217;s husband, died, and she was left with her two sons. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>They married Moabite women, one named Orpah and the other Ruth. After they had lived there about ten years, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>both Mahlon and Kilion also died, and Naomi was left without her two sons and her husband.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Naomi and Ruth Return to Bethlehem</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>When Naomi heard in Moab that the <span class="name">Lord</span> had come to the aid of his people by providing food for them, she and her daughters-in-law prepared to return home from there. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>With her two daughters-in-law she left the place where she had been living and set out on the road that would take them back to the land of Judah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, &#8220;Go back, each of you, to your mother&#8217;s home. May the <span class="name">Lord</span> show you kindness, as you have shown kindness to your dead husbands and to me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>May the <span class="name">Lord</span> grant that each of you will find rest in the home of another husband.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">Then she kissed them goodbye and they wept aloud 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and said to her, &#8220;We will go back with you to your people.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But Naomi said, &#8220;Return home, my daughters. Why would you come with me? Am I going to have any more sons, who could become your husbands? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Return home, my daughters; I am too old to have another husband. Even if I thought there was still hope for me&#8212;even if I had a husband tonight and then gave birth to sons&#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>would you wait until they grew up? Would you remain unmarried for them? No, my daughters. It is more bitter for me than for you, because the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s hand has turned against me!&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>At this they wept aloud again. Then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye, but Ruth clung to her.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>&#8220;Look,&#8221; said Naomi, &#8220;your sister-in-law is going back to her people and her gods. Go back with her.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But Ruth replied, &#8220;Don&#8217;t urge me to leave you or to turn back from you. Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried. May the <span class="name">Lord</span> deal with me, be it ever so severely, if even death separates you and me.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>When Naomi realized that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped urging her.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>So the two women went on until they came to Bethlehem. When they arrived in Bethlehem, the whole town was stirred because of them, and the women exclaimed, &#8220;Can this be Naomi?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t call me Naomi,

&#8221; she told them. &#8220;Call me Mara,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Mara means bitter.">c</a></sup></span>
 because the Almighty
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew Shaddai; also in verse 21">d</a></sup></span>
 has made my life very bitter. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>I went away full, but the <span class="name">Lord</span> has brought me back empty. Why call me Naomi? The <span class="name">Lord</span> has afflicted

 me; the Almighty has brought misfortune upon me.&#8221;</p>
