<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi, &#8220;Let me go to the fields and pick up the leftover grain behind anyone in whose eyes I find favor.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">Naomi said to her, &#8220;Go ahead, my daughter.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So she went out, entered a field and began to glean behind the harvesters. As it turned out, she was working in a field belonging to Boaz, who was from the clan of Elimelek.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Just then Boaz arrived from Bethlehem and greeted the harvesters, &#8220;The <span class="name">Lord</span> be with you!&#8221;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;The <span class="name">Lord</span> bless you!&#8221; they answered.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Boaz asked the overseer of his harvesters, &#8220;Who does that young woman belong to?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>The overseer replied, &#8220;She is the Moabite who came back from Moab with Naomi. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>She said, &#8216;Please let me glean and gather among the sheaves behind the harvesters.&#8217; She came into the field and has remained here from morning till now, except for a short rest in the shelter.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So Boaz said to Ruth, &#8220;My daughter, listen to me. Don&#8217;t go and glean in another field and don&#8217;t go away from here. Stay here with the women who work for me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Watch the field where the men are harvesting, and follow along after the women. I have told the men not to lay a hand on you. And whenever you are thirsty, go and get a drink from the water jars the men have filled.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>At this, she bowed down with her face to the ground. She asked him, &#8220;Why have I found such favor in your eyes that you notice me&#8212;a foreigner?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Boaz replied, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been told all about what you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband&#8212;how you left your father and mother and your homeland and came to live with a people you did not know before. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>May the <span class="name">Lord</span> repay you for what you have done. May you be richly rewarded by the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8220;May I continue to find favor in your eyes, my lord,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You have put me at ease by speaking kindly to your servant&#8212;though I do not have the standing of one of your servants.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>At mealtime Boaz said to her, &#8220;Come over here. Have some bread and dip it in the wine vinegar.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">When she sat down with the harvesters, he offered her some roasted grain. She ate all she wanted and had some left over. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>As she got up to glean, Boaz gave orders to his men, &#8220;Let her gather among the sheaves and don&#8217;t reprimand her. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Even pull out some stalks for her from the bundles and leave them for her to pick up, and don&#8217;t rebuke her.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So Ruth gleaned in the field until evening. Then she threshed the barley she had gathered, and it amounted to about an ephah.
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, probably about 30 pounds or about 13 kilograms">a</a></sup></span>
 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>She carried it back to town, and her mother-in-law saw how much she had gathered. Ruth also brought out and gave her what she had left over after she had eaten enough.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Her mother-in-law asked her, &#8220;Where did you glean today? Where did you work? Blessed be the man who took notice of you!&#8221;</p><p class="reg">Then Ruth told her mother-in-law about the one at whose place she had been working. &#8220;The name of the man I worked with today is Boaz,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>&#8220;The <span class="name">Lord</span> bless him!&#8221; Naomi said to her daughter-in-law. &#8220;He has not stopped showing his kindness to the living and the dead.&#8221; She added, &#8220;That man is our close relative; he is one of our guardian-redeemers.
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="The Hebrew word for guardian-redeemer is a legal term for one who has the obligation to redeem a relative in serious difficulty (see Lev. 25:25-55).">b</a></sup></span>
&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then Ruth the Moabite said, &#8220;He even said to me, &#8216;Stay with my workers until they finish harvesting all my grain.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, &#8220;It will be good for you, my daughter, to go with the women who work for him, because in someone else&#8217;s field you might be harmed.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>So Ruth stayed close to the women of Boaz to glean until the barley and wheat harvests were finished.
