<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="The Hebrew word for guardian-redeemer is a legal term for one who has the obligation to redeem a relative in serious difficulty (see Lev. 25:25-55); also in verses 3, 6, 8 and 14.">a</a></sup></span>
 he had mentioned came along. Boaz said, &#8220;Come over here, my friend, and sit down.&#8221; So he went over and sat down.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Boaz took ten of the elders of the town and said, &#8220;Sit here,&#8221; and they did so. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then he said to the guardian-redeemer, &#8220;Naomi, who has come back from Moab, is selling the piece of land that belonged to our relative Elimelek. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>I thought I should bring the matter to your attention and suggest that you buy it in the presence of these seated here and in the presence of the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, do so. But if you

 will not, tell me, so I will know. For no one has the right to do it except you, and I am next in line.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;I will redeem it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then Boaz said, &#8220;On the day you buy the land from Naomi, you also acquire Ruth the Moabite, the

 dead man&#8217;s widow, in order to maintain the name of the dead with his property.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>At this, the guardian-redeemer said, &#8220;Then I cannot redeem it because I might endanger my own estate. You redeem it yourself. I cannot do it.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>(Now in earlier times in Israel, for the redemption and transfer of property to become final, one party took off his sandal and gave it to the other. This was the method of legalizing transactions in Israel.)</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So the guardian-redeemer said to Boaz, &#8220;Buy it yourself.&#8221; And he removed his sandal.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then Boaz announced to the elders and all the people, &#8220;Today you are witnesses that I have bought from Naomi all the property of Elimelek, Kilion and Mahlon. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>I have also acquired Ruth the Moabite, Mahlon&#8217;s widow, as my wife, in order to maintain the name of the dead with his property, so that his name will not disappear from among his family or from his hometown. Today you are witnesses!&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then the elders and all the people at the gate said, &#8220;We are witnesses. May the <span class="name">Lord</span> make the woman who is coming into your home like Rachel and Leah, who together built up the family of Israel. May you have standing in Ephrathah and be famous in Bethlehem. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Through the offspring the <span class="name">Lord</span> gives you by this young woman, may your family be like that of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah.&#8221;</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Naomi Gains a Son</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife. When he made love to her, the <span class="name">Lord</span> enabled her to conceive, and she gave birth to a son. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>The women said to Naomi: &#8220;Praise be to the <span class="name">Lord</span>, who this day has not left you without a guardian-redeemer. May he become famous throughout Israel! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>He will renew your life and sustain you in your old age. For your daughter-in-law, who loves you and who is better to you than seven sons, has given him birth.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then Naomi took the child in her arms and cared for him.
