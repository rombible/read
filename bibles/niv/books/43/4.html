<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>although in fact it was not Jesus who baptized, but his disciples. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So he left Judea and went back once more to Galilee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Now he had to go through Samaria. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So he came to a town in Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of ground Jacob had given to his son Joseph. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Jacob&#8217;s well was there, and Jesus, tired as he was from the journey, sat down by the well. It was about noon.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, <span class="red">&#8220;Will you give me a drink?&#8221;</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>(His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.)</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>The Samaritan woman said to him, &#8220;You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a drink?&#8221; (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.

)</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Jesus answered her, <span class="red">&#8220;If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked him and he would have given you living water.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8220;Sir,&#8221; the woman said, &#8220;you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where can you get this living water? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did also his sons and his livestock?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Jesus answered, <span class="red">&#8220;Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again,</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span><span class="red">but whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give them will become in them a spring of water welling up to eternal life.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>The woman said to him, &#8220;Sir, give me this water so that I won&#8217;t get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>He told her, <span class="red">&#8220;Go, call your husband and come back.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>&#8220;I have no husband,&#8221; she replied.</p><p class="reg">Jesus said to her, <span class="red">&#8220;You are right when you say you have no husband.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span><span class="red">The fact is, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. What you have just said is quite true.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>&#8220;Sir,&#8221; the woman said, &#8220;I can see that you are a prophet. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;Woman,&#8221;</span> Jesus replied, <span class="red">&#8220;believe me, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span><span class="red">You Samaritans worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span><span class="red">Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in the Spirit and in truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span><span class="red">God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in truth.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>The woman said, &#8220;I know that Messiah&#8221; (called Christ) &#8220;is coming. When he comes, he will explain everything to us.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Then Jesus declared, <span class="red">&#8220;I, the one speaking to you&#8212;I am he.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="sectionhead">The Disciples Rejoin Jesus</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Just then his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking with a woman. But no one asked, &#8220;What do you want?&#8221; or &#8220;Why are you talking with her?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then, leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to the people, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>&#8220;Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Messiah?&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>They came out of the town and made their way toward him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Meanwhile his disciples urged him, &#8220;Rabbi, eat something.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>But he said to them, <span class="red">&#8220;I have food to eat that you know nothing about.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Then his disciples said to each other, &#8220;Could someone have brought him food?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;My food,&#8221;</span> said Jesus, <span class="red">&#8220;is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span><span class="red">Don&#8217;t you have a saying, &#8216;It&#8217;s still four months until harvest&#8217;? I tell you, open your eyes and look at the fields! They are ripe for harvest.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span><span class="red">Even now the one who reaps draws a wage and harvests a crop for eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper may be glad together.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span><span class="red">Thus the saying &#8216;One sows and another reaps&#8217; is true.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span><span class="red">I sent you to reap what you have not worked for. Others have done the hard work, and you have reaped the benefits of their labor.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="sectionhead">Many Samaritans Believe</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman&#8217;s testimony, &#8220;He told me everything I ever did.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them, and he stayed two days. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>And because of his words many more became believers.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>They said to the woman, &#8220;We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the Savior of the world.&#8221;</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Jesus Heals an Official&#8217;s Son</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>After the two days he left for Galilee. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>(Now Jesus himself had pointed out that a prophet has no honor in his own country.) 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>When he arrived in Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him. They had seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the Passover Festival, for they also had been there.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span>Once more he visited Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. And there was a certain royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-47.htm"><b>47</b></a></span>When this man heard that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judea, he went to him and begged him to come and heal his son, who was close to death.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-51.htm"><b>51</b></a></span>While he was still on the way, his servants met him with the news that his boy was living.
