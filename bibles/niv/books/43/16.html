<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span><span class="red">They will put you out of the synagogue; in fact, the time is coming when anyone who kills you will think they are offering a service to God.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span><span class="red">They will do such things because they have not known the Father or me.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span><span class="red">I have told you this, so that when their time comes you will remember that I warned you about them. I did not tell you this from the beginning because I was with you,</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span><span class="red">but now I am going to him who sent me. None of you asks me, &#8216;Where are you going?&#8217;</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span><span class="red">Rather, you are filled with grief because I have said these things.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span><span class="red">But very truly I tell you, it is for your good that I am going away. Unless I go away, the Advocate will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><span class="red">When he comes, he will prove the world to be in the wrong about sin and righteousness and judgment:</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span><span class="red">about sin, because people do not believe in me;</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><span class="red">about righteousness, because I am going to the Father, where you can see me no longer;</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span><span class="red">and about judgment, because the prince of this world now stands condemned.</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;I have much more to say to you, more than you can now bear.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span><span class="red">But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all the truth. He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he will tell you what is yet to come.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span><span class="red">He will glorify me because it is from me that he will receive what he will make known to you.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span><span class="red">All that belongs to the Father is mine. That is why I said the Spirit will receive from me what he will make known to you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>At this, some of his disciples said to one another, &#8220;What does he mean by saying, <span class="red">&#8216;In a little while you will see me no more, and then after a little while you will see me,&#8217;</span> and <span class="red">&#8216;Because I am going to the Father&#8217;</span>?&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>They kept asking, &#8220;What does he mean by <span class="red">&#8216;a little while&#8217;</span>? We don&#8217;t understand what he is saying.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Jesus saw that they wanted to ask him about this, so he said to them, <span class="red">&#8220;Are you asking one another what I meant when I said, &#8216;In a little while you will see me no more, and then after a little while you will see me&#8217;?</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span><span class="red">Very truly I tell you, you will weep and mourn while the world rejoices. You will grieve, but your grief will turn to joy.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span><span class="red">A woman giving birth to a child has pain because her time has come; but when her baby is born she forgets the anguish because of her joy that a child is born into the world.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span><span class="red">So with you: Now is your time of grief, but I will see you again and you will rejoice, and no one will take away your joy.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span><span class="red">In that day you will no longer ask me anything. Very truly I tell you, my Father will give you whatever you ask in my name.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span><span class="red">Until now you have not asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive, and your joy will be complete.</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;Though I have been speaking figuratively, a time is coming when I will no longer use this kind of language but will tell you plainly about my Father.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span><span class="red">In that day you will ask in my name. I am not saying that I will ask the Father on your behalf.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span><span class="red">No, the Father himself loves you because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span><span class="red">I came from the Father and entered the world; now I am leaving the world and going back to the Father.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Then Jesus&#8217; disciples said, &#8220;Now you are speaking clearly and without figures of speech. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Now we can see that you know all things and that you do not even need to have anyone ask you questions. This makes us believe that you came from God.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;Do you now believe?&#8221;</span> Jesus replied. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;A time is coming and in fact has come when you will be scattered, each to your own home. You will leave me all alone. Yet I am not alone, for my Father is with me.</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace.
