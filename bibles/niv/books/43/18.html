On the other side there was a garden, and he and his disciples went into it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Now Judas, who betrayed him, knew the place, because Jesus had often met there with his disciples. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So Judas came to the garden, guiding a detachment of soldiers and some officials from the chief priests and the Pharisees. They were carrying torches, lanterns and weapons.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Jesus, knowing all that was going to happen to him, went out and asked them, <span class="red">&#8220;Who is it you want?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8220;Jesus of Nazareth,&#8221; they replied.</p><p class="reg"><span class="red">&#8220;I am he,&#8221;</span> Jesus said. (And Judas the traitor was standing there with them.) 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>When Jesus said, <span class="red">&#8220;I am he,&#8221;</span> they drew back and fell to the ground.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Again he asked them, <span class="red">&#8220;Who is it you want?&#8221;</span></p><p class="reg">&#8220;Jesus of Nazareth,&#8221; they said.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Jesus answered, <span class="red">&#8220;I told you that I am he. If you are looking for me, then let these men go.&#8221;</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>This happened so that the words he had spoken would be fulfilled: <span class="red">&#8220;I have not lost one of those you gave me.&#8221;

</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest&#8217;s servant, cutting off his right ear. (The servant&#8217;s name was Malchus.)</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Jesus commanded Peter, <span class="red">&#8220;Put your sword away! Shall I not drink the cup the Father has given me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then the detachment of soldiers with its commander and the Jewish officials arrested Jesus. They bound him 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>and brought him first to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jewish leaders that it would be good if one man died for the people.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Peter&#8217;s First Denial</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus. Because this disciple was known to the high priest, he went with Jesus into the high priest&#8217;s courtyard, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>but Peter had to wait outside at the door. The other disciple, who was known to the high priest, came back, spoke to the servant girl on duty there and brought Peter in.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>&#8220;You aren&#8217;t one of this man&#8217;s disciples too, are you?&#8221; she asked Peter.</p><p class="reg">He replied, &#8220;I am not.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>It was cold, and the servants and officials stood around a fire they had made to keep warm. Peter also was standing with them, warming himself.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">The High Priest Questions Jesus</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Meanwhile, the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;I have spoken openly to the world,&#8221;</span> Jesus replied. <span class="red">&#8220;I always taught in synagogues or at the temple, where all the Jews come together. I said nothing in secret.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span><span class="red">Why question me? Ask those who heard me. Surely they know what I said.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>When Jesus said this, one of the officials nearby slapped him in the face. &#8220;Is this the way you answer the high priest?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;If I said something wrong,&#8221;</span> Jesus replied, <span class="red">&#8220;testify as to what is wrong. But if I spoke the truth, why did you strike me?&#8221;</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Peter&#8217;s Second and Third Denials</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Meanwhile, Simon Peter was still standing there warming himself. So they asked him, &#8220;You aren&#8217;t one of his disciples too, are you?&#8221;</p><p class="reg">He denied it, saying, &#8220;I am not.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>One of the high priest&#8217;s servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, challenged him, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t I see you with him in the garden?&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Again Peter denied it, and at that moment a rooster began to crow.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Jesus Before Pilate</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then the Jewish leaders took Jesus from Caiaphas to the palace of the Roman governor. By now it was early morning, and to avoid ceremonial uncleanness they did not enter the palace, because they wanted to be able to eat the Passover. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>So Pilate came out to them and asked, &#8220;What charges are you bringing against this man?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>&#8220;If he were not a criminal,&#8221; they replied, &#8220;we would not have handed him over to you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Pilate said, &#8220;Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;But we have no right to execute anyone,&#8221; they objected. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>This took place to fulfill what Jesus had said about the kind of death he was going to die.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Pilate then went back inside the palace, summoned Jesus and asked him, &#8220;Are you the king of the Jews?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;Is that your own idea,&#8221;</span> Jesus asked, <span class="red">&#8220;or did others talk to you about me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>&#8220;Am I a Jew?&#8221; Pilate replied. &#8220;Your own people and chief priests handed you over to me. What is it you have done?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Jesus said, <span class="red">&#8220;My kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jewish leaders. But now my kingdom is from another place.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>&#8220;You are a king, then!&#8221; said Pilate.</p><p class="reg">Jesus answered, <span class="red">&#8220;You say that I am a king. In fact, the reason I was born and came into the world is to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>&#8220;What is truth?&#8221; retorted Pilate. With this he went out again to the Jews gathered there and said, &#8220;I find no basis for a charge against him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>But it is your custom for me to release to you one prisoner at the time of the Passover. Do you want me to release &#8216;the king of the Jews&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>They shouted back, &#8220;No, not him! Give us Barabbas!&#8221; Now Barabbas had taken part in an uprising.</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><A name="footnotes"></a><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotebot">John 6:39</span><br><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
