Jesus knew that the hour had come for him to leave this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>The evening meal was in progress, and the devil had already prompted Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, to betray Jesus. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Jesus knew that the Father had put all things under his power, and that he had come from God and was returning to God; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>so he got up from the meal, took off his outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around his waist. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples&#8217; feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, &#8220;Lord, are you going to wash my feet?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Jesus replied, <span class="red">&#8220;You do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will understand.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Peter, &#8220;you shall never wash my feet.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">Jesus answered, <span class="red">&#8220;Unless I wash you, you have no part with me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;Then, Lord,&#8221; Simon Peter replied, &#8220;not just my feet but my hands and my head as well!&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Jesus answered, <span class="red">&#8220;Those who have had a bath need only to wash their feet; their whole body is clean. And you are clean, though not every one of you.&#8221;</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For he knew who was going to betray him, and that was why he said not every one was clean.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>When he had finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and returned to his place. <span class="red">&#8220;Do you understand what I have done for you?&#8221;</span> he asked them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;You call me &#8216;Teacher&#8217; and &#8216;Lord,&#8217; and rightly so, for that is what I am.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span><span class="red">Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another&#8217;s feet.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span><span class="red">I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span><span class="red">Very truly I tell you, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span><span class="red">Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.</span></p>
