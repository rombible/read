<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek Tiberias">a</a></sup></span>
 It happened this way: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Simon Peter, Thomas (also known as Didymus
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Thomas (Aramaic) and Didymus (Greek) both mean twin.">b</a></sup></span>
), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples were together. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8220;I&#8217;m going out to fish,&#8221; Simon Peter told them, and they said, &#8220;We&#8217;ll go with you.&#8221; So they went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>He called out to them, <span class="red">&#8220;Friends, haven&#8217;t you any fish?&#8221;</span></p><p class="reg">&#8220;No,&#8221; they answered.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>He said, <span class="red">&#8220;Throw your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some.&#8221;</span> When they did, they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fish.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, &#8220;It is the Lord!&#8221; As soon as Simon Peter heard him say, &#8220;It is the Lord,&#8221; he wrapped his outer garment around him (for he had taken it off) and jumped into the water. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>The other disciples followed in the boat, towing the net full of fish, for they were not far from shore, about a hundred yards.
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or about 90 meters">c</a></sup></span>
 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>When they landed, they saw a fire of burning coals there with fish on it, and some bread.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Jesus said to them, <span class="red">&#8220;Bring some of the fish you have just caught.&#8221;</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So Simon Peter climbed back into the boat and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish, 153, but even with so many the net was not torn. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Jesus said to them, <span class="red">&#8220;Come and have breakfast.&#8221;</span> None of the disciples dared ask him, &#8220;Who are you?&#8221; They knew it was the Lord. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Jesus came, took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Jesus Reinstates Peter</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, <span class="red">&#8220;Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?&#8221;</span></p><p class="reg">&#8220;Yes, Lord,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you know that I love you.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">Jesus said, <span class="red">&#8220;Feed my lambs.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Again Jesus said, <span class="red">&#8220;Simon son of John, do you love me?&#8221;</span></p><p class="reg">He answered, &#8220;Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">Jesus said, <span class="red">&#8220;Take care of my sheep.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>The third time he said to him, <span class="red">&#8220;Simon son of John, do you love me?&#8221;</span></p><p class="reg">Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, <span class="red">&#8220;Do you love me?&#8221;</span> He said, &#8220;Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">Jesus said, <span class="red">&#8220;Feed my sheep.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span><span class="red">Very truly I tell you, when you were younger you dressed yourself and went where you wanted; but when you are old you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go.&#8221;</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God. Then he said to him, <span class="red">&#8220;Follow me!&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Peter turned and saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved was following them. (This was the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper and had said, &#8220;Lord, who is going to betray you?&#8221;) 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>When Peter saw him, he asked, &#8220;Lord, what about him?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Jesus answered, <span class="red">&#8220;If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you? You must follow me.&#8221;</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Because of this, the rumor spread among the believers that this disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say that he would not die; he only said, <span class="red">&#8220;If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them down. We know that his testimony is true.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written.</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><A name="footnotes"></a><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotebot">Greek <i>Tiberias</i></span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotebot"><i>Thomas</i> (Aramaic) and <i>Didymus</i> (Greek) both mean <i>twin</i>.</span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">c</span> <span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotebot">Or about 90 meters</span><br><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
