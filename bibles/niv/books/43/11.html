<div class="chap"><p class="sectionhead">The Death of Lazarus</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Now a man named Lazarus was sick. He was from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>(This Mary, whose brother Lazarus now lay sick, was the same one who poured perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair.) 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So the sisters sent word to Jesus, &#8220;Lord, the one you love is sick.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>When he heard this, Jesus said, <span class="red">&#8220;This sickness will not end in death. No, it is for God&#8217;s glory so that God&#8217;s Son may be glorified through it.&#8221;</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was two more days, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and then he said to his disciples, <span class="red">&#8220;Let us go back to Judea.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8220;But Rabbi,&#8221; they said, &#8220;a short while ago the Jews there tried to stone you, and yet you are going back?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Jesus answered, <span class="red">&#8220;Are there not twelve hours of daylight? Anyone who walks in the daytime will not stumble, for they see by this world&#8217;s light.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><span class="red">It is when a person walks at night that they stumble, for they have no light.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>After he had said this, he went on to tell them, <span class="red">&#8220;Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going there to wake him up.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>His disciples replied, &#8220;Lord, if he sleeps, he will get better.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Jesus had been speaking of his death, but his disciples thought he meant natural sleep.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So then he told them plainly, <span class="red">&#8220;Lazarus is dead,</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span><span class="red">and for your sake I am glad I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then Thomas (also known as Didymus
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Thomas (Aramaic) and Didymus (Greek) both mean twin.">a</a></sup></span>
) said to the rest of the disciples, &#8220;Let us also go, that we may die with him.&#8221;</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Jesus Comforts the Sisters of Lazarus</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>On his arrival, Jesus found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Now Bethany was less than two miles
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or about 3 kilometers">b</a></sup></span>
 from Jerusalem, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>and many Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them in the loss of their brother. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him, but Mary stayed at home.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>&#8220;Lord,&#8221; Martha said to Jesus, &#8220;if you had been here, my brother would not have died. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But I know that even now God will give you whatever you ask.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Jesus said to her, <span class="red">&#8220;Your brother will rise again.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Martha answered, &#8220;I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Jesus said to her, <span class="red">&#8220;I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die;</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span><span class="red">and whoever lives by believing in me will never die. Do you believe this?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>&#8220;Yes, Lord,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;I believe that you are the Messiah, the Son of God, who is to come into the world.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>After she had said this, she went back and called her sister Mary aside. &#8220;The Teacher is here,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and is asking for you.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>When Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>When the Jews who had been with Mary in the house, comforting her, noticed how quickly she got up and went out, they followed her, supposing she was going to the tomb to mourn there.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>When Mary reached the place where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet and said, &#8220;Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come along with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;Where have you laid him?&#8221;</span> he asked.</p><p class="reg">&#8220;Come and see, Lord,&#8221; they replied.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Jesus wept.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Then the Jews said, &#8220;See how he loved him!&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>But some of them said, &#8220;Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?&#8221;</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Jesus Raises Lazarus From the Dead</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>Jesus, once more deeply moved, came to the tomb. It was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;Take away the stone,&#8221;</span> he said.</p><p class="reg">&#8220;But, Lord,&#8221; said Martha, the sister of the dead man, &#8220;by this time there is a bad odor, for he has been there four days.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>Then Jesus said, <span class="red">&#8220;Did I not tell you that if you believe, you will see the glory of God?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>So they took away the stone. Then Jesus looked up and said, <span class="red">&#8220;Father, I thank you that you have heard me.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span><span class="red">I knew that you always hear me, but I said this for the benefit of the people standing here, that they may believe that you sent me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>When he had said this, Jesus called in a loud voice, <span class="red">&#8220;Lazarus, come out!&#8221;</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped with strips of linen, and a cloth around his face.</p><p class="reg">Jesus said to them, <span class="red">&#8220;Take off the grave clothes and let him go.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="sectionhead">The Plot to Kill Jesus</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>Therefore many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary, and had seen what Jesus did, believed in him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span>But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-47.htm"><b>47</b></a></span>Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin.</p><p class="reg">&#8220;What are we accomplishing?&#8221; they asked. &#8220;Here is this man performing many signs. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-48.htm"><b>48</b></a></span>If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and then the Romans will come and take away both our temple and our nation.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-49.htm"><b>49</b></a></span>Then one of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, spoke up, &#8220;You know nothing at all! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-50.htm"><b>50</b></a></span>You do not realize that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-51.htm"><b>51</b></a></span>He did not say this on his own, but as high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-52.htm"><b>52</b></a></span>and not only for that nation but also for the scattered children of God, to bring them together and make them one. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-53.htm"><b>53</b></a></span>So from that day on they plotted to take his life.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-54.htm"><b>54</b></a></span>Therefore Jesus no longer moved about publicly among the people of Judea. Instead he withdrew to a region near the wilderness, to a village called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-55.htm"><b>55</b></a></span>When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, many went up from the country to Jerusalem for their ceremonial cleansing before the Passover. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-56.htm"><b>56</b></a></span>They kept looking for Jesus, and as they stood in the temple courts they asked one another, &#8220;What do you think? Isn&#8217;t he coming to the festival at all?&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-57.htm"><b>57</b></a></span>But the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that anyone who found out where Jesus was should report it so that they might arrest him.</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><A name="footnotes"></a><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotebot"><i>Thomas</i> (Aramaic) and <i>Didymus</i> (Greek) both mean <i>twin</i>.</span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">18</span> <span class="footnotebot">Or about 3 kilometers</span><br><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
