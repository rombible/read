<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>The Pharisees challenged him, &#8220;Here you are, appearing as your own witness; your testimony is not valid.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Jesus answered, <span class="red">&#8220;Even if I testify on my own behalf, my testimony is valid, for I know where I came from and where I am going.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then they asked him, &#8220;Where is your father?&#8221;</p><p class="reg"><span class="red">&#8220;You do not know me or my Father,&#8221;</span> Jesus replied. <span class="red">&#8220;If you knew me, you would know my Father also.&#8221;</span>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>This made the Jews ask, &#8220;Will he kill himself? Is that why he says, <span class="red">&#8216;Where I go, you cannot come&#8217;</span>?&#8221;</p>
