<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool, which in Aramaic is called Bethesda
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts Bethzatha; other manuscripts Bethsaida">a</a></sup></span>
 and which is surrounded by five covered colonnades. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Here a great number of disabled people used to lie&#8212;the blind, the lame, the paralyzed.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>One who was there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>When Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition for a long time, he asked him, <span class="red">&#8220;Do you want to get well?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8220;Sir,&#8221; the invalid replied, &#8220;I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then Jesus said to him, <span class="red">&#8220;Get up! Pick up your mat and walk.&#8221;</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>At once the man was cured; he picked up his mat and walked.</p><p class="reg">The day on which this took place was a Sabbath, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and so the Jewish leaders said to the man who had been healed, &#8220;It is the Sabbath; the law forbids you to carry your mat.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But he replied, &#8220;The man who made me well said to me, <span class="red">&#8216;Pick up your mat and walk.&#8217;</span>&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So they asked him, &#8220;Who is this fellow who told you to pick it up and walk?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>The man who was healed had no idea who it was, for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Later Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, <span class="red">&#8220;See, you are well again. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you.&#8221;</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>The man went away and told the Jewish leaders that it was Jesus who had made him well.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">The Authority of the Son</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So, because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jewish leaders began to persecute him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>In his defense Jesus said to them, <span class="red">&#8220;My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I too am working.&#8221;</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>For this reason they tried all the more to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Jesus gave them this answer: <span class="red">&#8220;Very truly I tell you, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span><span class="red">For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does. Yes, and he will show him even greater works than these, so that you will be amazed.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span><span class="red">For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span><span class="red">Moreover, the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son,</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span><span class="red">that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father, who sent him.</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;Very truly I tell you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be judged but has crossed over from death to life.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span><span class="red">Very truly I tell you, a time is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear will live.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span><span class="red">For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span><span class="red">And he has given him authority to judge because he is the Son of Man.</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;Do not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span><span class="red">and come out&#8212;those who have done what is good will rise to live, and those who have done what is evil will rise to be condemned.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span><span class="red">By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me.</span></p>
