<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Here a dinner was given in Jesus&#8217; honor. Martha served, while Lazarus was among those reclining at the table with him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then Mary took about a pint
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or about 0.5 liter">a</a></sup></span>
 of pure nard, an expensive perfume; she poured it on Jesus&#8217; feet and wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was later to betray him, objected, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8220;Why wasn&#8217;t this perfume sold and the money given to the poor? It was worth a year&#8217;s wages.
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek three hundred denarii">b</a></sup></span>
&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>He did not say this because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief; as keeper of the money bag, he used to help himself to what was put into it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;Leave her alone,&#8221;</span> Jesus replied. <span class="red">&#8220;It was intended that she should save this perfume for the day of my burial.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><span class="red">You will always have the poor among you,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="See Deut. 15:11.">c</a></sup></span>
 but you will not always have me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Meanwhile a large crowd of Jews found out that Jesus was there and came, not only because of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus as well, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>for on account of him many of the Jews were going over to Jesus and believing in him.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Jesus Comes to Jerusalem as King</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>The next day the great crowd that had come for the festival heard that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>They took palm branches and went out to meet him, shouting,</p><div class="stanza"><p class="line1">&#8220;Hosanna!

<p class="pcontinued"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it, as it is written:</p>

</p></div>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>At first his disciples did not understand all this. Only after Jesus was glorified did they realize that these things had been written about him and that these things had been done to him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Now the crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to spread the word. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Many people, because they had heard that he had performed this sign, went out to meet him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>So the Pharisees said to one another, &#8220;See, this is getting us nowhere. Look how the whole world has gone after him!&#8221;</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Jesus Predicts His Death</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the festival.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Philip went to tell Andrew; Andrew and Philip in turn told Jesus.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Jesus replied, <span class="red">&#8220;The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.</span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>He said this to show the kind of death he was going to die.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>The crowd spoke up, &#8220;We have heard from the Law that the Messiah will remain forever, so how can you say, <span class="red">&#8216;The Son of Man must be lifted up&#8217;</span>?

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Then Jesus told them, <span class="red">&#8220;You are going to have the light just a little while longer.

</p></div>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>For this reason they could not believe, because, as Isaiah says elsewhere:</p>

</p></div>
<p class="pcontinued"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus&#8217; glory and spoke about him.</p>
