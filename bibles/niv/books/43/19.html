<div class="chap"><p class="sectionhead">Jesus Sentenced to Be Crucified</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>The soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They clothed him in a purple robe 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and went up to him again and again, saying, &#8220;Hail, king of the Jews!&#8221; And they slapped him in the face.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Once more Pilate came out and said to the Jews gathered there, &#8220;Look, I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against him.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>When Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, Pilate said to them, &#8220;Here is the man!&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>As soon as the chief priests and their officials saw him, they shouted, &#8220;Crucify! Crucify!&#8221;</p><p class="reg">But Pilate answered, &#8220;You take him and crucify him. As for me, I find no basis for a charge against him.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>The Jewish leaders insisted, &#8220;We have a law, and according to that law he must die, because he claimed to be the Son of God.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>When Pilate heard this, he was even more afraid, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and he went back inside the palace. &#8220;Where do you come from?&#8221; he asked Jesus, but Jesus gave him no answer. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8220;Do you refuse to speak to me?&#8221; Pilate said. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you realize I have power either to free you or to crucify you?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Jesus answered, <span class="red">&#8220;You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>From then on, Pilate tried to set Jesus free, but the Jewish leaders kept shouting, &#8220;If you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge&#8217;s seat at a place known as the Stone Pavement (which in Aramaic is Gabbatha). 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>It was the day of Preparation of the Passover; it was about noon.</p><p class="reg">&#8220;Here is your king,&#8221; Pilate said to the Jews.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But they shouted, &#8220;Take him away! Take him away! Crucify him!&#8221;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;Shall I crucify your king?&#8221; Pilate asked.</p><p class="reg">&#8220;We have no king but Caesar,&#8221; the chief priests answered.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Finally Pilate handed him over to them to be crucified.</p><p class="sectionhead">The Crucifixion of Jesus</p><p class="reg">So the soldiers took charge of Jesus. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Carrying his own cross, he went out to the place of the Skull (which in Aramaic is called Golgotha). 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>There they crucified him, and with him two others&#8212;one on each side and Jesus in the middle.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Pilate had a notice prepared and fastened to the cross. It read: <span class="inscription">jesus of nazareth</span>, <span class="inscription">the king of the jews</span>. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Many of the Jews read this sign, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and the sign was written in Aramaic, Latin and Greek. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>The chief priests of the Jews protested to Pilate, &#8220;Do not write &#8216;The King of the Jews,&#8217; but that this man claimed to be king of the Jews.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Pilate answered, &#8220;What I have written, I have written.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>When the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothes, dividing them into four shares, one for each of them, with the undergarment remaining. This garment was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>&#8220;Let&#8217;s not tear it,&#8221; they said to one another. &#8220;Let&#8217;s decide by lot who will get it.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">This happened that the scripture might be fulfilled that said,</p><div class="stanza"><p class="line1">&#8220;They divided my clothes among them</p><p class="line2">and cast lots for my garment.&#8221;

</p></div><p class="pcontinued">So this is what the soldiers did.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mother&#8217;s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>When Jesus saw his mother there, and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to her, <span class="red">&#8220;Woman,

 here is your son,&#8221;</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>and to the disciple, <span class="red">&#8220;Here is your mother.&#8221;</span> From that time on, this disciple took her into his home.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">The Death of Jesus</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Later, knowing that everything had now been finished, and so that Scripture would be fulfilled, Jesus said, <span class="red">&#8220;I am thirsty.&#8221;</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>A jar of wine vinegar was there, so they soaked a sponge in it, put the sponge on a stalk of the hyssop plant, and lifted it to Jesus&#8217; lips. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>When he had received the drink, Jesus said, <span class="red">&#8220;It is finished.&#8221;</span> With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Now it was the day of Preparation, and the next day was to be a special Sabbath. Because the Jewish leaders did not want the bodies left on the crosses during the Sabbath, they asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken down. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus, and then those of the other. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>But when they came to Jesus and found that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Instead, one of the soldiers pierced Jesus&#8217; side with a spear, bringing a sudden flow of blood and water. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>The man who saw it has given testimony, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, and he testifies so that you also may believe. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>These things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled: &#8220;Not one of his bones will be broken,&#8221;

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>and, as another scripture says, &#8220;They will look on the one they have pierced.&#8221;

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>He was accompanied by Nicodemus, the man who earlier had visited Jesus at night. Nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds.
