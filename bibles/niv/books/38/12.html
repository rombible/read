<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;I am going to make Jerusalem a cup that sends all the surrounding peoples reeling. Judah will be besieged as well as Jerusalem. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>On that day, when all the nations of the earth are gathered against her, I will make Jerusalem an immovable rock for all the nations. All who try to move it will injure themselves. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>On that day I will strike every horse with panic and its rider with madness,&#8221; declares the <span class="name">Lord</span>. &#8220;I will keep a watchful eye over Judah, but I will blind all the horses of the nations. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts, &#8216;The people of Jerusalem are strong, because the <span class="name">Lord</span> Almighty is their God.&#8217;</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8220;The <span class="name">Lord</span> will save the dwellings of Judah first, so that the honor of the house of David and of Jerusalem&#8217;s inhabitants may not be greater than that of Judah. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>On that day the <span class="name">Lord</span> will shield those who live in Jerusalem, so that the feeblest among them will be like David, and the house of David will be like God, like the angel of the <span class="name">Lord</span> going before them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>On that day I will set out to destroy all the nations that attack Jerusalem.</p>
