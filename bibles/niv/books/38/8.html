<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> Almighty says: &#8220;I am very jealous for Zion; I am burning with jealousy for her.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> says: &#8220;I will return to Zion and dwell in Jerusalem.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Before that time there were no wages for people or hire for animals. No one could go about their business safely because of their enemies, since I had turned everyone against their neighbor.
