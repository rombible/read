<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;The <span class="name">Lord</span> was very angry with your ancestors. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Therefore tell the people: This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> Almighty says: &#8216;Return to me,&#8217; declares the <span class="name">Lord</span> Almighty, &#8216;and I will return to you,&#8217; says the <span class="name">Lord</span> Almighty. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Do not be like your ancestors, to whom the earlier prophets proclaimed: This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> Almighty says: &#8216;Turn from your evil ways and your evil practices.&#8217; But they would not listen or pay attention to me, declares the <span class="name">Lord</span>. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Where are your ancestors now? And the prophets, do they live forever? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But did not my words and my decrees, which I commanded my servants the prophets, overtake your ancestors?</p><p class="reg">&#8220;Then they repented and said, &#8216;The <span class="name">Lord</span> Almighty has done to us what our ways and practices deserve, just as he determined to do.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="sectionhead">The Man Among the Myrtle Trees</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, the month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the <span class="name">Lord</span> came to the prophet Zechariah son of Berekiah, the son of Iddo.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>During the night I had a vision, and there before me was a man mounted on a red horse. He was standing among the myrtle trees in a ravine. Behind him were red, brown and white horses.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>I asked, &#8220;What are these, my lord?&#8221;</p><p class="reg">The angel who was talking with me answered, &#8220;I will show you what they are.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then the man standing among the myrtle trees explained, &#8220;They are the ones the <span class="name">Lord</span> has sent to go throughout the earth.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And they reported to the angel of the <span class="name">Lord</span> who was standing among the myrtle trees, &#8220;We have gone throughout the earth and found the whole world at rest and in peace.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then the angel of the <span class="name">Lord</span> said, &#8220;<span class="name">Lord</span> Almighty, how long will you withhold mercy from Jerusalem and from the towns of Judah, which you have been angry with these seventy years?&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So the <span class="name">Lord</span> spoke kind and comforting words to the angel who talked with me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then the angel who was speaking to me said, &#8220;Proclaim this word: This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> Almighty says: &#8216;I am very jealous for Jerusalem and Zion, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and I am very angry with the nations that feel secure. I was only a little angry, but they went too far with the punishment.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>&#8220;Therefore this is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> says: &#8216;I will return to Jerusalem with mercy, and there my house will be rebuilt.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>&#8220;Proclaim further: This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> Almighty says: &#8216;My towns will again overflow with prosperity, and the <span class="name">Lord</span> will again comfort Zion and choose Jerusalem.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Four Horns and Four Craftsmen</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then I looked up, and there before me were four horns. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>I asked the angel who was speaking to me, &#8220;What are these?&#8221;</p><p class="reg">He answered me, &#8220;These are the horns that scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then the <span class="name">Lord</span> showed me four craftsmen.
