<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_john/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>because of the truth, which lives in us and will be with us forever:</p>
<p class="opening"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_john/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Father&#8217;s Son, will be with us in truth and love.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_john/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>It has given me great joy to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as the Father commanded us. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_john/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And now, dear lady, I am not writing you a new command but one we have had from the beginning. I ask that we love one another. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_john/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And this is love: that we walk in obedience to his commands. As you have heard from the beginning, his command is that you walk in love.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_john/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>I say this because many deceivers, who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh, have gone out into the world. Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist.
