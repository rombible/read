Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Mark my words! I, Paul, tell you that if you let yourselves be circumcised, Christ will be of no value to you at all. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Again I declare to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obligated to obey the whole law. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>You who are trying to be justified by the law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For through the Spirit we eagerly await by faith the righteousness for which we hope. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value. The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>You were running a good race. Who cut in on you to keep you from obeying the truth? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>That kind of persuasion does not come from the one who calls you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;A little yeast works through the whole batch of dough.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>I am confident in the Lord that you will take no other view. The one who is throwing you into confusion, whoever that may be, will have to pay the penalty. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Brothers and sisters, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been abolished. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>As for those agitators, I wish they would go the whole way and emasculate themselves!</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Life by the Spirit</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/5-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>You, my brothers and sisters, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/5-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
