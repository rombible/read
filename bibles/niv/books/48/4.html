<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>The heir is subject to guardians and trustees until the time set by his father. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So also, when we were underage, we were in slavery under the elemental spiritual forces

 of the world. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But when the set time had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>to redeem those under the law, that we might receive adoption to sonship.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Because you are his sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the Spirit who calls out, <span class="foreign">&#8220;Abba</span>,

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So you are no longer a slave, but God&#8217;s child; and since you are his child, God has made you also an heir.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>You are observing special days and months and seasons and years! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>I fear for you, that somehow I have wasted my efforts on you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>I plead with you, brothers and sisters, become like me, for I became like you. You did me no wrong. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>As you know, it was because of an illness that I first preached the gospel to you, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>and even though my illness was a trial to you, you did not treat me with contempt or scorn. Instead, you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God, as if I were Christ Jesus himself. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Where, then, is your blessing of me now? I can testify that, if you could have done so, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>It is fine to be zealous, provided the purpose is good, and to be so always, not just when I am with you.

<p class="sectionhead">Hagar and Sarah</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Tell me, you who want to be under the law, are you not aware of what the law says? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>His son by the slave woman was born according to the flesh, but his son by the free woman was born as the result of a divine promise.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>These things are being taken figuratively: The women represent two covenants. One covenant is from Mount Sinai and bears children who are to be slaves: This is Hagar. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Now Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present city of Jerusalem, because she is in slavery with her children. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>But the Jerusalem that is above is free, and she is our mother. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>For it is written:</p><div class="stanza"><p class="line1">&#8220;Be glad, barren woman,</p><p class="line2">you who never bore a child;</p><p class="line1">shout for joy and cry aloud,</p><p class="line2">you who were never in labor;</p><p class="line1">because more are the children of the desolate woman</p><p class="line2">than of her who has a husband.&#8221;

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Now you, brothers and sisters, like Isaac, are children of promise. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>At that time the son born according to the flesh persecuted the son born by the power of the Spirit. It is the same now.
