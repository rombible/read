But watch yourselves, or you also may be tempted. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Carry each other&#8217;s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>If anyone thinks they are something when they are not, they deceive themselves. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Each one should test their own actions. Then they can take pride in themselves alone, without comparing themselves to someone else, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>for each one should carry their own load. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Nevertheless, the one who receives instruction in the word should share all good things with their instructor.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Whoever sows to please their flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; whoever sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Those who want to impress people by means of the flesh are trying to compel you to be circumcised. The only reason they do this is to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Christ. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Not even those who are circumcised keep the law, yet they want you to be circumcised that they may boast about your circumcision in the flesh. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/6-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything; what counts is the new creation.
