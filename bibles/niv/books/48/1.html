 with me,</p><p class="opening">To the churches in Galatia:</p>
<p class="opening"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">No Other Gospel</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you to live in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel&#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>which is really no gospel at all. Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let them be under God&#8217;s curse! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>As we have already said, so now I say again: If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let them be under God&#8217;s curse!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Am I now trying to win the approval of human beings, or of God? Or am I trying to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a servant of Christ.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Paul Called by God</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that the gospel I preached is not of human origin. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For you have heard of my previous way of life in Judaism, how intensely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But when God, who set me apart from my mother&#8217;s womb and called me by his grace, was pleased 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>to reveal his Son in me so that I might preach him among the Gentiles, my immediate response was not to consult any human being. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>I did not go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before I was, but I went into Arabia. Later I returned to Damascus.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to get acquainted with Cephas
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, Peter">b</a></sup></span>
 and stayed with him fifteen days. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>I saw none of the other apostles&#8212;only James, the Lord&#8217;s brother. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>I assure you before God that what I am writing you is no lie.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then I went to Syria and Cilicia. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>I was personally unknown to the churches of Judea that are in Christ. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>They only heard the report: &#8220;The man who formerly persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy.&#8221;
