<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God&#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>having a form of godliness but denying its power. Have nothing to do with such people.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>They are the kind who worm their way into homes and gain control over gullible women, who are loaded down with sins and are swayed by all kinds of evil desires, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>always learning but never able to come to a knowledge of the truth. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so also these teachers oppose the truth. They are men of depraved minds, who, as far as the faith is concerned, are rejected. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But they will not get very far because, as in the case of those men, their folly will be clear to everyone.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>persecutions, sufferings&#8212;what kinds of things happened to me in Antioch, Iconium and Lystra, the persecutions I endured. Yet the Lord rescued me from all of them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>In fact, everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>while evildoers and impostors will go from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have become convinced of, because you know those from whom you learned it,
