<div class="chap"><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead, and in view of his appearing and his kingdom, I give you this charge: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Preach the word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage&#8212;with great patience and careful instruction. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For the time will come when people will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But you, keep your head in all situations, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, discharge all the duties of your ministry.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>For I am already being poured out like a drink offering, and the time for my departure is near. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day&#8212;and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Personal Remarks</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Do your best to come to me quickly, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>for Demas, because he loved this world, has deserted me and has gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, because he is helpful to me in my ministry. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>I sent Tychicus to Ephesus. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>When you come, bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas, and my scrolls, especially the parchments.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Alexander the metalworker did me a great deal of harm. The Lord will repay him for what he has done. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>You too should be on your guard against him, because he strongly opposed our message.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>At my first defense, no one came to my support, but everyone deserted me. May it not be held against them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But the Lord stood at my side and gave me strength, so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it. And I was delivered from the lion&#8217;s mouth. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>The Lord will rescue me from every evil attack and will bring me safely to his heavenly kingdom. To him be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
