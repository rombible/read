<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And the things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable people who will also be qualified to teach others. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Join with me in suffering, like a good soldier of Christ Jesus. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>No one serving as a soldier gets entangled in civilian affairs, but rather tries to please his commanding officer. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Similarly, anyone who competes as an athlete does not receive the victor&#8217;s crown except by competing according to the rules. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>The hardworking farmer should be the first to receive a share of the crops. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Reflect on what I am saying, for the Lord will give you insight into all this.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, descended from David. This is my gospel, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>for which I am suffering even to the point of being chained like a criminal. But God&#8217;s word is not chained. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.</p>

<p class="sectionhead">Dealing With False Teachers</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Keep reminding God&#8217;s people of these things. Warn them before God against quarreling about words; it is of no value, and only ruins those who listen. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Avoid godless chatter, because those who indulge in it will become more and more ungodly. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Their teaching will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>who have departed from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already taken place, and they destroy the faith of some. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Nevertheless, God&#8217;s solid foundation stands firm, sealed with this inscription: &#8220;The Lord knows those who are his,&#8221; and, &#8220;Everyone who confesses the name of the Lord must turn away from wickedness.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>In a large house there are articles not only of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay; some are for special purposes and some for common use. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Those who cleanse themselves from the latter will be instruments for special purposes, made holy, useful to the Master and prepared to do any good work.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Flee the evil desires of youth and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Don&#8217;t have anything to do with foolish and stupid arguments, because you know they produce quarrels. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And the Lord&#8217;s servant must not be quarrelsome but must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Opponents must be gently instructed, in the hope that God will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>and that they will come to their senses and escape from the trap of the devil, who has taken them captive to do his will.</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
