<p class="opening"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>To Timothy, my dear son:</p><p class="opening">Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Thanksgiving</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>I thank God, whom I serve, as my ancestors did, with a clear conscience, as night and day I constantly remember you in my prayers. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Recalling your tears, I long to see you, so that I may be filled with joy. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>I am reminded of your sincere faith, which first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice and, I am persuaded, now lives in you also.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Appeal for Loyalty to Paul and the Gospel</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For the Spirit God gave us does not make us timid, but gives us power, love and self-discipline. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord or of me his prisoner. Rather, join with me in suffering for the gospel, by the power of God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>He has saved us and called us to a holy life&#8212;not because of anything we have done but because of his own purpose and grace. This grace was given us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>but it has now been revealed through the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who has destroyed death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And of this gospel I was appointed a herald and an apostle and a teacher. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>That is why I am suffering as I am. Yet this is no cause for shame, because I know whom I have believed, and am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him until that day.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>What you heard from me, keep as the pattern of sound teaching, with faith and love in Christ Jesus. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Guard the good deposit that was entrusted to you&#8212;guard it with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Examples of Disloyalty and Loyalty</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>You know that everyone in the province of Asia has deserted me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>May the Lord show mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>On the contrary, when he was in Rome, he searched hard for me until he found me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>May the Lord grant that he will find mercy from the Lord on that day! You know very well in how many ways he helped me in Ephesus.</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
