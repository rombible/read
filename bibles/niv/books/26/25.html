<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, set your face against the Ammonites and prophesy against them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Say to them, &#8216;Hear the word of the Sovereign <span class="name">Lord</span>. This is what the Sovereign <span class="name">Lord</span> says: Because you said &#8220;Aha!&#8221; over my sanctuary when it was desecrated and over the land of Israel when it was laid waste and over the people of Judah when they went into exile, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>therefore I am going to give you to the people of the East as a possession. They will set up their camps and pitch their tents among you; they will eat your fruit and drink your milk.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>therefore I will stretch out my hand against you and give you as plunder to the nations.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>therefore I will expose the flank of Moab, beginning at its frontier towns&#8212;Beth Jeshimoth, Baal Meon and Kiriathaim&#8212;the glory of that land.
