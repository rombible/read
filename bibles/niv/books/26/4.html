<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then lay siege to it: Erect siege works against it, build a ramp up to it, set up camps against it and put battering rams around it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then take an iron pan, place it as an iron wall between you and the city and turn your face toward it. It will be under siege, and you shall besiege it. This will be a sign to the people of Israel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8220;Then lie on your left side and put the sin of the people of Israel upon yourself.

 You are to bear their sin for the number of days you lie on your side. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>I have assigned you the same number of days as the years of their sin. So for 390 days you will bear the sin of the people of Israel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>&#8220;After you have finished this, lie down again, this time on your right side, and bear the sin of the people of Judah. I have assigned you 40 days, a day for each year. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Turn your face toward the siege of Jerusalem and with bared arm prophesy against her. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>I will tie you up with ropes so that you cannot turn from one side to the other until you have finished the days of your siege.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;Take wheat and barley, beans and lentils, millet and spelt; put them in a storage jar and use them to make bread for yourself. You are to eat it during the 390 days you lie on your side. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Weigh out twenty shekels
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, about 8 ounces or about 230 grams">b</a></sup></span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Eat the food as you would a loaf of barley bread; bake it in the sight of the people, using human excrement for fuel.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> said, &#8220;In this way the people of Israel will eat defiled food among the nations where I will drive them.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then I said, &#8220;Not so, Sovereign <span class="name">Lord</span>! I have never defiled myself. From my youth until now I have never eaten anything found dead or torn by wild animals. No impure meat has ever entered my mouth.&#8221;</p>
