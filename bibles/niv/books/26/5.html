Take a third and strike it with the sword all around the city. And scatter a third to the wind. For I will pursue them with drawn sword. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But take a few hairs and tuck them away in the folds of your garment. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Again, take a few of these and throw them into the fire and burn them up. A fire will spread from there to all Israel.</p>
