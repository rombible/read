<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>On the fifth of the month&#8212;it was the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin&#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>the word of the <span class="name">Lord</span> came to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, by the Kebar River in the land of the Babylonians.
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or Chaldeans">a</a></sup></span>
 There the hand of the <span class="name">Lord</span> was on him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>I looked, and I saw a windstorm coming out of the north&#8212;an immense cloud with flashing lightning and surrounded by brilliant light. The center of the fire looked like glowing metal, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and in the fire was what looked like four living creatures. In appearance their form was human, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>but each of them had four faces and four wings. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Their legs were straight; their feet were like those of a calf and gleamed like burnished bronze. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Under their wings on their four sides they had human hands. All four of them had faces and wings, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and the wings of one touched the wings of another. Each one went straight ahead; they did not turn as they moved.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Their faces looked like this: Each of the four had the face of a human being, and on the right side each had the face of a lion, and on the left the face of an ox; each also had the face of an eagle. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Such were their faces. They each had two wings spreading out upward, each wing touching that of the creature on either side; and each had two other wings covering its body. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Each one went straight ahead. Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, without turning as they went. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>The appearance of the living creatures was like burning coals of fire or like torches. Fire moved back and forth among the creatures; it was bright, and lightning flashed out of it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>The creatures sped back and forth like flashes of lightning.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>As I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the ground beside each creature with its four faces. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>This was the appearance and structure of the wheels: They sparkled like topaz, and all four looked alike. Each appeared to be made like a wheel intersecting a wheel. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>As they moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the creatures faced; the wheels did not change direction as the creatures went. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Their rims were high and awesome, and all four rims were full of eyes all around.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>When the living creatures moved, the wheels beside them moved; and when the living creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, and the wheels would rise along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>When the creatures moved, they also moved; when the creatures stood still, they also stood still; and when the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels rose along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Spread out above the heads of the living creatures was what looked something like a vault, sparkling like crystal, and awesome. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Under the vault their wings were stretched out one toward the other, and each had two wings covering its body. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>When the creatures moved, I heard the sound of their wings, like the roar of rushing waters, like the voice of the Almighty,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew Shaddai">b</a></sup></span>
 like the tumult of an army. When they stood still, they lowered their wings.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then there came a voice from above the vault over their heads as they stood with lowered wings. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Above the vault over their heads was what looked like a throne of lapis lazuli, and high above on the throne was a figure like that of a man. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>I saw that from what appeared to be his waist up he looked like glowing metal, as if full of fire, and that from there down he looked like fire; and brilliant light surrounded him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day, so was the radiance around him.</p><p class="reg">This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the <span class="name">Lord</span>. When I saw it, I fell facedown, and I heard the voice of one speaking.</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><A name="footnotes"></a><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotebot">Or <i>Chaldeans</i></span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">24</span> <span class="footnotebot">Hebrew <i>Shaddai</i></span><br><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
