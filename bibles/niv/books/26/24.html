<div class="chap"><p class="sectionhead">Jerusalem as a Cooking Pot</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>In the ninth year, in the tenth month on the tenth day, the word of the <span class="name">Lord</span> came to me: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, record this date, this very date, because the king of Babylon has laid siege to Jerusalem this very day. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Tell this rebellious people a parable and say to them: &#8216;This is what the Sovereign <span class="name">Lord</span> says:</p><div class="stanza"><p class="line1">&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;Put on the cooking pot; put it on</p><p class="line2">and pour water into it.</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Put into it the pieces of meat,</p><p class="line2">all the choice pieces&#8212;the leg and the shoulder.</p><p class="line1">Fill it with the best of these bones;</p>
<p class="line2"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>take the pick of the flock.</p><p class="line1">Pile wood beneath it for the bones;</p><p class="line2">bring it to a boil</p><p class="line2">and cook the bones in it.</p></div>
<p class="introduction"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;For this is what the Sovereign <span class="name">Lord</span> says:</p><div class="stanza"><p class="line1">&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;Woe to the city of bloodshed,</p><p class="line2">to the pot now encrusted,</p><p class="line2">whose deposit will not go away!</p><p class="line1">Take the meat out piece by piece</p><p class="line2">in whatever order it comes.</p></div>
<div class="stanza"><p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;For the blood she shed is in her midst:</p><p class="line2">She poured it on the bare rock;</p><p class="line1">she did not pour it on the ground,</p><p class="line2">where the dust would cover it.</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>To stir up wrath and take revenge</p><p class="line2">I put her blood on the bare rock,</p><p class="line2">so that it would not be covered.</p></div>
<p class="introduction"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;Therefore this is what the Sovereign <span class="name">Lord</span> says:</p><div class="stanza"><p class="line1">&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;Woe to the city of bloodshed!</p><p class="line2">I, too, will pile the wood high.</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So heap on the wood</p><p class="line2">and kindle the fire.</p><p class="line1">Cook the meat well,</p><p class="line2">mixing in the spices;</p><p class="line2">and let the bones be charred.</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then set the empty pot on the coals</p><p class="line2">till it becomes hot and its copper glows,</p><p class="line1">so that its impurities may be melted</p><p class="line2">and its deposit burned away.</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>It has frustrated all efforts;</p><p class="line2">its heavy deposit has not been removed,</p><p class="line2">not even by fire.</p></div>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;Now your impurity is lewdness. Because I tried to cleanse you but you would not be cleansed from your impurity, you will not be clean again until my wrath against you has subsided.</p>
<p class="pconclusion"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;I the <span class="name">Lord</span> have spoken. The time has come for me to act. I will not hold back; I will not have pity, nor will I relent. You will be judged according to your conduct and your actions, declares the Sovereign <span class="name">Lord</span>.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Ezekiel&#8217;s Wife Dies</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>The word of the <span class="name">Lord</span> came to me: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, with one blow I am about to take away from you the delight of your eyes. Yet do not lament or weep or shed any tears. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Groan quietly; do not mourn for the dead. Keep your turban fastened and your sandals on your feet; do not cover your mustache and beard or eat the customary food of mourners.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>So I spoke to the people in the morning, and in the evening my wife died. The next morning I did as I had been commanded.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then the people asked me, &#8220;Won&#8217;t you tell us what these things have to do with us? Why are you acting like this?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So I said to them, &#8220;The word of the <span class="name">Lord</span> came to me:

The sons and daughters you left behind will fall by the sword. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And you will do as I have done. You will not cover your mustache and beard or eat the customary food of mourners. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>You will keep your turbans on your heads and your sandals on your feet. You will not mourn or weep but will waste away because of

 your sins and groan among yourselves. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Ezekiel will be a sign to you; you will do just as he has done. When this happens, you will know that I am the Sovereign <span class="name">Lord</span>.&#8217;</p>
