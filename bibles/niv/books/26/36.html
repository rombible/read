<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>This is what the Sovereign <span class="name">Lord</span> says: The enemy said of you, &#8220;Aha! The ancient heights have become our possession.&#8221;&#8239;&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Therefore prophesy and say, &#8216;This is what the Sovereign <span class="name">Lord</span> says: Because they ravaged and crushed you from every side so that you became the possession of the rest of the nations and the object of people&#8217;s malicious talk and slander, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>therefore, mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Sovereign <span class="name">Lord</span>: This is what the Sovereign <span class="name">Lord</span> says to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys, to the desolate ruins and the deserted towns that have been plundered and ridiculed by the rest of the nations around you&#8212;

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel and say to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys: &#8216;This is what the Sovereign <span class="name">Lord</span> says: I speak in my jealous wrath because you have suffered the scorn of the nations. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Therefore this is what the Sovereign <span class="name">Lord</span> says: I swear with uplifted hand that the nations around you will also suffer scorn.</p>

<p class="sectionhead">Israel&#8217;s Restoration Assured</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Again the word of the <span class="name">Lord</span> came to me: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, when the people of Israel were living in their own land, they defiled it by their conduct and their actions. Their conduct was like a woman&#8217;s monthly uncleanness in my sight. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>So I poured out my wrath on them because they had shed blood in the land and because they had defiled it with their idols. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>I dispersed them among the nations, and they were scattered through the countries; I judged them according to their conduct and their actions. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And wherever they went among the nations they profaned my holy name, for it was said of them, &#8216;These are the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s people, and yet they had to leave his land.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>I had concern for my holy name, which the people of Israel profaned among the nations where they had gone.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>&#8220;Therefore say to the Israelites, &#8216;This is what the Sovereign <span class="name">Lord</span> says: It is not for your sake, people of Israel, that I am going to do these things, but for the sake of my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations where you have gone. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>I will show the holiness of my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, the name you have profaned among them.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;For I will take you out of the nations; I will gather you from all the countries and bring you back into your own land. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean; I will cleanse you from all your impurities and from all your idols. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And I will put my Spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then you will live in the land I gave your ancestors; you will be my people, and I will be your God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>I will save you from all your uncleanness. I will call for the grain and make it plentiful and will not bring famine upon you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>I will increase the fruit of the trees and the crops of the field, so that you will no longer suffer disgrace among the nations because of famine. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Then you will remember your evil ways and wicked deeds, and you will loathe yourselves for your sins and detestable practices.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;This is what the Sovereign <span class="name">Lord</span> says: On the day I cleanse you from all your sins, I will resettle your towns, and the ruins will be rebuilt. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>The desolate land will be cultivated instead of lying desolate in the sight of all who pass through it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>They will say, &#8220;This land that was laid waste has become like the garden of Eden; the cities that were lying in ruins, desolate and destroyed, are now fortified and inhabited.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Then the nations around you that remain will know that I the <span class="name">Lord</span> have rebuilt what was destroyed and have replanted what was desolate. I the <span class="name">Lord</span> have spoken, and I will do it.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>&#8220;This is what the Sovereign <span class="name">Lord</span> says: Once again I will yield to Israel&#8217;s plea and do this for them: I will make their people as numerous as sheep, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>as numerous as the flocks for offerings at Jerusalem during her appointed festivals.
