There at the entrance of the gate were twenty-five men, and I saw among them Jaazaniah son of Azzur and Pelatiah son of Benaiah, leaders of the people. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> said to me, &#8220;Son of man, these are the men who are plotting evil and giving wicked advice in this city. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>They say, &#8216;Haven&#8217;t our houses been recently rebuilt? This city is a pot, and we are the meat in it.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Therefore prophesy against them; prophesy, son of man.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then the Spirit of the <span class="name">Lord</span> came on me, and he told me to say: &#8220;This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> says: That is what you are saying, you leaders in Israel, but I know what is going through your mind. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>You have killed many people in this city and filled its streets with the dead.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8220;Therefore this is what the Sovereign <span class="name">Lord</span> says: The bodies you have thrown there are the meat and this city is the pot, but I will drive you out of it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>You fear the sword, and the sword is what I will bring against you, declares the Sovereign <span class="name">Lord</span>. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>I will drive you out of the city and deliver you into the hands of foreigners and inflict punishment on you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>You will fall by the sword, and I will execute judgment on you at the borders of Israel. Then you will know that I am the <span class="name">Lord</span>. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>This city will not be a pot for you, nor will you be the meat in it; I will execute judgment on you at the borders of Israel. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And you will know that I am the <span class="name">Lord</span>, for you have not followed my decrees or kept my laws but have conformed to the standards of the nations around you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Now as I was prophesying, Pelatiah son of Benaiah died. Then I fell facedown and cried out in a loud voice, &#8220;Alas, Sovereign <span class="name">Lord</span>! Will you completely destroy the remnant of Israel?&#8221;</p>
<p class="sectionhead">The Promise of Israel&#8217;s Return</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>The word of the <span class="name">Lord</span> came to me: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, the people of Jerusalem have said of your fellow exiles and all the other Israelites, &#8216;They are far away from the <span class="name">Lord</span>; this land was given to us as our possession.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>&#8220;Therefore say: &#8216;This is what the Sovereign <span class="name">Lord</span> says: Although I sent them far away among the nations and scattered them among the countries, yet for a little while I have been a sanctuary for them in the countries where they have gone.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>&#8220;Therefore say: &#8216;This is what the Sovereign <span class="name">Lord</span> says: I will gather you from the nations and bring you back from the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you back the land of Israel again.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>&#8220;They will return to it and remove all its vile images and detestable idols. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>I will give them an undivided heart and put a new spirit in them; I will remove from them their heart of stone and give them a heart of flesh. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then they will follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws. They will be my people, and I will be their God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>But as for those whose hearts are devoted to their vile images and detestable idols, I will bring down on their own heads what they have done, declares the Sovereign <span class="name">Lord</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then the cherubim, with the wheels beside them, spread their wings, and the glory of the God of Israel was above them.
