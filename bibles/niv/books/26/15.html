<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, how is the wood of a vine different from that of a branch from any of the trees in the forest? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Is wood ever taken from it to make anything useful? Do they make pegs from it to hang things on? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And after it is thrown on the fire as fuel and the fire burns both ends and chars the middle, is it then useful for anything? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>If it was not useful for anything when it was whole, how much less can it be made into something useful when the fire has burned it and it is charred?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>&#8220;Therefore this is what the Sovereign <span class="name">Lord</span> says: As I have given the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest as fuel for the fire, so will I treat the people living in Jerusalem. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>I will set my face against them. Although they have come out of the fire, the fire will yet consume them. And when I set my face against them, you will know that I am the <span class="name">Lord</span>. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>I will make the land desolate because they have been unfaithful, declares the Sovereign <span class="name">Lord</span>.&#8221;</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
