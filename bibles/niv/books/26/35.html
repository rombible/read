<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir; prophesy against it 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and say: &#8216;This is what the Sovereign <span class="name">Lord</span> says: I am against you, Mount Seir, and I will stretch out my hand against you and make you a desolate waste. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>I will turn your towns into ruins and you will be desolate. Then you will know that I am the <span class="name">Lord</span>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;Because you harbored an ancient hostility and delivered the Israelites over to the sword at the time of their calamity, the time their punishment reached its climax, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>therefore as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign <span class="name">Lord</span>, I will give you over to bloodshed and it will pursue you. Since you did not hate bloodshed, bloodshed will pursue you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>I will make Mount Seir a desolate waste and cut off from it all who come and go. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>I will fill your mountains with the slain; those killed by the sword will fall on your hills and in your valleys and in all your ravines. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>I will make you desolate forever; your towns will not be inhabited. Then you will know that I am the <span class="name">Lord</span>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;Because you have said, &#8220;These two nations and countries will be ours and we will take possession of them,&#8221; even though I the <span class="name">Lord</span> was there, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>therefore as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign <span class="name">Lord</span>, I will treat you in accordance with the anger and jealousy you showed in your hatred of them and I will make myself known among them when I judge you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then you will know that I the <span class="name">Lord</span> have heard all the contemptible things you have said against the mountains of Israel. You said, &#8220;They have been laid waste and have been given over to us to devour.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>You boasted against me and spoke against me without restraint, and I heard it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>This is what the Sovereign <span class="name">Lord</span> says: While the whole earth rejoices, I will make you desolate. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Because you rejoiced when the inheritance of Israel became desolate, that is how I will treat you. You will be desolate, Mount Seir, you and all of Edom. Then they will know that I am the <span class="name">Lord</span>.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
