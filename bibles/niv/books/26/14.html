<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then the word of the <span class="name">Lord</span> came to me: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, these men have set up idols in their hearts and put wicked stumbling blocks before their faces. Should I let them inquire of me at all? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Therefore speak to them and tell them, &#8216;This is what the Sovereign <span class="name">Lord</span> says: When any of the Israelites set up idols in their hearts and put a wicked stumbling block before their faces and then go to a prophet, I the <span class="name">Lord</span> will answer them myself in keeping with their great idolatry. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>I will do this to recapture the hearts of the people of Israel, who have all deserted me for their idols.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>&#8220;Therefore say to the people of Israel, &#8216;This is what the Sovereign <span class="name">Lord</span> says: Repent! Turn from your idols and renounce all your detestable practices!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;When any of the Israelites or any foreigner residing in Israel separate themselves from me and set up idols in their hearts and put a wicked stumbling block before their faces and then go to a prophet to inquire of me, I the <span class="name">Lord</span> will answer them myself. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>I will set my face against them and make them an example and a byword. I will remove them from my people. Then you will know that I am the <span class="name">Lord</span>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;And if the prophet is enticed to utter a prophecy, I the <span class="name">Lord</span> have enticed that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand against him and destroy him from among my people Israel. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>They will bear their guilt&#8212;the prophet will be as guilty as the one who consults him.
