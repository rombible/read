The water was coming down from under the south side of the temple, south of the altar. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>He then brought me out through the north gate and led me around the outside to the outer gate facing east, and the water was trickling from the south side.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>As the man went eastward with a measuring line in his hand, he measured off a thousand cubits
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, about 1,700 feet or about 530 meters">a</a></sup></span>
 and then led me through water that was ankle-deep. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>He measured off another thousand cubits and led me through water that was knee-deep. He measured off another thousand and led me through water that was up to the waist. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>He measured off another thousand, but now it was a river that I could not cross, because the water had risen and was deep enough to swim in&#8212;a river that no one could cross. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>He asked me, &#8220;Son of man, do you see this?&#8221;</p><p class="reg">Then he led me back to the bank of the river. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>When I arrived there, I saw a great number of trees on each side of the river. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>He said to me, &#8220;This water flows toward the eastern region and goes down into the Arabah,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or the Jordan Valley">b</a></sup></span>
 where it enters the Dead Sea. When it empties into the sea, the salty water there becomes fresh. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Swarms of living creatures will live wherever the river flows. There will be large numbers of fish, because this water flows there and makes the salt water fresh; so where the river flows everything will live. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Fishermen will stand along the shore; from En Gedi to En Eglaim there will be places for spreading nets. The fish will be of many kinds&#8212;like the fish of the Mediterranean Sea. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But the swamps and marshes will not become fresh; they will be left for salt. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Fruit trees of all kinds will grow on both banks of the river. Their leaves will not wither, nor will their fruit fail. Every month they will bear fruit, because the water from the sanctuary flows to them. Their fruit will serve for food and their leaves for healing.&#8221;</p>
