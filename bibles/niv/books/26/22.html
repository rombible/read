<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, will you judge her? Will you judge this city of bloodshed? Then confront her with all her detestable practices 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and say: &#8216;This is what the Sovereign <span class="name">Lord</span> says: You city that brings on herself doom by shedding blood in her midst and defiles herself by making idols, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>you have become guilty because of the blood you have shed and have become defiled by the idols you have made. You have brought your days to a close, and the end of your years has come. Therefore I will make you an object of scorn to the nations and a laughingstock to all the countries. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Those who are near and those who are far away will mock you, you infamous city, full of turmoil.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;See how each of the princes of Israel who are in you uses his power to shed blood. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>In you they have treated father and mother with contempt; in you they have oppressed the foreigner and mistreated the fatherless and the widow. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>You have despised my holy things and desecrated my Sabbaths. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>In you are slanderers who are bent on shedding blood; in you are those who eat at the mountain shrines and commit lewd acts. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>In you are those who dishonor their father&#8217;s bed; in you are those who violate women during their period, when they are ceremonially unclean. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>In you one man commits a detestable offense with his neighbor&#8217;s wife, another shamefully defiles his daughter-in-law, and another violates his sister, his own father&#8217;s daughter. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>In you are people who accept bribes to shed blood; you take interest and make a profit from the poor. You extort unjust gain from your neighbors. And you have forgotten me, declares the Sovereign <span class="name">Lord</span>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;I will surely strike my hands together at the unjust gain you have made and at the blood you have shed in your midst. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Will your courage endure or your hands be strong in the day I deal with you? I the <span class="name">Lord</span> have spoken, and I will do it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>I will disperse you among the nations and scatter you through the countries; and I will put an end to your uncleanness. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>When you have been defiled
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or When I have allotted you your inheritance">a</a></sup></span>
 in the eyes of the nations, you will know that I am the <span class="name">Lord</span>.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then the word of the <span class="name">Lord</span> came to me: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, the people of Israel have become dross to me; all of them are the copper, tin, iron and lead left inside a furnace. They are but the dross of silver. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Therefore this is what the Sovereign <span class="name">Lord</span> says: &#8216;Because you have all become dross, I will gather you into Jerusalem. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>As silver, copper, iron, lead and tin are gathered into a furnace to be melted with a fiery blast, so will I gather you in my anger and my wrath and put you inside the city and melt you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>I will gather you and I will blow on you with my fiery wrath, and you will be melted inside her. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>As silver is melted in a furnace, so you will be melted inside her, and you will know that I the <span class="name">Lord</span> have poured out my wrath on you.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Again the word of the <span class="name">Lord</span> came to me: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, say to the land, &#8216;You are a land that has not been cleansed or rained on in the day of wrath.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>There is a conspiracy of her princes
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Septuagint; Hebrew prophets">b</a></sup></span>
 within her like a roaring lion tearing its prey; they devour people, take treasures and precious things and make many widows within her. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Her priests do violence to my law and profane my holy things; they do not distinguish between the holy and the common; they teach that there is no difference between the unclean and the clean; and they shut their eyes to the keeping of my Sabbaths, so that I am profaned among them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Her officials within her are like wolves tearing their prey; they shed blood and kill people to make unjust gain. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Her prophets whitewash these deeds for them by false visions and lying divinations. They say, &#8216;This is what the Sovereign <span class="name">Lord</span> says&#8217;&#8212;when the <span class="name">Lord</span> has not spoken. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>The people of the land practice extortion and commit robbery; they oppress the poor and needy and mistreat the foreigner, denying them justice.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>&#8220;I looked for someone among them who would build up the wall and stand before me in the gap on behalf of the land so I would not have to destroy it, but I found no one.
