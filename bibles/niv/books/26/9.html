<div class="chap"><p class="sectionhead">Judgment on the Idolaters</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Then I heard him call out in a loud voice, &#8220;Bring near those who are appointed to execute judgment on the city, each with a weapon in his hand.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And I saw six men coming from the direction of the upper gate, which faces north, each with a deadly weapon in his hand. With them was a man clothed in linen who had a writing kit at his side. They came in and stood beside the bronze altar.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Now the glory of the God of Israel went up from above the cherubim, where it had been, and moved to the threshold of the temple. Then the <span class="name">Lord</span> called to the man clothed in linen who had the writing kit at his side 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and said to him, &#8220;Go throughout the city of Jerusalem and put a mark on the foreheads of those who grieve and lament over all the detestable things that are done in it.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>As I listened, he said to the others, &#8220;Follow him through the city and kill, without showing pity or compassion. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Slaughter the old men, the young men and women, the mothers and children, but do not touch anyone who has the mark. Begin at my sanctuary.&#8221; So they began with the old men who were in front of the temple.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then he said to them, &#8220;Defile the temple and fill the courts with the slain. Go!&#8221; So they went out and began killing throughout the city. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>While they were killing and I was left alone, I fell facedown, crying out, &#8220;Alas, Sovereign <span class="name">Lord</span>! Are you going to destroy the entire remnant of Israel in this outpouring of your wrath on Jerusalem?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>He answered me, &#8220;The sin of the people of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great; the land is full of bloodshed and the city is full of injustice. They say, &#8216;The <span class="name">Lord</span> has forsaken the land; the <span class="name">Lord</span> does not see.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So I will not look on them with pity or spare them, but I will bring down on their own heads what they have done.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then the man in linen with the writing kit at his side brought back word, saying, &#8220;I have done as you commanded.&#8221;</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
