<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then the word of the <span class="name">Lord</span> came to me: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8220;Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel and say to them, &#8216;This is what the Sovereign <span class="name">Lord</span> says: Have you come to inquire of me? As surely as I live, I will not let you inquire of me, declares the Sovereign <span class="name">Lord</span>.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8220;Will you judge them? Will you judge them, son of man? Then confront them with the detestable practices of their ancestors 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and say to them: &#8216;This is what the Sovereign <span class="name">Lord</span> says: On the day I chose Israel, I swore with uplifted hand to the descendants of Jacob and revealed myself to them in Egypt. With uplifted hand I said to them, &#8220;I am the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>On that day I swore to them that I would bring them out of Egypt into a land I had searched out for them, a land flowing with milk and honey, the most beautiful of all lands. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And I said to them, &#8220;Each of you, get rid of the vile images you have set your eyes on, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt. I am the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;But they rebelled against me and would not listen to me; they did not get rid of the vile images they had set their eyes on, nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt. So I said I would pour out my wrath on them and spend my anger against them in Egypt. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But for the sake of my name, I brought them out of Egypt. I did it to keep my name from being profaned in the eyes of the nations among whom they lived and in whose sight I had revealed myself to the Israelites. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Therefore I led them out of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>I gave them my decrees and made known to them my laws, by which the person who obeys them will live. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Also I gave them my Sabbaths as a sign between us, so they would know that I the <span class="name">Lord</span> made them holy.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;Yet the people of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness. They did not follow my decrees but rejected my laws&#8212;by which the person who obeys them will live&#8212;and they utterly desecrated my Sabbaths. So I said I would pour out my wrath on them and destroy them in the wilderness. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But for the sake of my name I did what would keep it from being profaned in the eyes of the nations in whose sight I had brought them out.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>because they rejected my laws and did not follow my decrees and desecrated my Sabbaths. For their hearts were devoted to their idols. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Yet I looked on them with pity and did not destroy them or put an end to them in the wilderness. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>I said to their children in the wilderness, &#8220;Do not follow the statutes of your parents or keep their laws or defile yourselves with their idols. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>I am the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God; follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;But the children rebelled against me: They did not follow my decrees, they were not careful to keep my laws, of which I said, &#8220;The person who obeys them will live by them,&#8221; and they desecrated my Sabbaths. So I said I would pour out my wrath on them and spend my anger against them in the wilderness. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But I withheld my hand, and for the sake of my name I did what would keep it from being profaned in the eyes of the nations in whose sight I had brought them out. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Also with uplifted hand I swore to them in the wilderness that I would disperse them among the nations and scatter them through the countries,

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>So I gave them other statutes that were not good and laws through which they could not live; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>I defiled them through their gifts&#8212;the sacrifice of every firstborn&#8212;that I might fill them with horror so they would know that I am the <span class="name">Lord</span>.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>&#8220;Therefore, son of man, speak to the people of Israel and say to them, &#8216;This is what the Sovereign <span class="name">Lord</span> says: In this also your ancestors blasphemed me by being unfaithful to me:
