<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and said to them, &#8220;You have done all that Moses the servant of the <span class="name">Lord</span> commanded, and you have obeyed me in everything I commanded. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For a long time now&#8212;to this very day&#8212;you have not deserted your fellow Israelites but have carried out the mission the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God gave you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Now that the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God has given them rest as he promised, return to your homes in the land that Moses the servant of the <span class="name">Lord</span> gave you on the other side of the Jordan. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But be very careful to keep the commandment and the law that Moses the servant of the <span class="name">Lord</span> gave you: to love the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God, to walk in obedience to him, to keep his commands, to hold fast to him and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then Joshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went to their homes. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>(To the half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given land in Bashan, and to the other half of the tribe Joshua gave land on the west side of the Jordan along with their fellow Israelites.) When Joshua sent them home, he blessed them, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>saying, &#8220;Return to your homes with your great wealth&#8212;with large herds of livestock, with silver, gold, bronze and iron, and a great quantity of clothing&#8212;and divide the plunder from your enemies with your fellow Israelites.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh left the Israelites at Shiloh in Canaan to return to Gilead, their own land, which they had acquired in accordance with the command of the <span class="name">Lord</span> through Moses.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>When they came to Geliloth near the Jordan in the land of Canaan, the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh built an imposing altar there by the Jordan.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So the Israelites sent Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, to the land of Gilead&#8212;to Reuben, Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>With him they sent ten of the chief men, one from each of the tribes of Israel, each the head of a family division among the Israelite clans.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Was not the sin of Peor enough for us? Up to this very day we have not cleansed ourselves from that sin, even though a plague fell on the community of the <span class="name">Lord</span>!

 did not wrath come on the whole community of Israel? He was not the only one who died for his sin.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then Reuben, Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh replied to the heads of the clans of Israel:

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>If we have built our own altar to turn away from the <span class="name">Lord</span> and to offer burnt offerings and grain offerings, or to sacrifice fellowship offerings on it, may the <span class="name">Lord</span> himself call us to account.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>&#8220;No! We did it for fear that some day your descendants might say to ours, &#8216;What do you have to do with the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> has made the Jordan a boundary between us and you&#8212;you Reubenites and Gadites!

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>&#8220;That is why we said, &#8216;Let us get ready and build an altar&#8212;but not for burnt offerings or sacrifices.&#8217;

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>&#8220;And we said, &#8216;If they ever say this to us, or to our descendants, we will answer: Look at the replica of the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s altar, which our ancestors built, not for burnt offerings and sacrifices, but as a witness between us and you.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>&#8220;Far be it from us to rebel against the <span class="name">Lord</span> and turn away from him today by building an altar for burnt offerings, grain offerings and sacrifices, other than the altar of the <span class="name">Lord</span> our God that stands before his tabernacle.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/22-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>When Phinehas the priest and the leaders of the community&#8212;the heads of the clans of the Israelites&#8212;heard what Reuben, Gad and Manasseh had to say, they were pleased.
