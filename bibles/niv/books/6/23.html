<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>summoned all Israel&#8212;their elders, leaders, judges and officials&#8212;and said to them: &#8220;I am very old. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>You yourselves have seen everything the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God has done to all these nations for your sake; it was the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God who fought for you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Remember how I have allotted as an inheritance for your tribes all the land of the nations that remain&#8212;the nations I conquered&#8212;between the Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea in the west. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> your God himself will push them out for your sake. He will drive them out before you, and you will take possession of their land, as the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God promised you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>&#8220;Be very strong; be careful to obey all that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, without turning aside to the right or to the left. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Do not associate with these nations that remain among you; do not invoke the names of their gods or swear by them. You must not serve them or bow down to them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But you are to hold fast to the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God, as you have until now.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;The <span class="name">Lord</span> has driven out before you great and powerful nations; to this day no one has been able to withstand you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>One of you routs a thousand, because the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God fights for you, just as he promised. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So be very careful to love the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>&#8220;But if you turn away and ally yourselves with the survivors of these nations that remain among you and if you intermarry with them and associate with them, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>then you may be sure that the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God will no longer drive out these nations before you. Instead, they will become snares and traps for you, whips on your backs and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from this good land, which the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God has given you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>&#8220;Now I am about to go the way of all the earth. You know with all your heart and soul that not one of all the good promises the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God gave you has failed. Every promise has been fulfilled; not one has failed. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But just as all the good things the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God has promised you have come to you, so he will bring on you all the evil things he has threatened, until the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God has destroyed you from this good land he has given you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>If you violate the covenant of the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God, which he commanded you, and go and serve other gods and bow down to them, the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s anger will burn against you, and you will quickly perish from the good land he has given you.&#8221;</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
