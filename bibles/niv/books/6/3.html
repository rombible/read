<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>After three days the officers went throughout the camp, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>giving orders to the people: &#8220;When you see the ark of the covenant of the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God, and the Levitical priests carrying it, you are to move out from your positions and follow it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then you will know which way to go, since you have never been this way before. But keep a distance of about two thousand cubits

 between you and the ark; do not go near it.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Joshua told the people, &#8220;Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the <span class="name">Lord</span> will do amazing things among you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Joshua said to the priests, &#8220;Take up the ark of the covenant and pass on ahead of the people.&#8221; So they took it up and went ahead of them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And the <span class="name">Lord</span> said to Joshua, &#8220;Today I will begin to exalt you in the eyes of all Israel, so they may know that I am with you as I was with Moses. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Tell the priests who carry the ark of the covenant: &#8216;When you reach the edge of the Jordan&#8217;s waters, go and stand in the river.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Joshua said to the Israelites, &#8220;Come here and listen to the words of the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>This is how you will know that the living God is among you and that he will certainly drive out before you the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites and Jebusites. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>See, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth will go into the Jordan ahead of you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now then, choose twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one from each tribe. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And as soon as the priests who carry the ark of the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8212;the Lord of all the earth&#8212;set foot in the Jordan, its waters flowing downstream will be cut off and stand up in a heap.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So when the people broke camp to cross the Jordan, the priests carrying the ark of the covenant went ahead of them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Now the Jordan is at flood stage all during harvest. Yet as soon as the priests who carried the ark reached the Jordan and their feet touched the water&#8217;s edge, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>the water from upstream stopped flowing. It piled up in a heap a great distance away, at a town called Adam in the vicinity of Zarethan, while the water flowing down to the Sea of the Arabah (that is, the Dead Sea) was completely cut off. So the people crossed over opposite Jericho. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>The priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the <span class="name">Lord</span> stopped in the middle of the Jordan and stood on dry ground, while all Israel passed by until the whole nation had completed the crossing on dry ground.</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><A name="footnotes"></a><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotebot">That is, about 3,000 feet or about 900 meters</span><br><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
