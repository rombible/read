<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/14-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Their inheritances were assigned by lot to the nine-and-a-half tribes, as the <span class="name">Lord</span> had commanded through Moses. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/14-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Moses had granted the two-and-a-half tribes their inheritance east of the Jordan but had not granted the Levites an inheritance among the rest, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/14-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>for Joseph&#8217;s descendants had become two tribes&#8212;Manasseh and Ephraim. The Levites received no share of the land but only towns to live in, with pasturelands for their flocks and herds. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/14-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So the Israelites divided the land, just as the <span class="name">Lord</span> had commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Allotment for Caleb</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/14-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now the people of Judah approached Joshua at Gilgal, and Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, &#8220;You know what the <span class="name">Lord</span> said to Moses the man of God at Kadesh Barnea about you and me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/14-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the <span class="name">Lord</span> sent me from Kadesh Barnea to explore the land. And I brought him back a report according to my convictions, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/14-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>but my fellow Israelites who went up with me made the hearts of the people melt in fear. I, however, followed the <span class="name">Lord</span> my God wholeheartedly. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/14-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So on that day Moses swore to me, &#8216;The land on which your feet have walked will be your inheritance and that of your children forever, because you have followed the <span class="name">Lord</span> my God wholeheartedly.&#8217;

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/14-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8220;Now then, just as the <span class="name">Lord</span> promised, he has kept me alive for forty-five years since the time he said this to Moses, while Israel moved about in the wilderness. So here I am today, eighty-five years old! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/14-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>I am still as strong today as the day Moses sent me out; I&#8217;m just as vigorous to go out to battle now as I was then. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/14-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now give me this hill country that the <span class="name">Lord</span> promised me that day. You yourself heard then that the Anakites were there and their cities were large and fortified, but, the <span class="name">Lord</span> helping me, I will drive them out just as he said.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/14-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then Joshua blessed Caleb son of Jephunneh and gave him Hebron as his inheritance. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/14-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So Hebron has belonged to Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite ever since, because he followed the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, wholeheartedly.
