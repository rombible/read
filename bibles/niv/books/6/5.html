 had crossed over, their hearts melted in fear and they no longer had the courage to face the Israelites.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Circumcision and Passover at Gilgal</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>At that time the <span class="name">Lord</span> said to Joshua, &#8220;Make flint knives and circumcise the Israelites again.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the Israelites at Gibeath Haaraloth.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Now this is why he did so: All those who came out of Egypt&#8212;all the men of military age&#8212;died in the wilderness on the way after leaving Egypt. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>All the people that came out had been circumcised, but all the people born in the wilderness during the journey from Egypt had not. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>The Israelites had moved about in the wilderness forty years until all the men who were of military age when they left Egypt had died, since they had not obeyed the <span class="name">Lord</span>. For the <span class="name">Lord</span> had sworn to them that they would not see the land he had solemnly promised their ancestors to give us, a land flowing with milk and honey. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So he raised up their sons in their place, and these were the ones Joshua circumcised. They were still uncircumcised because they had not been circumcised on the way. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And after the whole nation had been circumcised, they remained where they were in camp until they were healed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then the <span class="name">Lord</span> said to Joshua, &#8220;Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you.&#8221; So the place has been called Gilgal

 to this day.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>On the evening of the fourteenth day of the month, while camped at Gilgal on the plains of Jericho, the Israelites celebrated the Passover. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>The day after the Passover, that very day, they ate some of the produce of the land: unleavened bread and roasted grain.

<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or the day">d</a></sup></span>
 they ate this food from the land; there was no longer any manna for the Israelites, but that year they ate the produce of Canaan.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">The Fall of Jericho</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/5-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Now when Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him with a drawn sword in his hand.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/5-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>&#8220;Neither,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;but as commander of the army of the <span class="name">Lord</span> I have now come.&#8221; Then Joshua fell facedown to the ground in reverence, and asked him, &#8220;What message does my Lord
