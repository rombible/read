 it, doing to Ai and its king as he had done to Jericho and its king, and that the people of Gibeon had made a treaty of peace with Israel and had become their allies. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>He and his people were very much alarmed at this, because Gibeon was an important city, like one of the royal cities; it was larger than Ai, and all its men were good fighters. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem appealed to Hoham king of Hebron, Piram king of Jarmuth, Japhia king of Lachish and Debir king of Eglon. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8220;Come up and help me attack Gibeon,&#8221; he said, &#8220;because it has made peace with Joshua and the Israelites.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then the five kings of the Amorites&#8212;the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish and Eglon&#8212;joined forces. They moved up with all their troops and took up positions against Gibeon and attacked it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>The Gibeonites then sent word to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal: &#8220;Do not abandon your servants. Come up to us quickly and save us! Help us, because all the Amorite kings from the hill country have joined forces against us.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So Joshua marched up from Gilgal with his entire army, including all the best fighting men. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> said to Joshua, &#8220;Do not be afraid of them; I have given them into your hand. Not one of them will be able to withstand you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>After an all-night march from Gilgal, Joshua took them by surprise. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> threw them into confusion before Israel, so Joshua and the Israelites defeated them completely at Gibeon. Israel pursued them along the road going up to Beth Horon and cut them down all the way to Azekah and Makkedah. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>As they fled before Israel on the road down from Beth Horon to Azekah, the <span class="name">Lord</span> hurled large hailstones down on them, and more of them died from the hail than were killed by the swords of the Israelites.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>On the day the <span class="name">Lord</span> gave the Amorites over to Israel, Joshua said to the <span class="name">Lord</span> in the presence of Israel:</p><div class="stanza"><p class="line1">&#8220;Sun, stand still over Gibeon,</p><p class="line2">and you, moon, over the Valley of Aijalon.&#8221;</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So the sun stood still,</p><p class="line2">and the moon stopped,</p><p class="line2">till the nation avenged itself on

 its enemies,</p></div><p class="pcontinued">as it is written in the Book of Jashar.</p><p class="reg">The sun stopped in the middle of the sky and delayed going down about a full day.

<p class="sectionhead">Five Amorite Kings Killed</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Now the five kings had fled and hidden in the cave at Makkedah. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>When Joshua was told that the five kings had been found hiding in the cave at Makkedah, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>he said, &#8220;Roll large rocks up to the mouth of the cave, and post some men there to guard it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>But don&#8217;t stop; pursue your enemies! Attack them from the rear and don&#8217;t let them reach their cities, for the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God has given them into your hand.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So Joshua and the Israelites defeated them completely, but a few survivors managed to reach their fortified cities. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>The whole army then returned safely to Joshua in the camp at Makkedah, and no one uttered a word against the Israelites.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Joshua said, &#8220;Open the mouth of the cave and bring those five kings out to me.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>So they brought the five kings out of the cave&#8212;the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish and Eglon. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>When they had brought these kings to Joshua, he summoned all the men of Israel and said to the army commanders who had come with him, &#8220;Come here and put your feet on the necks of these kings.&#8221; So they came forward and placed their feet on their necks.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Joshua said to them, &#8220;Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged. Be strong and courageous.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Then Joshua put the kings to death and exposed their bodies on five poles, and they were left hanging on the poles until evening.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>At sunset Joshua gave the order and they took them down from the poles and threw them into the cave where they had been hiding.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Then Joshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to Hebron and attacked it.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/10-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>Then Joshua and all Israel with him turned around and attacked Debir.
