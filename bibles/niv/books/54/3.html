<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Now the overseer is to be above reproach, faithful to his wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money.

 respect. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>(If anyone does not know how to manage his own family, how can he take care of God&#8217;s church?) 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>He must not be a recent convert, or he may become conceited and fall under the same judgment as the devil. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>He must also have a good reputation with outsiders, so that he will not fall into disgrace and into the devil&#8217;s trap.</p>

 are to be worthy of respect, sincere, not indulging in much wine, and not pursuing dishonest gain. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>They must keep hold of the deep truths of the faith with a clear conscience. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>They must first be tested; and then if there is nothing against them, let them serve as deacons.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>In the same way, the women
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Possibly deacons' wives or women who are deacons">c</a></sup></span>
 are to be worthy of respect, not malicious talkers but temperate and trustworthy in everything.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>A deacon must be faithful to his wife and must manage his children and his household well. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Those who have served well gain an excellent standing and great assurance in their faith in Christ Jesus.</p>
