<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Have nothing to do with godless myths and old wives&#8217; tales; rather, train yourself to be godly. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>This is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>That is why we labor and strive, because we have put our hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all people, and especially of those who believe.</p>
