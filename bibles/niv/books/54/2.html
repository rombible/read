<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>This is good, and pleases God our Savior, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>who wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>who gave himself as a ransom for all people. This has now been witnessed to at the proper time. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And for this purpose I was appointed a herald and an apostle&#8212;I am telling the truth, I am not lying&#8212;and a true and faithful teacher of the Gentiles.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Therefore I want the men everywhere to pray, lifting up holy hands without anger or disputing. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>I also want the women to dress modestly, with decency and propriety, adorning themselves, not with elaborate hairstyles or gold or pearls or expensive clothes, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to worship God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>A woman
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or wife; also in verse 12">a</a></sup></span>
 should learn in quietness and full submission. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man;
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or over her husband">b</a></sup></span>
 she must be quiet. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For Adam was formed first, then Eve. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner.

 will be saved through childbearing&#8212;if they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety.</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><A name="footnotes"></a><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotebot">Or <i>wife</i>; also in verse 12</span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">12</span> <span class="footnotebot">Or <i>over her husband</i></span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">c</span> <span class="fnverse">15</span> <span class="footnotebot">Greek <i>she</i></span><br><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
