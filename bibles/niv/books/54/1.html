<p class="opening"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>To Timothy my true son in the faith:</p><p class="opening">Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Timothy Charged to Oppose False Teachers</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>As I urged you when I went into Macedonia, stay there in Ephesus so that you may command certain people not to teach false doctrines any longer 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>or to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies. Such things promote controversial speculations rather than advancing God&#8217;s work&#8212;which is by faith. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>The goal of this command is love, which comes from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Some have departed from these and have turned to meaningless talk. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>They want to be teachers of the law, but they do not know what they are talking about or what they so confidently affirm.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>We know that the law is good if one uses it properly. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>We also know that the law is made not for the righteous but for lawbreakers and rebels, the ungodly and sinful, the unholy and irreligious, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>for the sexually immoral, for those practicing homosexuality, for slave traders and liars and perjurers&#8212;and for whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>that conforms to the gospel concerning the glory of the blessed God, which he entrusted to me.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">The Lord&#8217;s Grace to Paul</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has given me strength, that he considered me trustworthy, appointing me to his service. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Even though I was once a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man, I was shown mercy because I acted in ignorance and unbelief. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>The grace of our Lord was poured out on me abundantly, along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners&#8212;of whom I am the worst. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But for that very reason I was shown mercy so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display his immense patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive eternal life. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">The Charge to Timothy Renewed</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Timothy, my son, I am giving you this command in keeping with the prophecies once made about you, so that by recalling them you may fight the battle well, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>holding on to faith and a good conscience, which some have rejected and so have suffered shipwreck with regard to the faith. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan to be taught not to blaspheme.</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
