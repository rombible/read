<p class="sectionhead">Preparations for the Temple</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So David gave orders to assemble the foreigners residing in Israel, and from among them he appointed stonecutters to prepare dressed stone for building the house of God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>He provided a large amount of iron to make nails for the doors of the gateways and for the fittings, and more bronze than could be weighed. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>He also provided more cedar logs than could be counted, for the Sidonians and Tyrians had brought large numbers of them to David.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>David said, &#8220;My son Solomon is young and inexperienced, and the house to be built for the <span class="name">Lord</span> should be of great magnificence and fame and splendor in the sight of all the nations.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then he called for his son Solomon and charged him to build a house for the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>David said to Solomon: &#8220;My son, I had it in my heart to build a house for the Name of the <span class="name">Lord</span> my God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But this word of the <span class="name">Lord</span> came to me: &#8216;You have shed much blood and have fought many wars.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But you will have a son who will be a man of peace and rest, and I will give him rest from all his enemies on every side. His name will be Solomon,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Solomon sounds like and may be derived from the Hebrew for peace.">a</a></sup></span>
 and I will grant Israel peace and quiet during his reign. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>He is the one who will build a house for my Name. He will be my son, and I will be his father. And I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.&#8217;</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>May the <span class="name">Lord</span> give you discretion and understanding when he puts you in command over Israel, so that you may keep the law of the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God.
