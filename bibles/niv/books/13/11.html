<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>In the past, even while Saul was king, you were the one who led Israel on their military campaigns. And the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God said to you, &#8216;You will shepherd my people Israel, and you will become their ruler.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>When all the elders of Israel had come to King David at Hebron, he made a covenant with them at Hebron before the <span class="name">Lord</span>, and they anointed David king over Israel, as the <span class="name">Lord</span> had promised through Samuel.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">David Conquers Jerusalem</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>David and all the Israelites marched to Jerusalem (that is, Jebus). The Jebusites who lived there 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>said to David, &#8220;You will not get in here.&#8221; Nevertheless, David captured the fortress of Zion&#8212;which is the City of David.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>David had said, &#8220;Whoever leads the attack on the Jebusites will become commander-in-chief.&#8221; Joab son of Zeruiah went up first, and so he received the command.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>David then took up residence in the fortress, and so it was called the City of David. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>He built up the city around it, from the terraces
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or the Millo">a</a></sup></span>
 to the surrounding wall, while Joab restored the rest of the city. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And David became more and more powerful, because the <span class="name">Lord</span> Almighty was with him.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">David&#8217;s Mighty Warriors</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>These were the chiefs of David&#8217;s mighty warriors&#8212;they, together with all Israel, gave his kingship strong support to extend it over the whole land, as the <span class="name">Lord</span> had promised&#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>this is the list of David&#8217;s mighty warriors:</p><p class="reg">Jashobeam,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Possibly a variant of Jashob-Baal">b</a></sup></span>
 a Hakmonite, was chief of the officers
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or Thirty; some Septuagint manuscripts Three (see also 2 Samuel 23:8)">c</a></sup></span>
; he raised his spear against three hundred men, whom he killed in one encounter.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Next to him was Eleazar son of Dodai the Ahohite, one of the three mighty warriors. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>He was with David at Pas Dammim when the Philistines gathered there for battle. At a place where there was a field full of barley, the troops fled from the Philistines. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But they took their stand in the middle of the field. They defended it and struck the Philistines down, and the <span class="name">Lord</span> brought about a great victory.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Three of the thirty chiefs came down to David to the rock at the cave of Adullam, while a band of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>At that time David was in the stronghold, and the Philistine garrison was at Bethlehem. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>David longed for water and said, &#8220;Oh, that someone would get me a drink of water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>So the Three broke through the Philistine lines, drew water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem and carried it back to David. But he refused to drink it; instead, he poured it out to the <span class="name">Lord</span>. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>&#8220;God forbid that I should do this!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Should I drink the blood of these men who went at the risk of their lives?&#8221; Because they risked their lives to bring it back, David would not drink it.</p><p class="reg">Such were the exploits of the three mighty warriors.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Abishai the brother of Joab was chief of the Three. He raised his spear against three hundred men, whom he killed, and so he became as famous as the Three. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>He was doubly honored above the Three and became their commander, even though he was not included among them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Benaiah son of Jehoiada, a valiant fighter from Kabzeel, performed great exploits. He struck down Moab&#8217;s two mightiest warriors. He also went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And he struck down an Egyptian who was five cubits
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, about 7 feet 6 inches or about 2.3 meters">d</a></sup></span>
 tall. Although the Egyptian had a spear like a weaver&#8217;s rod in his hand, Benaiah went against him with a club. He snatched the spear from the Egyptian&#8217;s hand and killed him with his own spear. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Such were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada; he too was as famous as the three mighty warriors. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>He was held in greater honor than any of the Thirty, but he was not included among the Three. And David put him in charge of his bodyguard.</p>
