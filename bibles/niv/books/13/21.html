<div class="chap"><p class="sectionhead">David Counts the Fighting Men</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Satan rose up against Israel and incited David to take a census of Israel. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So David said to Joab and the commanders of the troops, &#8220;Go and count the Israelites from Beersheba to Dan. Then report back to me so that I may know how many there are.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But Joab replied, &#8220;May the <span class="name">Lord</span> multiply his troops a hundred times over. My lord the king, are they not all my lord&#8217;s subjects? Why does my lord want to do this? Why should he bring guilt on Israel?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>The king&#8217;s word, however, overruled Joab; so Joab left and went throughout Israel and then came back to Jerusalem. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Joab reported the number of the fighting men to David: In all Israel there were one million one hundred thousand men who could handle a sword, including four hundred and seventy thousand in Judah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But Joab did not include Levi and Benjamin in the numbering, because the king&#8217;s command was repulsive to him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>This command was also evil in the sight of God; so he punished Israel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then David said to God, &#8220;I have sinned greatly by doing this. Now, I beg you, take away the guilt of your servant. I have done a very foolish thing.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> said to Gad, David&#8217;s seer, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8220;Go and tell David, &#8216;This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> says: I am giving you three options. Choose one of them for me to carry out against you.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So Gad went to David and said to him, &#8220;This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> says: &#8216;Take your choice: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>three years of famine, three months of being swept away
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew; Septuagint and Vulgate (see also 2 Samuel 24:13) of fleeing">a</a></sup></span>
 before your enemies, with their swords overtaking you, or three days of the sword of the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8212;days of plague in the land, with the angel of the <span class="name">Lord</span> ravaging every part of Israel.&#8217; Now then, decide how I should answer the one who sent me.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>David said to Gad, &#8220;I am in deep distress. Let me fall into the hands of the <span class="name">Lord</span>, for his mercy is very great; but do not let me fall into human hands.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So the <span class="name">Lord</span> sent a plague on Israel, and seventy thousand men of Israel fell dead. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And God sent an angel to destroy Jerusalem. But as the angel was doing so, the <span class="name">Lord</span> saw it and relented concerning the disaster and said to the angel who was destroying the people, &#8220;Enough! Withdraw your hand.&#8221; The angel of the <span class="name">Lord</span> was then standing at the threshing floor of Araunah
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew Ornan, a variant of Araunah; also in verses 18-28">b</a></sup></span>
 the Jebusite.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>David looked up and saw the angel of the <span class="name">Lord</span> standing between heaven and earth, with a drawn sword in his hand extended over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell facedown.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>David said to God, &#8220;Was it not I who ordered the fighting men to be counted? I, the shepherd,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Probable reading of the original Hebrew text (see 2 Samuel 24:17 and note); Masoretic Text does not have the shepherd.">c</a></sup></span>
 have sinned and done wrong. These are but sheep. What have they done? <span class="name">Lord</span> my God, let your hand fall on me and my family, but do not let this plague remain on your people.&#8221;</p>
<p class="sectionhead">David Builds an Altar</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then the angel of the <span class="name">Lord</span> ordered Gad to tell David to go up and build an altar to the <span class="name">Lord</span> on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>So David went up in obedience to the word that Gad had spoken in the name of the <span class="name">Lord</span>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>While Araunah was threshing wheat, he turned and saw the angel; his four sons who were with him hid themselves. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then David approached, and when Araunah looked and saw him, he left the threshing floor and bowed down before David with his face to the ground.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>David said to him, &#8220;Let me have the site of your threshing floor so I can build an altar to the <span class="name">Lord</span>, that the plague on the people may be stopped. Sell it to me at the full price.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Araunah said to David, &#8220;Take it! Let my lord the king do whatever pleases him. Look, I will give the oxen for the burnt offerings, the threshing sledges for the wood, and the wheat for the grain offering. I will give all this.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>But King David replied to Araunah, &#8220;No, I insist on paying the full price.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>So David paid Araunah six hundred shekels
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, about 15 pounds or about 6.9 kilograms">d</a></sup></span>
 of gold for the site. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>David built an altar to the <span class="name">Lord</span> there and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Then the <span class="name">Lord</span> spoke to the angel, and he put his sword back into its sheath.
