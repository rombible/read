<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Nathan replied to David, &#8220;Whatever you have in mind, do it, for God is with you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But that night the word of God came to Nathan, saying:</p>
<p class="emb"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8220;Go and tell my servant David, &#8216;This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> says: You are not the one to build me a house to dwell in. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>I have not dwelt in a house from the day I brought Israel up out of Egypt to this day. I have moved from one tent site to another, from one dwelling place to another. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Wherever I have moved with all the Israelites, did I ever say to any of their leaders
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Traditionally judges; also in verse 10">a</a></sup></span>
 whom I commanded to shepherd my people, &#8220;Why have you not built me a house of cedar?&#8221;&#8239;&#8217;</p>
<p class="emb"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8220;Now then, tell my servant David, &#8216;This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> Almighty says: I took you from the pasture, from tending the flock, and appointed you ruler over my people Israel. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have cut off all your enemies from before you. Now I will make your name like the names of the greatest men on earth. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And I will provide a place for my people Israel and will plant them so that they can have a home of their own and no longer be disturbed. Wicked people will not oppress them anymore, as they did at the beginning 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and have done ever since the time I appointed leaders over my people Israel. I will also subdue all your enemies.</p><p class="emb">&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;I declare to you that the <span class="name">Lord</span> will build a house for you: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>When your days are over and you go to be with your ancestors, I will raise up your offspring to succeed you, one of your own sons, and I will establish his kingdom. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>He is the one who will build a house for me, and I will establish his throne forever. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>I will be his father, and he will be my son. I will never take my love away from him, as I took it away from your predecessor.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Nathan reported to David all the words of this entire revelation.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">David&#8217;s Prayer</p><p class="emb"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/17-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then King David went in and sat before the <span class="name">Lord</span>, and he said:</p><p class="emb">&#8220;Who am I, <span class="name">Lord</span> God, and what is my family, that you have brought me this far?
