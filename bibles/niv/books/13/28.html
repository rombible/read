<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>King David rose to his feet and said: &#8220;Listen to me, my fellow Israelites, my people. I had it in my heart to build a house as a place of rest for the ark of the covenant of the <span class="name">Lord</span>, for the footstool of our God, and I made plans to build it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But God said to me, &#8216;You are not to build a house for my Name, because you are a warrior and have shed blood.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8220;Yet the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, chose me from my whole family to be king over Israel forever. He chose Judah as leader, and from the tribe of Judah he chose my family, and from my father&#8217;s sons he was pleased to make me king over all Israel. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Of all my sons&#8212;and the <span class="name">Lord</span> has given me many&#8212;he has chosen my son Solomon to sit on the throne of the kingdom of the <span class="name">Lord</span> over Israel. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>He said to me: &#8216;Solomon your son is the one who will build my house and my courts, for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>I will establish his kingdom forever if he is unswerving in carrying out my commands and laws, as is being done at this time.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8220;So now I charge you in the sight of all Israel and of the assembly of the <span class="name">Lord</span>, and in the hearing of our God: Be careful to follow all the commands of the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God, that you may possess this good land and pass it on as an inheritance to your descendants forever.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;And you, my son Solomon, acknowledge the God of your father, and serve him with wholehearted devotion and with a willing mind, for the <span class="name">Lord</span> searches every heart and understands every desire and every thought. If you seek him, he will be found by you; but if you forsake him, he will reject you forever. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Consider now, for the <span class="name">Lord</span> has chosen you to build a house as the sanctuary. Be strong and do the work.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then David gave his son Solomon the plans for the portico of the temple, its buildings, its storerooms, its upper parts, its inner rooms and the place of atonement. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>He gave him the plans of all that the Spirit had put in his mind for the courts of the temple of the <span class="name">Lord</span> and all the surrounding rooms, for the treasuries of the temple of God and for the treasuries for the dedicated things. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>He gave him instructions for the divisions of the priests and Levites, and for all the work of serving in the temple of the <span class="name">Lord</span>, as well as for all the articles to be used in its service. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>He designated the weight of gold for all the gold articles to be used in various kinds of service, and the weight of silver for all the silver articles to be used in various kinds of service: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>the weight of gold for the gold lampstands and their lamps, with the weight for each lampstand and its lamps; and the weight of silver for each silver lampstand and its lamps, according to the use of each lampstand; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>the weight of gold for each table for consecrated bread; the weight of silver for the silver tables; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>the weight of pure gold for the forks, sprinkling bowls and pitchers; the weight of gold for each gold dish; the weight of silver for each silver dish; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>and the weight of the refined gold for the altar of incense. He also gave him the plan for the chariot, that is, the cherubim of gold that spread their wings and overshadow the ark of the covenant of the <span class="name">Lord</span>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>&#8220;All this,&#8221; David said, &#8220;I have in writing as a result of the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s hand on me, and he enabled me to understand all the details of the plan.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>David also said to Solomon his son, &#8220;Be strong and courageous, and do the work. Do not be afraid or discouraged, for the <span class="name">Lord</span> God, my God, is with you. He will not fail you or forsake you until all the work for the service of the temple of the <span class="name">Lord</span> is finished. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>The divisions of the priests and Levites are ready for all the work on the temple of God, and every willing person skilled in any craft will help you in all the work. The officials and all the people will obey your every command.&#8221;</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
