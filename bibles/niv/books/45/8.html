 free from the law of sin and death. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For what the law was powerless to do because it was weakened by the flesh,

 God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh to be a sin offering.

 And so he condemned sin in the flesh, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fully met in us, who do not live according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Those who live according to the flesh have their minds set on what the flesh desires; but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>The mind governed by the flesh is death, but the mind governed by the Spirit is life and peace. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>The mind governed by the flesh is hostile to God; it does not submit to God&#8217;s law, nor can it do so.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>You, however, are not in the realm of the flesh but are in the realm of the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God lives in you. And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, they do not belong to Christ. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>But if Christ is in you, then even though your body is subject to death because of sin, the Spirit gives life

 because of righteousness. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies because of

 his Spirit who lives in you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Therefore, brothers and sisters, we have an obligation&#8212;but it is not to the flesh, to live according to it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For if you live according to the flesh, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body, you will live.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For those who are led by the Spirit of God are the children of God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>The Spirit you received does not make you slaves, so that you live in fear again; rather, the Spirit you received brought about your adoption to sonship.
