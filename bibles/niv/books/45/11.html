<div class="chap"><p class="sectionhead">The Remnant of Israel</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>I ask then: Did God reject his people? By no means! I am an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>God did not reject his people, whom he foreknew. Don&#8217;t you know what Scripture says in the passage about Elijah&#8212;how he appealed to God against Israel: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8220;Lord, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars; I am the only one left, and they are trying to kill me&#8221;
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="1 Kings 19:10,14">a</a></sup></span>
? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And what was God&#8217;s answer to him? &#8220;I have reserved for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal.&#8221;
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="1 Kings 19:18">b</a></sup></span>
 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So too, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And if by grace, then it cannot be based on works; if it were, grace would no longer be grace.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>What then? What the people of Israel sought so earnestly they did not obtain. The elect among them did, but the others were hardened, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>as it is written:</p><div class="stanza"><p class="line1">&#8220;God gave them a spirit of stupor,</p><p class="line2">eyes that could not see</p><p class="line2">and ears that could not hear,</p><p class="line1">to this very day.&#8221;
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Deut. 29:4; Isaiah 29:10">c</a></sup></span>

<p class="pcontinued"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And David says:</p><div class="stanza"><p class="line1">&#8220;May their table become a snare and a trap,</p><p class="line2">a stumbling block and a retribution for them.</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see,</p><p class="line2">and their backs be bent forever.&#8221;

<p class="sectionhead">Ingrafted Branches</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Again I ask: Did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery? Not at all! Rather, because of their transgression, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel envious. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But if their transgression means riches for the world, and their loss means riches for the Gentiles, how much greater riches will their full inclusion bring!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>I am talking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I take pride in my ministry 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>in the hope that I may somehow arouse my own people to envy and save some of them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>For if their rejection brought reconciliation to the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>If the part of the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, then the whole batch is holy; if the root is holy, so are the branches.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>If some of the branches have been broken off, and you, though a wild olive shoot, have been grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing sap from the olive root, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>do not consider yourself to be superior to those other branches. If you do, consider this: You do not support the root, but the root supports you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>You will say then, &#8220;Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Granted. But they were broken off because of unbelief, and you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but tremble. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>For if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Consider therefore the kindness and sternness of God: sternness to those who fell, but kindness to you, provided that you continue in his kindness. Otherwise, you also will be cut off. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And if they do not persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>After all, if you were cut out of an olive tree that is wild by nature, and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more readily will these, the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree!</p>
