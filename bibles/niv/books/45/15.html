<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For even Christ did not please himself but, as it is written: &#8220;The insults of those who insult you have fallen on me.&#8221;

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>May the God who gives endurance and encouragement give you the same attitude of mind toward each other that Christ Jesus had,

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Accept one another, then, just as Christ accepted you, in order to bring praise to God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the Jews

<p class="sectionhead">Paul the Minister to the Gentiles</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>I myself am convinced, my brothers and sisters, that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with knowledge and competent to instruct one another. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Yet I have written you quite boldly on some points to remind you of them again, because of the grace God gave me 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles. He gave me the priestly duty of proclaiming the gospel of God, so that the Gentiles might become an offering acceptable to God, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Therefore I glory in Christ Jesus in my service to God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me in leading the Gentiles to obey God by what I have said and done&#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>by the power of signs and wonders, through the power of the Spirit of God. So from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum, I have fully proclaimed the gospel of Christ. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>It has always been my ambition to preach the gospel where Christ was not known, so that I would not be building on someone else&#8217;s foundation. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Rather, as it is written:</p><div class="stanza"><p class="line1">&#8220;Those who were not told about him will see,</p><p class="line2">and those who have not heard will understand.&#8221;

<p class="sectionhead">Paul&#8217;s Plan to Visit Rome</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>But now that there is no more place for me to work in these regions, and since I have been longing for many years to visit you, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>I plan to do so when I go to Spain. I hope to see you while passing through and to have you assist me on my journey there, after I have enjoyed your company for a while. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Now, however, I am on my way to Jerusalem in the service of the Lord&#8217;s people there. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>For Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the Lord&#8217;s people in Jerusalem. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>They were pleased to do it, and indeed they owe it to them. For if the Gentiles have shared in the Jews&#8217; spiritual blessings, they owe it to the Jews to share with them their material blessings. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>So after I have completed this task and have made sure that they have received this contribution, I will go to Spain and visit you on the way.
