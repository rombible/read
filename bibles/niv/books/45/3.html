<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Much in every way! First of all, the Jews have been entrusted with the very words of God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>What if some were unfaithful? Will their unfaithfulness nullify God&#8217;s faithfulness? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Not at all! Let God be true, and every human being a liar.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But if our unrighteousness brings out God&#8217;s righteousness more clearly, what shall we say? That God is unjust in bringing his wrath on us? (I am using a human argument.) 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Certainly not! If that were so, how could God judge the world? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Someone might argue, &#8220;If my falsehood enhances God&#8217;s truthfulness and so increases his glory, why am I still condemned as a sinner?&#8221;
