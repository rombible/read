<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>For since the creation of the world God&#8217;s invisible qualities&#8212;his eternal power and divine nature&#8212;have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like a mortal human being and birds and animals and reptiles.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>They exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator&#8212;who is forever praised. Amen.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Furthermore, just as they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, so God gave them over to a depraved mind, so that they do what ought not to be done.
