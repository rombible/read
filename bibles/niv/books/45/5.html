<div class="chap"><p class="sectionhead">Peace and Hope</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Many manuscripts let us">a</a></sup></span>
 have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand. And we
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or let us">b</a></sup></span>
 boast in the hope of the glory of God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Not only so, but we
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or let us">c</a></sup></span>
 also glory in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>perseverance, character; and character, hope. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And hope does not put us to shame, because God&#8217;s love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous person, though for a good person someone might possibly dare to die. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Since we have now been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved from God&#8217;s wrath through him! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For if, while we were God&#8217;s enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son, how much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through his life! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Not only is this so, but we also boast in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Death Through Adam, Life Through Christ</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all people, because all sinned&#8212;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>To be sure, sin was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not charged against anyone&#8217;s account where there is no law. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Nevertheless, death reigned from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, even over those who did not sin by breaking a command, as did Adam, who is a pattern of the one to come.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God&#8217;s grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Nor can the gift of God be compared with the result of one man&#8217;s sin: The judgment followed one sin and brought condemnation, but the gift followed many trespasses and brought justification. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive God&#8217;s abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Consequently, just as one trespass resulted in condemnation for all people, so also one righteous act resulted in justification and life for all people. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>The law was brought in so that the trespass might increase. But where sin increased, grace increased all the more, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>so that, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><A name="footnotes"></a><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotebot">Many manuscripts <i>let us</i></span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotebot">Or <i>let us</i></span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">c</span> <span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotebot">Or <i>let us</i></span><br><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
