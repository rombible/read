<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my people, those of my own race,

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Theirs are the patriarchs, and from them is traced the human ancestry of the Messiah, who is God over all, forever praised!

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Nor because they are his descendants are they all Abraham&#8217;s children. On the contrary, &#8220;It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.&#8221;

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>In other words, it is not the children by physical descent who are God&#8217;s children, but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as Abraham&#8217;s offspring. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For this was how the promise was stated: &#8220;At the appointed time I will return, and Sarah will have a son.&#8221;

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Just as it is written: &#8220;Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.&#8221;

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>For he says to Moses,</p><div class="stanza"><p class="line1">&#8220;I will have mercy on whom I have mercy,</p><p class="line2">and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.&#8221;
