<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Be shepherds of God&#8217;s flock that is under your care, watching over them&#8212;not because you must, but because you are willing, as God wants you to be; not pursuing dishonest gain, but eager to serve; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>not lording it over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that will never fade away.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>In the same way, you who are younger, submit yourselves to your elders. All of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because,</p><div class="stanza"><p class="line1">&#8220;God opposes the proud</p><p class="line2">but shows favor to the humble.&#8221;
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Prov. 3:34">a</a></sup></span>
</p></div>
<p class="pcontinued"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Humble yourselves, therefore, under God&#8217;s mighty hand, that he may lift you up in due time. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Resist him, standing firm in the faith, because you know that the family of believers throughout the world is undergoing the same kind of sufferings.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will himself restore you and make you strong, firm and steadfast. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>To him be the power for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
