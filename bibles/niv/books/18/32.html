<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/32-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>But Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became very angry with Job&#8239;for justifying himself rather than God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/32-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>He was also angry with the three friends, because they had found no way to refute Job, and yet had condemned him.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/32-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Now Elihu had waited before speaking to Job because they were older than he.
