 came to present themselves before the <span class="name">Lord</span>, and Satan also came with them to present himself before him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And the <span class="name">Lord</span> said to Satan, &#8220;Where have you come from?&#8221;</p><p class="reg">Satan answered the <span class="name">Lord</span>, &#8220;From roaming throughout the earth, going back and forth on it.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then the <span class="name">Lord</span> said to Satan, &#8220;Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil. And he still maintains his integrity, though you incited me against him to ruin him without any reason.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8220;Skin for skin!&#8221; Satan replied. &#8220;A man will give all he has for his own life. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But now stretch out your hand and strike his flesh and bones, and he will surely curse you to your face.&#8221;</p>
