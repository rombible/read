<div class="stanza"><p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/27-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;As surely as God lives, who has denied me justice,</p><p class="line2">the Almighty, who has made my life bitter,</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/27-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>as long as I have life within me,</p><p class="line2">the breath of God in my nostrils,</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/27-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>my lips will not say anything wicked,</p><p class="line2">and my tongue will not utter lies.</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/27-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>I will never admit you are in the right;</p><p class="line2">till I die, I will not deny my integrity.</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/27-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>I will maintain my innocence and never let go of it;</p><p class="line2">my conscience will not reproach me as long as I live.</p></div>
<div class="stanza"><p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/27-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8220;May my enemy be like the wicked,</p><p class="line2">my adversary like the unjust!</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/27-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For what hope have the godless when they are cut off,</p><p class="line2">when God takes away their life?</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/27-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Does God listen to their cry</p><p class="line2">when distress comes upon them?</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/27-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Will they find delight in the Almighty?</p><p class="line2">Will they call on God at all times?</p></div>
<div class="stanza"><p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/27-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8220;I will teach you about the power of God;</p><p class="line2">the ways of the Almighty I will not conceal.</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/27-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>You have all seen this yourselves.</p><p class="line2">Why then this meaningless talk?</p></div>
<div class="stanza"><p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/27-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8220;Here is the fate God allots to the wicked,</p><p class="line2">the heritage a ruthless man receives from the Almighty:</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/27-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>However many his children, their fate is the sword;</p><p class="line2">his offspring will never have enough to eat.</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/27-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>The plague will bury those who survive him,</p><p class="line2">and their widows will not weep for them.</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/27-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Though he heaps up silver like dust</p><p class="line2">and clothes like piles of clay,</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/27-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>what he lays up the righteous will wear,</p><p class="line2">and the innocent will divide his silver.</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/27-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>The house he builds is like a moth&#8217;s cocoon,</p><p class="line2">like a hut made by a watchman.</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/27-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>He lies down wealthy, but will do so no more;</p><p class="line2">when he opens his eyes, all is gone.</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/27-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Terrors overtake him like a flood;</p><p class="line2">a tempest snatches him away in the night.</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/27-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>The east wind carries him off, and he is gone;</p><p class="line2">it sweeps him out of his place.</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/27-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>It hurls itself against him without mercy</p><p class="line2">as he flees headlong from its power.</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/27-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>It claps its hands in derision</p><p class="line2">and hisses him out of his place.&#8221;</p></div><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
