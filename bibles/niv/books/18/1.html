<div class="chap"><p class="sectionhead">Prologue</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>In the land of Uz there lived a man whose name was Job. This man was blameless and upright; he feared God and shunned evil. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>He had seven sons and three daughters, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and he owned seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred donkeys, and had a large number of servants. He was the greatest man among all the people of the East.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>His sons used to hold feasts in their homes on their birthdays, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>When a period of feasting had run its course, Job would make arrangements for them to be purified. Early in the morning he would sacrifice a burnt offering for each of them, thinking, &#8220;Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.&#8221; This was Job&#8217;s regular custom.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>One day the angels
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew the sons of God">a</a></sup></span>
 came to present themselves before the <span class="name">Lord</span>, and Satan
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew satan means adversary.">b</a></sup></span>
 also came with them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> said to Satan, &#8220;Where have you come from?&#8221;</p><p class="reg">Satan answered the <span class="name">Lord</span>, &#8220;From roaming throughout the earth, going back and forth on it.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then the <span class="name">Lord</span> said to Satan, &#8220;Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;Does Job fear God for nothing?&#8221; Satan replied. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8220;Have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But now stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> said to Satan, &#8220;Very well, then, everything he has is in your power, but on the man himself do not lay a finger.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">Then Satan went out from the presence of the <span class="name">Lord</span>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>One day when Job&#8217;s sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother&#8217;s house, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>a messenger came to Job and said, &#8220;The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing nearby, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and the Sabeans attacked and made off with them. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, &#8220;The fire of God fell from the heavens and burned up the sheep and the servants, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, &#8220;The Chaldeans formed three raiding parties and swept down on your camels and made off with them. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>While he was still speaking, yet another messenger came and said, &#8220;Your sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother&#8217;s house, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>when suddenly a mighty wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on them and they are dead, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>At this, Job got up and tore his robe and shaved his head. Then he fell to the ground in worship 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>and said:</p><div class="stanza"><p class="line1">&#8220;Naked I came from my mother&#8217;s womb,</p><p class="line2">and naked I will depart.
