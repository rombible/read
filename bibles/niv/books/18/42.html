<div class="stanza"><p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/42-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;I know that you can do all things;</p><p class="line2">no purpose of yours can be thwarted.</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/42-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>You asked, &#8216;Who is this that obscures my plans without knowledge?&#8217;</p><p class="line2">Surely I spoke of things I did not understand,</p><p class="line2">things too wonderful for me to know.</p></div>
<div class="stanza"><p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/42-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8220;You said, &#8216;Listen now, and I will speak;</p><p class="line2">I will question you,</p><p class="line2">and you shall answer me.&#8217;</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/42-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>My ears had heard of you</p><p class="line2">but now my eyes have seen you.</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/42-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Therefore I despise myself</p><p class="line2">and repent in dust and ashes.&#8221;</p></div>
<p class="sectionhead">Epilogue</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/42-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>After the <span class="name">Lord</span> had said these things to Job, he said to Eliphaz the Temanite, &#8220;I am angry with you and your two friends, because you have not spoken the truth about me, as my servant Job&#8239;has. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/42-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So now take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and sacrifice a burnt offering for yourselves. My servant Job&#8239;will pray for you, and I will accept his prayer and not deal with you according to your folly. You have not spoken the truth about me, as my servant Job&#8239;has.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/42-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite did what the <span class="name">Lord</span> told them; and the <span class="name">Lord</span> accepted Job&#8217;s prayer.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/42-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>After Job had prayed for his friends, the <span class="name">Lord</span> restored his fortunes and gave him twice as much as he had before. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/42-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>All his brothers and sisters and everyone who had known him before came and ate with him in his house. They comforted and consoled him over all the trouble the <span class="name">Lord</span> had brought on him, and each one gave him a piece of silver
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew him a kesitah; a kesitah was a unit of money of unknown weight and value.">a</a></sup></span>
 and a gold ring.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/42-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> blessed the latter part of Job&#8217;s life more than the former part. He had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen and a thousand donkeys. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/42-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And he also had seven sons and three daughters. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/42-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>The first daughter he named Jemimah, the second Keziah and the third Keren-Happuch. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/42-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Nowhere in all the land were there found women as beautiful as Job&#8217;s daughters, and their father granted them an inheritance along with their brothers.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/42-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>After this, Job lived a hundred and forty years; he saw his children and their children to the fourth generation. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/42-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And so Job died, an old man and full of years.</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><A name="footnotes"></a><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotebot">Hebrew <i>him a kesitah</i>; a kesitah was a unit of money of unknown weight and value.</span><br><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
