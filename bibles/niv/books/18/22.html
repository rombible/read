<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/22-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>What pleasure would it give the Almighty if you were righteous?</p><p class="line2">What would he gain if your ways were blameless?</p></div>
<div class="stanza"><p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/22-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8220;Is it for your piety that he rebukes you</p><p class="line2">and brings charges against you?</p>

<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/22-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>You demanded security from your relatives for no reason;</p><p class="line2">you stripped people of their clothing, leaving them naked.</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/job/22-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>You gave no water to the weary</p><p class="line2">and you withheld food from the hungry,</p>
