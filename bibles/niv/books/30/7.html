<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/7-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>When they had stripped the land clean, I cried out, &#8220;Sovereign <span class="name">Lord</span>, forgive! How can Jacob survive? He is so small!&#8221;</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/7-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then I cried out, &#8220;Sovereign <span class="name">Lord</span>, I beg you, stop! How can Jacob survive? He is so small!&#8221;</p>

 in his hand. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/7-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And the <span class="name">Lord</span> asked me, &#8220;What do you see, Amos?&#8221;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;A plumb line,&#8221; I replied.</p><p class="reg">Then the Lord said, &#8220;Look, I am setting a plumb line among my people Israel; I will spare them no longer.</p>

<p class="sectionhead">Amos and Amaziah</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent a message to Jeroboam king of Israel: &#8220;Amos is raising a conspiracy against you in the very heart of Israel.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/7-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For this is what Amos is saying:</p><div class="stanza"><p class="line1">&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;Jeroboam will die by the sword,</p><p class="line2">and Israel will surely go into exile,</p><p class="line2">away from their native land.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p></div>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/7-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then Amaziah said to Amos, &#8220;Get out, you seer! Go back to the land of Judah. Earn your bread there and do your prophesying there. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/7-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Don&#8217;t prophesy anymore at Bethel, because this is the king&#8217;s sanctuary and the temple of the kingdom.&#8221;</p>
