<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then the king of Assyria sent his field commander with a large army from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. When the commander stopped at the aqueduct of the Upper Pool, on the road to the Launderer&#8217;s Field, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went out to him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>The field commander said to them, &#8220;Tell Hezekiah:</p><p class="emb">&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;This is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says: On what are you basing this confidence of yours? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>You say you have counsel and might for war&#8212;but you speak only empty words. On whom are you depending, that you rebel against me? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Look, I know you are depending on Egypt, that splintered reed of a staff, which pierces the hand of anyone who leans on it! Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who depend on him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But if you say to me, &#8220;We are depending on the <span class="name">Lord</span> our God&#8221;&#8212;isn&#8217;t he the one whose high places and altars Hezekiah removed, saying to Judah and Jerusalem, &#8220;You must worship before this altar&#8221;?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;Come now, make a bargain with my master, the king of Assyria: I will give you two thousand horses&#8212;if you can put riders on them! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>How then can you repulse one officer of the least of my master&#8217;s officials, even though you are depending on Egypt for chariots and horsemen

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then Eliakim, Shebna and Joah said to the field commander, &#8220;Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, since we understand it. Don&#8217;t speak to us in Hebrew in the hearing of the people on the wall.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But the commander replied, &#8220;Was it only to your master and you that my master sent me to say these things, and not to the people sitting on the wall&#8212;who, like you, will have to eat their own excrement and drink their own urine?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then the commander stood and called out in Hebrew, &#8220;Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria!

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>&#8220;Do not listen to Hezekiah.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>until I come and take you to a land like your own&#8212;a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.</p>
