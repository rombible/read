<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Above him were seraphim, each with six wings: With two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they were flying. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And they were calling to one another:</p><div class="stanza"><p class="line1">&#8220;Holy, holy, holy is the <span class="name">Lord</span> Almighty;</p><p class="line2">the whole earth is full of his glory.&#8221;</p></div>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>At the sound of their voices the doorposts and thresholds shook and the temple was filled with smoke.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8220;Woe to me!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;I am ruined! For I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips, and my eyes have seen the King, the <span class="name">Lord</span> Almighty.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then one of the seraphim flew to me with a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with tongs from the altar. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>With it he touched my mouth and said, &#8220;See, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away and your sin atoned for.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, &#8220;Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?&#8221;</p><p class="reg">And I said, &#8220;Here am I. Send me!&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>He said, &#8220;Go and tell this people:</p><div class="stanza"><p class="line1">&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;Be ever hearing, but never understanding;</p><p class="line2">be ever seeing, but never perceiving.&#8217;</p>
