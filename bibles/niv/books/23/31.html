<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Yet he too is wise and can bring disaster;</p><p class="line2">he does not take back his words.</p><p class="line1">He will rise up against that wicked nation,</p><p class="line2">against those who help evildoers.</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But the Egyptians are mere mortals and not God;</p><p class="line2">their horses are flesh and not spirit.</p><p class="line1">When the <span class="name">Lord</span> stretches out his hand,</p><p class="line2">those who help will stumble,</p><p class="line2">those who are helped will fall;</p><p class="line2">all will perish together.</p></div>
