The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz went to him and said, &#8220;This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> says: Put your house in order, because you are going to die; you will not recover.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the <span class="name">Lord</span>, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8220;Remember, <span class="name">Lord</span>, how I have walked before you faithfully and with wholehearted devotion and have done what is good in your eyes.&#8221; And Hezekiah wept bitterly.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then the word of the <span class="name">Lord</span> came to Isaiah: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8220;Go and tell Hezekiah, &#8216;This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the God of your father David, says: I have heard your prayer and seen your tears; I will add fifteen years to your life. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria. I will defend this city.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;This is the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s sign to you that the <span class="name">Lord</span> will do what he has promised: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>I will make the shadow cast by the sun go back the ten steps it has gone down on the stairway of Ahaz.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221; So the sunlight went back the ten steps it had gone down.</p>

<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>I said, &#8220;I will not again see the <span class="name">Lord</span> himself</p><p class="line2">in the land of the living;</p><p class="line1">no longer will I look on my fellow man,</p><p class="line2">or be with those who now dwell in this world.</p>
