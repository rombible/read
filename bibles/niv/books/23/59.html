<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>But your iniquities have separated</p><p class="line2">you from your God;</p><p class="line1">your sins have hidden his face from you,</p><p class="line2">so that he will not hear.</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For your hands are stained with blood,</p><p class="line2">your fingers with guilt.</p><p class="line1">Your lips have spoken falsely,</p><p class="line2">and your tongue mutters wicked things.</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>No one calls for justice;</p><p class="line2">no one pleads a case with integrity.</p><p class="line1">They rely on empty arguments, they utter lies;</p><p class="line2">they conceive trouble and give birth to evil.</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>They hatch the eggs of vipers</p><p class="line2">and spin a spider&#8217;s web.</p><p class="line1">Whoever eats their eggs will die,</p><p class="line2">and when one is broken, an adder is hatched.</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Their cobwebs are useless for clothing;</p><p class="line2">they cannot cover themselves with what they make.</p><p class="line1">Their deeds are evil deeds,</p><p class="line2">and acts of violence are in their hands.</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Their feet rush into sin;</p><p class="line2">they are swift to shed innocent blood.</p><p class="line1">They pursue evil schemes;</p><p class="line2">acts of violence mark their ways.</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>The way of peace they do not know;</p><p class="line2">there is no justice in their paths.</p><p class="line1">They have turned them into crooked roads;</p><p class="line2">no one who walks along them will know peace.</p></div>
<div class="stanza"><p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So justice is far from us,</p><p class="line2">and righteousness does not reach us.</p><p class="line1">We look for light, but all is darkness;</p><p class="line2">for brightness, but we walk in deep shadows.</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Like the blind we grope along the wall,</p><p class="line2">feeling our way like people without eyes.</p><p class="line1">At midday we stumble as if it were twilight;</p><p class="line2">among the strong, we are like the dead.</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>We all growl like bears;</p><p class="line2">we moan mournfully like doves.</p><p class="line1">We look for justice, but find none;</p><p class="line2">for deliverance, but it is far away.</p></div>
