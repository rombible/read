 the high priest:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> Almighty says: &#8220;These people say, &#8216;The time has not yet come to rebuild the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s house.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then the word of the <span class="name">Lord</span> came through the prophet Haggai: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8220;Is it a time for you yourselves to be living in your paneled houses, while this house remains a ruin?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now this is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> Almighty says: &#8220;Give careful thought to your ways. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>You have planted much, but harvested little. You eat, but never have enough. You drink, but never have your fill. You put on clothes, but are not warm. You earn wages, only to put them in a purse with holes in it.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> Almighty says: &#8220;Give careful thought to your ways. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Go up into the mountains and bring down timber and build my house, so that I may take pleasure in it and be honored,&#8221; says the <span class="name">Lord</span>. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;You expected much, but see, it turned out to be little. What you brought home, I blew away. Why?&#8221; declares the <span class="name">Lord</span> Almighty. &#8220;Because of my house, which remains a ruin, while each of you is busy with your own house. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Therefore, because of you the heavens have withheld their dew and the earth its crops. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>I called for a drought on the fields and the mountains, on the grain, the new wine, the olive oil and everything else the ground produces, on people and livestock, and on all the labor of your hands.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, Joshua son of Jozadak, the high priest, and the whole remnant of the people obeyed the voice of the <span class="name">Lord</span> their God and the message of the prophet Haggai, because the <span class="name">Lord</span> their God had sent him.
