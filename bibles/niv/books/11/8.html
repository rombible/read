<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>All the Israelites came together to King Solomon at the time of the festival in the month of Ethanim, the seventh month.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>When all the elders of Israel had arrived, the priests took up the ark, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and they brought up the ark of the <span class="name">Lord</span> and the tent of meeting and all the sacred furnishings in it. The priests and Levites carried them up, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and King Solomon and the entire assembly of Israel that had gathered about him were before the ark, sacrificing so many sheep and cattle that they could not be recorded or counted.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>The priests then brought the ark of the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s covenant to its place in the inner sanctuary of the temple, the Most Holy Place, and put it beneath the wings of the cherubim. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>The cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark and overshadowed the ark and its carrying poles. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>These poles were so long that their ends could be seen from the Holy Place in front of the inner sanctuary, but not from outside the Holy Place; and they are still there today. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>There was nothing in the ark except the two stone tablets that Moses had placed in it at Horeb, where the <span class="name">Lord</span> made a covenant with the Israelites after they came out of Egypt.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>When the priests withdrew from the Holy Place, the cloud filled the temple of the <span class="name">Lord</span>. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And the priests could not perform their service because of the cloud, for the glory of the <span class="name">Lord</span> filled his temple.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then Solomon said, &#8220;The <span class="name">Lord</span> has said that he would dwell in a dark cloud;

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>While the whole assembly of Israel was standing there, the king turned around and blessed them.
