<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah to say, &#8220;May the gods deal with me, be it ever so severely, if by this time tomorrow I do not make your life like that of one of them.&#8221;</p>

 and ran for his life. When he came to Beersheba in Judah, he left his servant there, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>while he himself went a day&#8217;s journey into the wilderness.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then he lay down under the bush and fell asleep.</p><p class="reg">All at once an angel touched him and said, &#8220;Get up and eat.&#8221;

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>He replied, &#8220;I have been very zealous for the <span class="name">Lord</span> God Almighty.
