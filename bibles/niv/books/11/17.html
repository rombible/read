 in Gilead, said to Ahab, &#8220;As the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, lives, whom I serve, there will be neither dew nor rain in the next few years except at my word.&#8221;</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Elijah Fed by Ravens</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then the word of the <span class="name">Lord</span> came to Elijah: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8220;Leave here, turn eastward and hide in the Kerith Ravine, east of the Jordan. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>You will drink from the brook, and I have directed the ravens to supply you with food there.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So he did what the <span class="name">Lord</span> had told him. He went to the Kerith Ravine, east of the Jordan, and stayed there. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>The ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning and bread and meat in the evening, and he drank from the brook.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Elijah and the Widow at Zarephath</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Some time later the brook dried up because there had been no rain in the land. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then the word of the <span class="name">Lord</span> came to him: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;Go at once to Zarephath in the region of Sidon and stay there. I have directed a widow there to supply you with food.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So he went to Zarephath. When he came to the town gate, a widow was there gathering sticks. He called to her and asked, &#8220;Would you bring me a little water in a jar so I may have a drink?&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>As she was going to get it, he called, &#8220;And bring me, please, a piece of bread.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>&#8220;As surely as the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God lives,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have any bread&#8212;only a handful of flour in a jar and a little olive oil in a jug. I am gathering a few sticks to take home and make a meal for myself and my son, that we may eat it&#8212;and die.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Elijah said to her, &#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid. Go home and do as you have said. But first make a small loaf of bread for me from what you have and bring it to me, and then make something for yourself and your son. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For this is what the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, says: &#8216;The jar of flour will not be used up and the jug of oil will not run dry until the day the <span class="name">Lord</span> sends rain on the land.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>She went away and did as Elijah had told her. So there was food every day for Elijah and for the woman and her family. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>For the jar of flour was not used up and the jug of oil did not run dry, in keeping with the word of the <span class="name">Lord</span> spoken by Elijah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Some time later the son of the woman who owned the house became ill. He grew worse and worse, and finally stopped breathing. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>She said to Elijah, &#8220;What do you have against me, man of God? Did you come to remind me of my sin and kill my son?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>&#8220;Give me your son,&#8221; Elijah replied. He took him from her arms, carried him to the upper room where he was staying, and laid him on his bed. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then he cried out to the <span class="name">Lord</span>, &#8220;<span class="name">Lord</span> my God, have you brought tragedy even on this widow I am staying with, by causing her son to die?&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then he stretched himself out on the boy three times and cried out to the <span class="name">Lord</span>, &#8220;<span class="name">Lord</span> my God, let this boy&#8217;s life return to him!&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> heard Elijah&#8217;s cry, and the boy&#8217;s life returned to him, and he lived. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Elijah picked up the child and carried him down from the room into the house. He gave him to his mother and said, &#8220;Look, your son is alive!&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then the woman said to Elijah, &#8220;Now I know that you are a man of God and that the word of the <span class="name">Lord</span> from your mouth is the truth.&#8221;</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><A name="footnotes"></a><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotebot">Or <i>Tishbite, of the settlers</i></span><br><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
