<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and Jeroboam said to his wife, &#8220;Go, disguise yourself, so you won&#8217;t be recognized as the wife of Jeroboam. Then go to Shiloh. Ahijah the prophet is there&#8212;the one who told me I would be king over this people. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Take ten loaves of bread with you, some cakes and a jar of honey, and go to him. He will tell you what will happen to the boy.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So Jeroboam&#8217;s wife did what he said and went to Ahijah&#8217;s house in Shiloh.</p><p class="reg">Now Ahijah could not see; his sight was gone because of his age. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But the <span class="name">Lord</span> had told Ahijah, &#8220;Jeroboam&#8217;s wife is coming to ask you about her son, for he is ill, and you are to give her such and such an answer. When she arrives, she will pretend to be someone else.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So when Ahijah heard the sound of her footsteps at the door, he said, &#8220;Come in, wife of Jeroboam. Why this pretense? I have been sent to you with bad news. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Go, tell Jeroboam that this is what the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, says: &#8216;I raised you up from among the people and appointed you ruler over my people Israel. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>I tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you, but you have not been like my servant David, who kept my commands and followed me with all his heart, doing only what was right in my eyes. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>You have done more evil than all who lived before you. You have made for yourself other gods, idols made of metal; you have aroused my anger and turned your back on me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;Because of this, I am going to bring disaster on the house of Jeroboam. I will cut off from Jeroboam every last male in Israel&#8212;slave or free.
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or Israel--every ruler or leader">a</a></sup></span>
 I will burn up the house of Jeroboam as one burns dung, until it is all gone. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Dogs will eat those belonging to Jeroboam who die in the city, and the birds will feed on those who die in the country. The <span class="name">Lord</span> has spoken!&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>&#8220;As for you, go back home. When you set foot in your city, the boy will die. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>All Israel will mourn for him and bury him. He is the only one belonging to Jeroboam who will be buried, because he is the only one in the house of Jeroboam in whom the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, has found anything good.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>&#8220;The <span class="name">Lord</span> will raise up for himself a king over Israel who will cut off the family of Jeroboam. Even now this is beginning to happen.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And the <span class="name">Lord</span> will strike Israel, so that it will be like a reed swaying in the water. He will uproot Israel from this good land that he gave to their ancestors and scatter them beyond the Euphrates River, because they aroused the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s anger by making Asherah poles.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then Jeroboam&#8217;s wife got up and left and went to Tirzah. As soon as she stepped over the threshold of the house, the boy died.
