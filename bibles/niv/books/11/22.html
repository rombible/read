<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>But in the third year Jehoshaphat king of Judah went down to see the king of Israel. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>The king of Israel had said to his officials, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know that Ramoth Gilead belongs to us and yet we are doing nothing to retake it from the king of Aram?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So he asked Jehoshaphat, &#8220;Will you go with me to fight against Ramoth Gilead?&#8221;</p><p class="reg">Jehoshaphat replied to the king of Israel, &#8220;I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel, &#8220;First seek the counsel of the <span class="name">Lord</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So the king of Israel brought together the prophets&#8212;about four hundred men&#8212;and asked them, &#8220;Shall I go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I refrain?&#8221;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;Go,&#8221; they answered, &#8220;for the Lord will give it into the king&#8217;s hand.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But Jehoshaphat asked, &#8220;Is there no longer a prophet of the <span class="name">Lord</span> here whom we can inquire of?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>The king of Israel answered Jehoshaphat, &#8220;There is still one prophet through whom we can inquire of the <span class="name">Lord</span>, but I hate him because he never prophesies anything good about me, but always bad. He is Micaiah son of Imlah.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;The king should not say such a thing,&#8221; Jehoshaphat replied.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So the king of Israel called one of his officials and said, &#8220;Bring Micaiah son of Imlah at once.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Dressed in their royal robes, the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting on their thrones at the threshing floor by the entrance of the gate of Samaria, with all the prophets prophesying before them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now Zedekiah son of Kenaanah had made iron horns and he declared, &#8220;This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> says: &#8216;With these you will gore the Arameans until they are destroyed.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>All the other prophets were prophesying the same thing. &#8220;Attack Ramoth Gilead and be victorious,&#8221; they said, &#8220;for the <span class="name">Lord</span> will give it into the king&#8217;s hand.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>The messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah said to him, &#8220;Look, the other prophets without exception are predicting success for the king. Let your word agree with theirs, and speak favorably.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But Micaiah said, &#8220;As surely as the <span class="name">Lord</span> lives, I can tell him only what the <span class="name">Lord</span> tells me.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>When he arrived, the king asked him, &#8220;Micaiah, shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or not?&#8221;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;Attack and be victorious,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;for the <span class="name">Lord</span> will give it into the king&#8217;s hand.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>The king said to him, &#8220;How many times must I make you swear to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the <span class="name">Lord</span>?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then Micaiah answered, &#8220;I saw all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd, and the <span class="name">Lord</span> said, &#8216;These people have no master.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell you that he never prophesies anything good about me, but only bad?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Micaiah continued, &#8220;Therefore hear the word of the <span class="name">Lord</span>: I saw the <span class="name">Lord</span> sitting on his throne with all the multitudes of heaven standing around him on his right and on his left. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And the <span class="name">Lord</span> said, &#8216;Who will entice Ahab into attacking Ramoth Gilead and going to his death there?&#8217;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;One suggested this, and another that. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Finally, a spirit came forward, stood before the <span class="name">Lord</span> and said, &#8216;I will entice him.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;By what means?&#8217; the <span class="name">Lord</span> asked.</p><p class="reg">&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;I will go out and be a deceiving spirit in the mouths of all his prophets,&#8217; he said.</p><p class="reg">&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;You will succeed in enticing him,&#8217; said the <span class="name">Lord</span>. &#8216;Go and do it.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>&#8220;So now the <span class="name">Lord</span> has put a deceiving spirit in the mouths of all these prophets of yours.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah went up and slapped Micaiah in the face. &#8220;Which way did the spirit from

 the <span class="name">Lord</span> go when he went from me to speak to you?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Micaiah replied, &#8220;You will find out on the day you go to hide in an inner room.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>The king of Israel then ordered, &#8220;Take Micaiah and send him back to Amon the ruler of the city and to Joash the king&#8217;s son 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>and say, &#8216;This is what the king says: Put this fellow in prison and give him nothing but bread and water until I return safely.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Micaiah declared, &#8220;If you ever return safely, the <span class="name">Lord</span> has not spoken through me.&#8221; Then he added, &#8220;Mark my words, all you people!&#8221;</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Ahab Killed at Ramoth Gilead</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>But someone drew his bow at random and hit the king of Israel between the sections of his armor.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>All day long the battle raged, and the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Arameans. The blood from his wound ran onto the floor of the chariot, and that evening he died.
