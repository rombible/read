<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So his attendants said to him, &#8220;Let us look for a young virgin to serve the king and take care of him. She can lie beside him so that our lord the king may keep warm.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then they searched throughout Israel for a beautiful young woman and found Abishag, a Shunammite, and brought her to the king. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>The woman was very beautiful; she took care of the king and waited on him, but the king had no sexual relations with her.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now Adonijah, whose mother was Haggith, put himself forward and said, &#8220;I will be king.&#8221; So he got chariots and horses

 ready, with fifty men to run ahead of him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>(His father had never rebuked him by asking, &#8220;Why do you behave as you do?&#8221; He was also very handsome and was born next after Absalom.)</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Adonijah conferred with Joab son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest, and they gave him their support. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But Zadok the priest, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei and Rei and David&#8217;s special guard did not join Adonijah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Adonijah then sacrificed sheep, cattle and fattened calves at the Stone of Zoheleth near En Rogel. He invited all his brothers, the king&#8217;s sons, and all the royal officials of Judah, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>but he did not invite Nathan the prophet or Benaiah or the special guard or his brother Solomon.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then Nathan asked Bathsheba, Solomon&#8217;s mother, &#8220;Have you not heard that Adonijah, the son of Haggith, has become king, and our lord David knows nothing about it? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now then, let me advise you how you can save your own life and the life of your son Solomon. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Go in to King David and say to him, &#8216;My lord the king, did you not swear to me your servant: &#8220;Surely Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he will sit on my throne&#8221;? Why then has Adonijah become king?&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>While you are still there talking to the king, I will come in and add my word to what you have said.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So Bathsheba went to see the aged king in his room, where Abishag the Shunammite was attending him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Bathsheba bowed down, prostrating herself before the king.</p><p class="reg">&#8220;What is it you want?&#8221; the king asked.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>But now Adonijah has become king, and you, my lord the king, do not know about it.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>My lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are on you, to learn from you who will sit on the throne of my lord the king after him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Otherwise, as soon as my lord the king is laid to rest with his ancestors, I and my son Solomon will be treated as criminals.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>While she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet arrived. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And the king was told, &#8220;Nathan the prophet is here.&#8221; So he went before the king and bowed with his face to the ground.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Nathan said, &#8220;Have you, my lord the king, declared that Adonijah shall be king after you, and that he will sit on your throne?

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>But me your servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon he did not invite.

<p class="sectionhead">David Makes Solomon King</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then King David said, &#8220;Call in Bathsheba.&#8221; So she came into the king&#8217;s presence and stood before him.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Then Bathsheba bowed down with her face to the ground, prostrating herself before the king, and said, &#8220;May my lord King David live forever!&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>King David said, &#8220;Call in Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet and Benaiah son of Jehoiada.&#8221; When they came before the king,

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Benaiah son of Jehoiada answered the king, &#8220;Amen! May the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the God of my lord the king, so declare it.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Kerethites and the Pelethites went down and had Solomon mount King David&#8217;s mule, and they escorted him to Gihon. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>Zadok the priest took the horn of oil from the sacred tent and anointed Solomon. Then they sounded the trumpet and all the people shouted, &#8220;Long live King Solomon!&#8221;

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>Even as he was speaking, Jonathan son of Abiathar the priest arrived. Adonijah said, &#8220;Come in. A worthy man like you must be bringing good news.&#8221;</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>The king has sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Kerethites and the Pelethites, and they have put him on the king&#8217;s mule,

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-48.htm"><b>48</b></a></span>and said, &#8216;Praise be to the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, who has allowed my eyes to see a successor on my throne today.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-49.htm"><b>49</b></a></span>At this, all Adonijah&#8217;s guests rose in alarm and dispersed.
