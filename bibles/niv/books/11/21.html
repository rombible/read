The vineyard was in Jezreel, close to the palace of Ahab king of Samaria. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Ahab said to Naboth, &#8220;Let me have your vineyard to use for a vegetable garden, since it is close to my palace. In exchange I will give you a better vineyard or, if you prefer, I will pay you whatever it is worth.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But Naboth replied, &#8220;The <span class="name">Lord</span> forbid that I should give you the inheritance of my ancestors.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So Ahab went home, sullen and angry because Naboth the Jezreelite had said, &#8220;I will not give you the inheritance of my ancestors.&#8221; He lay on his bed sulking and refused to eat.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>His wife Jezebel came in and asked him, &#8220;Why are you so sullen? Why won&#8217;t you eat?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>He answered her, &#8220;Because I said to Naboth the Jezreelite, &#8216;Sell me your vineyard; or if you prefer, I will give you another vineyard in its place.&#8217; But he said, &#8216;I will not give you my vineyard.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Jezebel his wife said, &#8220;Is this how you act as king over Israel? Get up and eat! Cheer up. I&#8217;ll get you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So she wrote letters in Ahab&#8217;s name, placed his seal on them, and sent them to the elders and nobles who lived in Naboth&#8217;s city with him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>In those letters she wrote:</p><p class="emb">&#8220;Proclaim a day of fasting and seat Naboth in a prominent place among the people. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>But seat two scoundrels opposite him and have them bring charges that he has cursed both God and the king. Then take him out and stone him to death.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So the elders and nobles who lived in Naboth&#8217;s city did as Jezebel directed in the letters she had written to them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>They proclaimed a fast and seated Naboth in a prominent place among the people. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then two scoundrels came and sat opposite him and brought charges against Naboth before the people, saying, &#8220;Naboth has cursed both God and the king.&#8221; So they took him outside the city and stoned him to death. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then they sent word to Jezebel: &#8220;Naboth has been stoned to death.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>As soon as Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned to death, she said to Ahab, &#8220;Get up and take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite that he refused to sell you. He is no longer alive, but dead.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>When Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, he got up and went down to take possession of Naboth&#8217;s vineyard.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then the word of the <span class="name">Lord</span> came to Elijah the Tishbite: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>&#8220;Go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who rules in Samaria. He is now in Naboth&#8217;s vineyard, where he has gone to take possession of it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Say to him, &#8216;This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> says: Have you not murdered a man and seized his property?&#8217; Then say to him, &#8216;This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> says: In the place where dogs licked up Naboth&#8217;s blood, dogs will lick up your blood&#8212;yes, yours!&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Ahab said to Elijah, &#8220;So you have found me, my enemy!&#8221;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;I have found you,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;because you have sold yourself to do evil in the eyes of the <span class="name">Lord</span>.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>(There was never anyone like Ahab, who sold himself to do evil in the eyes of the <span class="name">Lord</span>, urged on by Jezebel his wife.
