<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew; Septuagint four hundred and fortieth">a</a></sup></span>
 year after the Israelites came out of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon&#8217;s reign over Israel, in the month of Ziv, the second month, he began to build the temple of the <span class="name">Lord</span>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>The temple that King Solomon built for the <span class="name">Lord</span> was sixty cubits long, twenty wide and thirty high.
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, about 90 feet long, 30 feet wide and 45 feet high or about 27 meters long, 9 meters wide and 14 meters high">b</a></sup></span>
 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>The portico at the front of the main hall of the temple extended the width of the temple, that is twenty cubits,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, about 30 feet or about 9 meters; also in verses 16 and 20">c</a></sup></span>
 and projected ten cubits
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, about 15 feet or about 4.5 meters; also in verses 23-26">d</a></sup></span>
 from the front of the temple. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>He made narrow windows high up in the temple walls. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Against the walls of the main hall and inner sanctuary he built a structure around the building, in which there were side rooms. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>The lowest floor was five cubits
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, about 7 1/2 feet or about 2.3 meters; also in verses 10 and 24">e</a></sup></span>
 wide, the middle floor six cubits
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, about 9 feet or about 2.7 meters">f</a></sup></span>
 and the third floor seven.
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, about 11 feet or about 3.2 meters">g</a></sup></span>
 He made offset ledges around the outside of the temple so that nothing would be inserted into the temple walls.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>In building the temple, only blocks dressed at the quarry were used, and no hammer, chisel or any other iron tool was heard at the temple site while it was being built.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>The entrance to the lowest
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Septuagint; Hebrew middle">h</a></sup></span>
 floor was on the south side of the temple; a stairway led up to the middle level and from there to the third. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So he built the temple and completed it, roofing it with beams and cedar planks. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And he built the side rooms all along the temple. The height of each was five cubits, and they were attached to the temple by beams of cedar.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>The word of the <span class="name">Lord</span> came to Solomon: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>&#8220;As for this temple you are building, if you follow my decrees, observe my laws and keep all my commands and obey them, I will fulfill through you the promise I gave to David your father. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And I will live among the Israelites and will not abandon my people Israel.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So Solomon built the temple and completed it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>He lined its interior walls with cedar boards, paneling them from the floor of the temple to the ceiling, and covered the floor of the temple with planks of juniper. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>He partitioned off twenty cubits at the rear of the temple with cedar boards from floor to ceiling to form within the temple an inner sanctuary, the Most Holy Place. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>The main hall in front of this room was forty cubits

 long. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>The inside of the temple was cedar, carved with gourds and open flowers. Everything was cedar; no stone was to be seen.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>He prepared the inner sanctuary within the temple to set the ark of the covenant of the <span class="name">Lord</span> there. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>The inner sanctuary was twenty cubits long, twenty wide and twenty high. He overlaid the inside with pure gold, and he also overlaid the altar of cedar. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Solomon covered the inside of the temple with pure gold, and he extended gold chains across the front of the inner sanctuary, which was overlaid with gold. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So he overlaid the whole interior with gold. He also overlaid with gold the altar that belonged to the inner sanctuary.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>For the inner sanctuary he made a pair of cherubim out of olive wood, each ten cubits high. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>One wing of the first cherub was five cubits long, and the other wing five cubits&#8212;ten cubits from wing tip to wing tip. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>The second cherub also measured ten cubits, for the two cherubim were identical in size and shape. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>The height of each cherub was ten cubits. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>He placed the cherubim inside the innermost room of the temple, with their wings spread out. The wing of one cherub touched one wall, while the wing of the other touched the other wall, and their wings touched each other in the middle of the room. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>He overlaid the cherubim with gold.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>On the walls all around the temple, in both the inner and outer rooms, he carved cherubim, palm trees and open flowers. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>He also covered the floors of both the inner and outer rooms of the temple with gold.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>For the entrance to the inner sanctuary he made doors out of olive wood that were one fifth of the width of the sanctuary. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>And on the two olive-wood doors he carved cherubim, palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid the cherubim and palm trees with hammered gold. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>In the same way, for the entrance to the main hall he made doorframes out of olive wood that were one fourth of the width of the hall. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>He also made two doors out of juniper wood, each having two leaves that turned in sockets. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>He carved cherubim, palm trees and open flowers on them and overlaid them with gold hammered evenly over the carvings.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>And he built the inner courtyard of three courses of dressed stone and one course of trimmed cedar beams.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>The foundation of the temple of the <span class="name">Lord</span> was laid in the fourth year, in the month of Ziv.
