<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>They were from nations about which the <span class="name">Lord</span> had told the Israelites, &#8220;You must not intermarry with them, because they will surely turn your hearts after their gods.&#8221; Nevertheless, Solomon held fast to them in love. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>He had seven hundred wives of royal birth and three hundred concubines, and his wives led him astray. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>As Solomon grew old, his wives turned his heart after other gods, and his heart was not fully devoted to the <span class="name">Lord</span> his God, as the heart of David his father had been. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>He followed Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and Molek the detestable god of the Ammonites. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So Solomon did evil in the eyes of the <span class="name">Lord</span>; he did not follow the <span class="name">Lord</span> completely, as David his father had done.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>On a hill east of Jerusalem, Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the detestable god of Moab, and for Molek the detestable god of the Ammonites. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>He did the same for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and offered sacrifices to their gods.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> became angry with Solomon because his heart had turned away from the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Although he had forbidden Solomon to follow other gods, Solomon did not keep the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s command. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So the <span class="name">Lord</span> said to Solomon, &#8220;Since this is your attitude and you have not kept my covenant and my decrees, which I commanded you, I will most certainly tear the kingdom away from you and give it to one of your subordinates. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Nevertheless, for the sake of David your father, I will not do it during your lifetime. I will tear it out of the hand of your son. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Yet I will not tear the whole kingdom from him, but will give him one tribe for the sake of David my servant and for the sake of Jerusalem, which I have chosen.&#8221;</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Solomon&#8217;s Adversaries</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then the <span class="name">Lord</span> raised up against Solomon an adversary, Hadad the Edomite, from the royal line of Edom. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Earlier when David was fighting with Edom, Joab the commander of the army, who had gone up to bury the dead, had struck down all the men in Edom. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Joab and all the Israelites stayed there for six months, until they had destroyed all the men in Edom. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But Hadad, still only a boy, fled to Egypt with some Edomite officials who had served his father. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>They set out from Midian and went to Paran. Then taking people from Paran with them, they went to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave Hadad a house and land and provided him with food.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Pharaoh was so pleased with Hadad that he gave him a sister of his own wife, Queen Tahpenes, in marriage. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>The sister of Tahpenes bore him a son named Genubath, whom Tahpenes brought up in the royal palace. There Genubath lived with Pharaoh&#8217;s own children.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>While he was in Egypt, Hadad heard that David rested with his ancestors and that Joab the commander of the army was also dead. Then Hadad said to Pharaoh, &#8220;Let me go, that I may return to my own country.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>&#8220;What have you lacked here that you want to go back to your own country?&#8221; Pharaoh asked.</p><p class="reg">&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; Hadad replied, &#8220;but do let me go!&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And God raised up against Solomon another adversary, Rezon son of Eliada, who had fled from his master, Hadadezer king of Zobah. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>When David destroyed Zobah&#8217;s army, Rezon gathered a band of men around him and became their leader; they went to Damascus, where they settled and took control. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Rezon was Israel&#8217;s adversary as long as Solomon lived, adding to the trouble caused by Hadad. So Rezon ruled in Aram and was hostile toward Israel.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Jeroboam Rebels Against Solomon</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Also, Jeroboam son of Nebat rebelled against the king. He was one of Solomon&#8217;s officials, an Ephraimite from Zeredah, and his mother was a widow named Zeruah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Here is the account of how he rebelled against the king: Solomon had built the terraces
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or the Millo">a</a></sup></span>
 and had filled in the gap in the wall of the city of David his father. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Now Jeroboam was a man of standing, and when Solomon saw how well the young man did his work, he put him in charge of the whole labor force of the tribes of Joseph.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>About that time Jeroboam was going out of Jerusalem, and Ahijah the prophet of Shiloh met him on the way, wearing a new cloak. The two of them were alone out in the country, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>and Ahijah took hold of the new cloak he was wearing and tore it into twelve pieces. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Then he said to Jeroboam, &#8220;Take ten pieces for yourself, for this is what the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, says: &#8216;See, I am going to tear the kingdom out of Solomon&#8217;s hand and give you ten tribes. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>But for the sake of my servant David and the city of Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, he will have one tribe. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>I will do this because they have

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;But I will not take the whole kingdom out of Solomon&#8217;s hand; I have made him ruler all the days of his life for the sake of David my servant, whom I chose and who obeyed my commands and decrees. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>I will take the kingdom from his son&#8217;s hands and give you ten tribes. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>I will give one tribe to his son so that David my servant may always have a lamp before me in Jerusalem, the city where I chose to put my Name. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>However, as for you, I will take you, and you will rule over all that your heart desires; you will be king over Israel. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>If you do whatever I command you and walk in obedience to me and do what is right in my eyes by obeying my decrees and commands, as David my servant did, I will be with you.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>I will humble David&#8217;s descendants because of this, but not forever.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>Solomon tried to kill Jeroboam, but Jeroboam fled to Egypt, to Shishak the king, and stayed there until Solomon&#8217;s death.</p>
