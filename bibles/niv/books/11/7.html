<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>He built the throne hall, the Hall of Justice, where he was to judge, and he covered it with cedar from floor to ceiling.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>All these structures, from the outside to the great courtyard and from foundation to eaves, were made of blocks of high-grade stone cut to size and smoothed on their inner and outer faces. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>The foundations were laid with large stones of good quality, some measuring ten cubits

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Below the rim, gourds encircled it&#8212;ten to a cubit. The gourds were cast in two rows in one piece with the Sea.</p>

 deep. The supports and panels were attached to the top of the stand.
