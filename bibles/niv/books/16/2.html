I had not been sad in his presence before, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>so the king asked me, &#8220;Why does your face look so sad when you are not ill? This can be nothing but sadness of heart.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">I was very much afraid, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>but I said to the king, &#8220;May the king live forever! Why should my face not look sad when the city where my ancestors are buried lies in ruins, and its gates have been destroyed by fire?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>The king said to me, &#8220;What is it you want?&#8221;</p><p class="reg">Then I prayed to the God of heaven, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and I answered the king, &#8220;If it pleases the king and if your servant has found favor in his sight, let him send me to the city in Judah where my ancestors are buried so that I can rebuild it.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then the king, with the queen sitting beside him, asked me, &#8220;How long will your journey take, and when will you get back?&#8221; It pleased the king to send me; so I set a time.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>I also said to him, &#8220;If it pleases the king, may I have letters to the governors of Trans-Euphrates, so that they will provide me safe-conduct until I arrive in Judah? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And may I have a letter to Asaph, keeper of the royal park, so he will give me timber to make beams for the gates of the citadel by the temple and for the city wall and for the residence I will occupy?&#8221; And because the gracious hand of my God was on me, the king granted my requests. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So I went to the governors of Trans-Euphrates and gave them the king&#8217;s letters. The king had also sent army officers and cavalry with me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard about this, they were very much disturbed that someone had come to promote the welfare of the Israelites.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Nehemiah Inspects Jerusalem&#8217;s Walls</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>I went to Jerusalem, and after staying there three days 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>I set out during the night with a few others. I had not told anyone what my God had put in my heart to do for Jerusalem. There were no mounts with me except the one I was riding on.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>By night I went out through the Valley Gate toward the Jackal
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or Serpent or Fig">a</a></sup></span>
 Well and the Dung Gate, examining the walls of Jerusalem, which had been broken down, and its gates, which had been destroyed by fire. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then I moved on toward the Fountain Gate and the King&#8217;s Pool, but there was not enough room for my mount to get through; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>so I went up the valley by night, examining the wall. Finally, I turned back and reentered through the Valley Gate. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>The officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing, because as yet I had said nothing to the Jews or the priests or nobles or officials or any others who would be doing the work.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then I said to them, &#8220;You see the trouble we are in: Jerusalem lies in ruins, and its gates have been burned with fire. Come, let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem, and we will no longer be in disgrace.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>I also told them about the gracious hand of my God on me and what the king had said to me.</p><p class="reg">They replied, &#8220;Let us start rebuilding.&#8221; So they began this good work.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official and Geshem the Arab heard about it, they mocked and ridiculed us. &#8220;What is this you are doing?&#8221; they asked. &#8220;Are you rebelling against the king?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>I answered them by saying, &#8220;The God of heaven will give us success. We his servants will start rebuilding, but as for you, you have no share in Jerusalem or any claim or historic right to it.&#8221;</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><A name="footnotes"></a><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotebot">Or <i>Serpent</i> or <i>Fig</i></span><br><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
