<div class="chap"><p class="sectionhead">Further Opposition to the Rebuilding</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>When word came to Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab and the rest of our enemies that I had rebuilt the wall and not a gap was left in it&#8212;though up to that time I had not set the doors in the gates&#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Sanballat and Geshem sent me this message: &#8220;Come, let us meet together in one of the villages
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or in Kephirim">a</a></sup></span>
 on the plain of Ono.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">But they were scheming to harm me; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>so I sent messengers to them with this reply: &#8220;I am carrying on a great project and cannot go down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and go down to you?&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Four times they sent me the same message, and each time I gave them the same answer.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then, the fifth time, Sanballat sent his aide to me with the same message, and in his hand was an unsealed letter 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>in which was written:</p><p class="emb">&#8220;It is reported among the nations&#8212;and Geshem
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew Gashmu, a variant of Geshem">b</a></sup></span>
 says it is true&#8212;that you and the Jews are plotting to revolt, and therefore you are building the wall. Moreover, according to these reports you are about to become their king 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and have even appointed prophets to make this proclamation about you in Jerusalem: &#8216;There is a king in Judah!&#8217; Now this report will get back to the king; so come, let us meet together.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>I sent him this reply: &#8220;Nothing like what you are saying is happening; you are just making it up out of your head.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>They were all trying to frighten us, thinking, &#8220;Their hands will get too weak for the work, and it will not be completed.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">But I prayed, &#8220;Now strengthen my hands.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>One day I went to the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, who was shut in at his home. He said, &#8220;Let us meet in the house of God, inside the temple, and let us close the temple doors, because men are coming to kill you&#8212;by night they are coming to kill you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But I said, &#8220;Should a man like me run away? Or should someone like me go into the temple to save his life? I will not go!&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>I realized that God had not sent him, but that he had prophesied against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>He had been hired to intimidate me so that I would commit a sin by doing this, and then they would give me a bad name to discredit me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Remember Tobiah and Sanballat, my God, because of what they have done; remember also the prophet Noadiah and how she and the rest of the prophets have been trying to intimidate me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So the wall was completed on the twenty-fifth of Elul, in fifty-two days.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Opposition to the Completed Wall</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>When all our enemies heard about this, all the surrounding nations were afraid and lost their self-confidence, because they realized that this work had been done with the help of our God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Also, in those days the nobles of Judah were sending many letters to Tobiah, and replies from Tobiah kept coming to them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>For many in Judah were under oath to him, since he was son-in-law to Shekaniah son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berekiah. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Moreover, they kept reporting to me his good deeds and then telling him what I said. And Tobiah sent letters to intimidate me.</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><A name="footnotes"></a><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotebot">Or <i>in Kephirim</i></span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotebot">Hebrew <i>Gashmu,</i> a variant of <i>Geshem</i></span><br><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
