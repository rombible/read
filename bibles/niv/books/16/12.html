<p class="sectionhead">Dedication of the Wall of Jerusalem</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, the Levites were sought out from where they lived and were brought to Jerusalem to celebrate joyfully the dedication with songs of thanksgiving and with the music of cymbals, harps and lyres. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>The musicians also were brought together from the region around Jerusalem&#8212;from the villages of the Netophathites, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>from Beth Gilgal, and from the area of Geba and Azmaveth, for the musicians had built villages for themselves around Jerusalem. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>When the priests and Levites had purified themselves ceremonially, they purified the people, the gates and the wall.</p>

 the wall. I also assigned two large choirs to give thanks. One was to proceed on top of
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or proceed alongside">f</a></sup></span>
 the wall to the right, toward the Dung Gate. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Hoshaiah and half the leaders of Judah followed them, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>along with Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>as well as some priests with trumpets, and also Zechariah son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zakkur, the son of Asaph, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>and his associates&#8212;Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah and Hanani&#8212;with musical instruments prescribed by David the man of God. Ezra the teacher of the Law led the procession. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>At the Fountain Gate they continued directly up the steps of the City of David on the ascent to the wall and passed above the site of David&#8217;s palace to the Water Gate on the east.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>The second choir proceeded in the opposite direction. I followed them on top of

 the wall, together with half the people&#8212;past the Tower of the Ovens to the Broad Wall, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>over the Gate of Ephraim, the Jeshanah
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or Old">h</a></sup></span>
 Gate, the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel and the Tower of the Hundred, as far as the Sheep Gate. At the Gate of the Guard they stopped.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>The two choirs that gave thanks then took their places in the house of God; so did I, together with half the officials, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>as well as the priests&#8212;Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah and Hananiah with their trumpets&#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>and also Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malkijah, Elam and Ezer. The choirs sang under the direction of Jezrahiah. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>And on that day they offered great sacrifices, rejoicing because God had given them great joy. The women and children also rejoiced. The sound of rejoicing in Jerusalem could be heard far away.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>At that time men were appointed to be in charge of the storerooms for the contributions, firstfruits and tithes. From the fields around the towns they were to bring into the storerooms the portions required by the Law for the priests and the Levites, for Judah was pleased with the ministering priests and Levites. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>They performed the service of their God and the service of purification, as did also the musicians and gatekeepers, according to the commands of David and his son Solomon. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span>For long ago, in the days of David and Asaph, there had been directors for the musicians and for the songs of praise and thanksgiving to God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-47.htm"><b>47</b></a></span>So in the days of Zerubbabel and of Nehemiah, all Israel contributed the daily portions for the musicians and the gatekeepers.
