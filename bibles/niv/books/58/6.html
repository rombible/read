 the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.

 away, to be brought back to repentance. To their loss they are crucifying the Son of God all over again and subjecting him to public disgrace.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But land that produces thorns and thistles is worthless and is in danger of being cursed. In the end it will be burned.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Even though we speak like this, dear friends, we are convinced of better things in your case&#8212;the things that have to do with salvation. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>God is not unjust; he will not forget your work and the love you have shown him as you have helped his people and continue to help them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>We want each of you to show this same diligence to the very end, so that what you hope for may be fully realized.

<p class="sectionhead">The Certainty of God&#8217;s Promise</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>When God made his promise to Abraham, since there was no one greater for him to swear by, he swore by himself, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>saying, &#8220;I will surely bless you and give you many descendants.&#8221;

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Because God wanted to make the unchanging nature of his purpose very clear to the heirs of what was promised, he confirmed it with an oath. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>God did this so that, by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled to take hold of the hope set before us may be greatly encouraged. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure. It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain,
