<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>For since the message spoken through angels was binding, and every violation and disobedience received its just punishment, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>how shall we escape if we ignore so great a salvation? This salvation, which was first announced by the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>God also testified to it by signs, wonders and various miracles, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will.</p>
