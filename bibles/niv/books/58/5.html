<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>This is why he has to offer sacrifices for his own sins, as well as for the sins of the people.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Son though he was, he learned obedience from what he suffered 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and, once made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him
