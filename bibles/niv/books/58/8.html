<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and who serves in the sanctuary, the true tabernacle set up by the Lord, not by a mere human being.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices, and so it was necessary for this one also to have something to offer. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>If he were on earth, he would not be a priest, for there are already priests who offer the gifts prescribed by the law. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>They serve at a sanctuary that is a copy and shadow of what is in heaven. This is why Moses was warned when he was about to build the tabernacle: &#8220;See to it that you make everything according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.&#8221;

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But in fact the ministry Jesus has received is as superior to theirs as the covenant of which he is mediator is superior to the old one, since the new covenant is established on better promises.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For if there had been nothing wrong with that first covenant, no place would have been sought for another.
