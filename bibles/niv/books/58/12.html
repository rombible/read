And let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Consider him who endured such opposition from sinners, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">God Disciplines His Children</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>In your struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And have you completely forgotten this word of encouragement that addresses you as a father addresses his son? It says,</p><div class="stanza"><p class="line1">&#8220;My son, do not make light of the Lord&#8217;s discipline,</p><p class="line2">and do not lose heart when he rebukes you,</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>because the Lord disciplines the one he loves,</p><p class="line2">and he chastens everyone he accepts as his son.&#8221;

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Endure hardship as discipline; God is treating you as his children. For what children are not disciplined by their father? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>If you are not disciplined&#8212;and everyone undergoes discipline&#8212;then you are not legitimate, not true sons and daughters at all. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Moreover, we have all had human fathers who disciplined us and we respected them for it. How much more should we submit to the Father of spirits and live! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>They disciplined us for a little while as they thought best; but God disciplines us for our good, in order that we may share in his holiness. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Therefore, strengthen your feeble arms and weak knees. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8220;Make level paths for your feet,&#8221;
