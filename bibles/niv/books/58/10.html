For this reason it can never, by the same sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year, make perfect those who draw near to worship. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Otherwise, would they not have stopped being offered? For the worshipers would have been cleansed once for all, and would no longer have felt guilty for their sins. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But those sacrifices are an annual reminder of sins. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>It is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Therefore, when Christ came into the world, he said:</p><div class="stanza"><p class="line1">&#8220;Sacrifice and offering you did not desire,</p><p class="line2">but a body you prepared for me;</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>with burnt offerings and sin offerings</p><p class="line2">you were not pleased.</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then I said, &#8216;Here I am&#8212;it is written about me in the scroll&#8212;</p><p class="line2">I have come to do your will, my God.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Psalm 40:6-8 (see Septuagint)">a</a></sup></span>
</p></div>
<p class="pcontinued"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>First he said, &#8220;Sacrifices and offerings, burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not desire, nor were you pleased with them&#8221;&#8212;though they were offered in accordance with the law. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then he said, &#8220;Here I am, I have come to do your will.&#8221; He sets aside the first to establish the second. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And by that will, we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Day after day every priest stands and performs his religious duties; again and again he offers the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But when this priest had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>and since that time he waits for his enemies to be made his footstool. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being made holy.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>The Holy Spirit also testifies to us about this. First he says:</p>
<div class="stanza"><p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>&#8220;This is the covenant I will make with them</p><p class="line2">after that time, says the Lord.</p><p class="line1">I will put my laws in their hearts,</p><p class="line2">and I will write them on their minds.&#8221;
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Jer. 31:33">b</a></sup></span>
</p></div>
<p class="pcontinued"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then he adds:</p><div class="stanza"><p class="line1">&#8220;Their sins and lawless acts</p><p class="line2">I will remember no more.&#8221;
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Jer. 31:34">c</a></sup></span>
</p></div>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And where these have been forgiven, sacrifice for sin is no longer necessary.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">A Call to Persevere in Faith</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Therefore, brothers and sisters, since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>by a new and living way opened for us through the curtain, that is, his body, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>and since we have a great priest over the house of God, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>let us draw near to God with a sincere heart and with the full assurance that faith brings, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another&#8212;and all the more as you see the Day approaching.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice for sins is left, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Anyone who rejected the law of Moses died without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>How much more severely do you think someone deserves to be punished who has trampled the Son of God underfoot, who has treated as an unholy thing the blood of the covenant that sanctified them, and who has insulted the Spirit of grace? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>For we know him who said, &#8220;It is mine to avenge; I will repay,&#8221;
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Deut. 32:35">d</a></sup></span>
 and again, &#8220;The Lord will judge his people.&#8221;
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Deut. 32:36; Psalm 135:14">e</a></sup></span>
 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Remember those earlier days after you had received the light, when you endured in a great conflict full of suffering. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Sometimes you were publicly exposed to insult and persecution; at other times you stood side by side with those who were so treated. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>You suffered along with those in prison and joyfully accepted the confiscation of your property, because you knew that you yourselves had better and lasting possessions. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>So do not throw away your confidence; it will be richly rewarded.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>You need to persevere so that when you have done the will of God, you will receive what he has promised.
