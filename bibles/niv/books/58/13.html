<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Do not forget to show hospitality to strangers, for by so doing some people have shown hospitality to angels without knowing it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Continue to remember those in prison as if you were together with them in prison, and those who are mistreated as if you yourselves were suffering.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said,</p><div class="stanza"><p class="line1">&#8220;Never will I leave you;</p><p class="line2">never will I forsake you.&#8221;
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Deut. 31:6">a</a></sup></span>

<p class="pcontinued"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So we say with confidence,</p><div class="stanza"><p class="line1">&#8220;The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid.</p><p class="line2">What can mere mortals do to me?&#8221;
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Psalm 118:6,7">b</a></sup></span>
</p></div>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Remember your leaders, who spoke the word of God to you. Consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Do not be carried away by all kinds of strange teachings. It is good for our hearts to be strengthened by grace, not by eating ceremonial foods, which is of no benefit to those who do so. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>We have an altar from which those who minister at the tabernacle have no right to eat.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>The high priest carries the blood of animals into the Most Holy Place as a sin offering, but the bodies are burned outside the camp. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And so Jesus also suffered outside the city gate to make the people holy through his own blood. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Let us, then, go to him outside the camp, bearing the disgrace he bore. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For here we do not have an enduring city, but we are looking for the city that is to come.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Through Jesus, therefore, let us continually offer to God a sacrifice of praise&#8212;the fruit of lips that openly profess his name. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And do not forget to do good and to share with others, for with such sacrifices God is pleased.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Have confidence in your leaders and submit to their authority, because they keep watch over you as those who must give an account. Do this so that their work will be a joy, not a burden, for that would be of no benefit to you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Pray for us. We are sure that we have a clear conscience and desire to live honorably in every way. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>I particularly urge you to pray so that I may be restored to you soon.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Benediction and Final Greetings</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Now may the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>equip you with everything good for doing his will, and may he work in us what is pleasing to him, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Brothers and sisters, I urge you to bear with my word of exhortation, for in fact I have written to you quite briefly.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>I want you to know that our brother Timothy has been released. If he arrives soon, I will come with him to see you.</p>
