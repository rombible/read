<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>He was faithful to the one who appointed him, just as Moses was faithful in all God&#8217;s house. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Jesus has been found worthy of greater honor than Moses, just as the builder of a house has greater honor than the house itself. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For every house is built by someone, but God is the builder of everything. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8220;Moses was faithful as a servant in all God&#8217;s house,&#8221;

 bearing witness to what would be spoken by God in the future. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But Christ is faithful as the Son over God&#8217;s house. And we are his house, if indeed we hold firmly to our confidence and the hope in which we glory.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Warning Against Unbelief</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So, as the Holy Spirit says:</p><div class="stanza"><p class="line1">&#8220;Today, if you hear his voice,</p>
<p class="line2"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>do not harden your hearts</p><p class="line1">as you did in the rebellion,</p><p class="line2">during the time of testing in the wilderness,</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>where your ancestors tested and tried me,</p><p class="line2">though for forty years they saw what I did.</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>That is why I was angry with that generation;</p><p class="line2">I said, &#8216;Their hearts are always going astray,</p><p class="line2">and they have not known my ways.&#8217;</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So I declared on oath in my anger,</p><p class="line2">&#8216;They shall never enter my rest.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called &#8220;Today,&#8221; so that none of you may be hardened by sin&#8217;s deceitfulness. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>We have come to share in Christ, if indeed we hold our original conviction firmly to the very end.
