<div class="chap"><p class="sectionhead">Closing Appeal for Steadfastness and Unity</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/4-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Therefore, my brothers and sisters, you whom I love and long for, my joy and crown, stand firm in the Lord in this way, dear friends!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>I plead with Euodia and I plead with Syntyche to be of the same mind in the Lord. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Yes, and I ask you, my true companion, help these women since they have contended at my side in the cause of the gospel, along with Clement and the rest of my co-workers, whose names are in the book of life.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Final Exhortations</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Let your gentleness be evident to all. The Lord is near. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable&#8212;if anything is excellent or praiseworthy&#8212;think about such things. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me&#8212;put it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Thanks for Their Gifts</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>I rejoiced greatly in the Lord that at last you renewed your concern for me. Indeed, you were concerned, but you had no opportunity to show it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>I can do all this through him who gives me strength.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/4-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Yet it was good of you to share in my troubles. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/4-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Moreover, as you Philippians know, in the early days of your acquaintance with the gospel, when I set out from Macedonia, not one church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving, except you only; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/4-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>for even when I was in Thessalonica, you sent me aid more than once when I was in need. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/4-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Not that I desire your gifts; what I desire is that more be credited to your account. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/4-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>I have received full payment and have more than enough. I am amply supplied, now that I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent. They are a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/4-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And my God will meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/4-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>To our God and Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Final Greetings</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/4-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Greet all God&#8217;s people in Christ Jesus. The brothers and sisters who are with me send greetings. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/4-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>All God&#8217;s people here send you greetings, especially those who belong to Caesar&#8217;s household.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/4-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
