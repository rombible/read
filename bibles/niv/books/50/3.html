It is no trouble for me to write the same things to you again, and it is a safeguard for you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Watch out for those dogs, those evildoers, those mutilators of the flesh. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For it is we who are the circumcision, we who serve God by his Spirit, who boast in Christ Jesus, and who put no confidence in the flesh&#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>though I myself have reasons for such confidence.</p><p class="reg">If someone else thinks they have reasons to put confidence in the flesh, I have more: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; in regard to the law, a Pharisee; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>as for zeal, persecuting the church; as for righteousness based on the law, faultless.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But whatever were gains to me I now consider loss for the sake of Christ. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>What is more, I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them garbage, that I may gain Christ 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or through the faithfulness of">a</a></sup></span>
 Christ&#8212;the righteousness that comes from God on the basis of faith. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>I want to know Christ&#8212;yes, to know the power of his resurrection and participation in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>and so, somehow, attaining to the resurrection from the dead.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already arrived at my goal, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Following Paul&#8217;s Example</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>All of us, then, who are mature should take such a view of things.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Only let us live up to what we have already attained.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Join together in following my example, brothers and sisters, and just as you have us as a model, keep your eyes on those who live as we do. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>For, as I have often told you before and now tell you again even with tears, many live as enemies of the cross of Christ. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Their destiny is destruction, their god is their stomach, and their glory is in their shame. Their mind is set on earthly things. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>But our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ,
