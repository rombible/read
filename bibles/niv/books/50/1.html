<p class="opening"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Thanksgiving and Prayer</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>I thank my God every time I remember you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>In all my prayers for all of you, I always pray with joy 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>It is right for me to feel this way about all of you, since I have you in my heart and, whether I am in chains or defending and confirming the gospel, all of you share in God&#8217;s grace with me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>God can testify how I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>so that you may be able to discern what is best and may be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ&#8212;to the glory and praise of God.</p>

 that what has happened to me has actually served to advance the gospel. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>As a result, it has become clear throughout the whole palace guard
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or whole palace">c</a></sup></span>
 and to everyone else that I am in chains for Christ. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And because of my chains, most of the brothers and sisters have become confident in the Lord and dare all the more to proclaim the gospel without fear.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others out of goodwill. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>The latter do so out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing that they can stir up trouble for me while I am in chains. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>But what does it matter? The important thing is that in every way, whether from false motives or true, Christ is preached. And because of this I rejoice.</p><p class="reg">Yes, and I will continue to rejoice, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>for I know that through your prayers and God&#8217;s provision of the Spirit of Jesus Christ what has happened to me will turn out for my deliverance.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>I eagerly expect and hope that I will in no way be ashamed, but will have sufficient courage so that now as always Christ will be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>If I am to go on living in the body, this will mean fruitful labor for me. Yet what shall I choose? I do not know! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>I am torn between the two: I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>but it is more necessary for you that I remain in the body. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Convinced of this, I know that I will remain, and I will continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>so that through my being with you again your boasting in Christ Jesus will abound on account of me.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Life Worthy of the Gospel</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Whatever happens, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ.
