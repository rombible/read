<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being one in spirit and of one mind. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus:</p>
<div class="stanza"><p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Who, being in very nature
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or in the form of">a</a></sup></span>
 God,</p><p class="line2">did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage;</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>rather, he made himself nothing</p><p class="line2">by taking the very nature
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or the form">b</a></sup></span>
 of a servant,</p><p class="line2">being made in human likeness.</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And being found in appearance as a man,</p><p class="line2">he humbled himself</p><p class="line2">by becoming obedient to death&#8212;</p><p class="line3">even death on a cross!</p></div>
<div class="stanza"><p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Therefore God exalted him to the highest place</p><p class="line2">and gave him the name that is above every name,</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow,</p><p class="line2">in heaven and on earth and under the earth,</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord,</p><p class="line2">to the glory of God the Father.</p></div>
<p class="sectionhead">Do Everything Without Grumbling</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always obeyed&#8212;not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence&#8212;continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>for it is God who works in you to will and to act in order to fulfill his good purpose.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Do everything without grumbling or arguing, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>so that you may become blameless and pure, &#8220;children of God without fault in a warped and crooked generation.&#8221;
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Deut. 32:5">c</a></sup></span>
 Then you will shine among them like stars in the sky 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>as you hold firmly to the word of life. And then I will be able to boast on the day of Christ that I did not run or labor in vain. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But even if I am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and service coming from your faith, I am glad and rejoice with all of you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>So you too should be glad and rejoice with me.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Timothy and Epaphroditus</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be cheered when I receive news about you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>I have no one else like him, who will show genuine concern for your welfare. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>For everyone looks out for their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But you know that Timothy has proved himself, because as a son with his father he has served with me in the work of the gospel. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>I hope, therefore, to send him as soon as I see how things go with me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And I am confident in the Lord that I myself will come soon.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>But I think it is necessary to send back to you Epaphroditus, my brother, co-worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger, whom you sent to take care of my needs. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>For he longs for all of you and is distressed because you heard he was ill. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Indeed he was ill, and almost died. But God had mercy on him, and not on him only but also on me, to spare me sorrow upon sorrow. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Therefore I am all the more eager to send him, so that when you see him again you may be glad and I may have less anxiety. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>So then, welcome him in the Lord with great joy, and honor people like him, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>because he almost died for the work of Christ. He risked his life to make up for the help you yourselves could not give me.</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><A name="footnotes"></a><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotebot">Or <i>in the form of</i></span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotebot">Or <i>the form</i></span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">c</span> <span class="fnverse">15</span> <span class="footnotebot">Deut.&#8239;32:5</span><br><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
