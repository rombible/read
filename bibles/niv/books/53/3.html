 you received from us. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example. We were not idle when we were with you, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>nor did we eat anyone&#8217;s food without paying for it. On the contrary, we worked night and day, laboring and toiling so that we would not be a burden to any of you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>We did this, not because we do not have the right to such help, but in order to offer ourselves as a model for you to imitate.
