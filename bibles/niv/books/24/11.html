<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Listen to the terms of this covenant and tell them to the people of Judah and to those who live in Jerusalem. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Tell them that this is what the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, says: &#8216;Cursed is the one who does not obey the terms of this covenant&#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>the terms I commanded your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt, out of the iron-smelting furnace.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Obey me and do everything I command you, and you will be my people, and I will be your God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then I will fulfill the oath I swore to your ancestors, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey&#8217;&#8212;the land you possess today.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">I answered, &#8220;Amen, <span class="name">Lord</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> said to me, &#8220;Proclaim all these words in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem: &#8216;Listen to the terms of this covenant and follow them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>From the time I brought your ancestors up from Egypt until today, I warned them again and again, saying, &#8220;Obey me.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But they did not listen or pay attention; instead, they followed the stubbornness of their evil hearts. So I brought on them all the curses of the covenant I had commanded them to follow but that they did not keep.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then the <span class="name">Lord</span> said to me, &#8220;There is a conspiracy among the people of Judah and those who live in Jerusalem. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>They have returned to the sins of their ancestors, who refused to listen to my words. They have followed other gods to serve them. Both Israel and Judah have broken the covenant I made with their ancestors. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Therefore this is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> says: &#8216;I will bring on them a disaster they cannot escape. Although they cry out to me, I will not listen to them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>The towns of Judah and the people of Jerusalem will go and cry out to the gods to whom they burn incense, but they will not help them at all when disaster strikes. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>You, Judah, have as many gods as you have towns; and the altars you have set up to burn incense to that shameful god Baal are as many as the streets of Jerusalem.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>&#8220;Do not pray for this people or offer any plea or petition for them, because I will not listen when they call to me in the time of their distress.</p>
