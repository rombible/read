 son of Josiah king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the <span class="name">Lord</span>: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> said to me: &#8220;Make a yoke out of straps and crossbars and put it on your neck. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then send word to the kings of Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre and Sidon through the envoys who have come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Give them a message for their masters and say, &#8216;This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> Almighty, the God of Israel, says: &#8220;Tell this to your masters: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>With my great power and outstretched arm I made the earth and its people and the animals that are on it, and I give it to anyone I please. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now I will give all your countries into the hands of my servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; I will make even the wild animals subject to him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>All nations will serve him and his son and his grandson until the time for his land comes; then many nations and great kings will subjugate him.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So do not listen to your prophets, your diviners, your interpreters of dreams, your mediums or your sorcerers who tell you, &#8216;You will not serve the king of Babylon.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>They prophesy lies to you that will only serve to remove you far from your lands; I will banish you and you will perish. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But if any nation will bow its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, I will let that nation remain in its own land to till it and to live there, declares the <span class="name">Lord</span>.&#8221;&#8239;&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>I gave the same message to Zedekiah king of Judah. I said, &#8220;Bow your neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon; serve him and his people, and you will live. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Why will you and your people die by the sword, famine and plague with which the <span class="name">Lord</span> has threatened any nation that will not serve the king of Babylon? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Do not listen to the words of the prophets who say to you, &#8216;You will not serve the king of Babylon,&#8217; for they are prophesying lies to you.
