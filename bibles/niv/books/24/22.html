<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8216;Hear the word of the <span class="name">Lord</span> to you, king of Judah, you who sit on David&#8217;s throne&#8212;you, your officials and your people who come through these gates. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> says: Do what is just and right. Rescue from the hand of the oppressor the one who has been robbed. Do no wrong or violence to the foreigner, the fatherless or the widow, and do not shed innocent blood in this place. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For if you are careful to carry out these commands, then kings who sit on David&#8217;s throne will come through the gates of this palace, riding in chariots and on horses, accompanied by their officials and their people.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And the answer will be: &#8216;Because they have forsaken the covenant of the <span class="name">Lord</span> their God and have worshiped and served other gods.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
