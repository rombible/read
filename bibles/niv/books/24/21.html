They said: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Inquire now of the <span class="name">Lord</span> for us because Nebuchadnezzar
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew Nebuchadrezzar, of which Nebuchadnezzar is a variant; here and often in Jeremiah and Ezekiel">a</a></sup></span>
 king of Babylon is attacking us. Perhaps the <span class="name">Lord</span> will perform wonders for us as in times past so that he will withdraw from us.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But Jeremiah answered them, &#8220;Tell Zedekiah, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8216;This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, says: I am about to turn against you the weapons of war that are in your hands, which you are using to fight the king of Babylon and the Babylonians
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or Chaldeans; also in verse 9">b</a></sup></span>
 who are outside the wall besieging you. And I will gather them inside this city. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and a mighty arm in furious anger and in great wrath. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>I will strike down those who live in this city&#8212;both man and beast&#8212;and they will die of a terrible plague. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>After that, declares the <span class="name">Lord</span>, I will give Zedekiah king of Judah, his officials and the people in this city who survive the plague, sword and famine, into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and to their enemies who want to kill them. He will put them to the sword; he will show them no mercy or pity or compassion.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8220;Furthermore, tell the people, &#8216;This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> says: See, I am setting before you the way of life and the way of death. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Whoever stays in this city will die by the sword, famine or plague. But whoever goes out and surrenders to the Babylonians who are besieging you will live; they will escape with their lives. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>I have determined to do this city harm and not good, declares the <span class="name">Lord</span>. It will be given into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he will destroy it with fire.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8220;Moreover, say to the royal house of Judah, &#8216;Hear the word of the <span class="name">Lord</span>.
