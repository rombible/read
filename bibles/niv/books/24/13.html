<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So I bought a belt, as the <span class="name">Lord</span> directed, and put it around my waist.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then the word of the <span class="name">Lord</span> came to me a second time: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8220;Take the belt you bought and are wearing around your waist, and go now to Perath
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or possibly to the Euphrates; similarly in verses 5-7">a</a></sup></span>
 and hide it there in a crevice in the rocks.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So I went and hid it at Perath, as the <span class="name">Lord</span> told me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Many days later the <span class="name">Lord</span> said to me, &#8220;Go now to Perath and get the belt I told you to hide there.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So I went to Perath and dug up the belt and took it from the place where I had hidden it, but now it was ruined and completely useless.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For as a belt is bound around the waist, so I bound all the people of Israel and all the people of Judah to me,&#8217; declares the <span class="name">Lord</span>, &#8216;to be my people for my renown and praise and honor.
