<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Jeremiah the prophet and said to him, &#8220;Please hear our petition and pray to the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God for this entire remnant. For as you now see, though we were once many, now only a few are left. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Pray that the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God will tell us where we should go and what we should do.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8220;I have heard you,&#8221; replied Jeremiah the prophet. &#8220;I will certainly pray to the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God as you have requested; I will tell you everything the <span class="name">Lord</span> says and will keep nothing back from you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then they said to Jeremiah, &#8220;May the <span class="name">Lord</span> be a true and faithful witness against us if we do not act in accordance with everything the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God sends you to tell us. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Whether it is favorable or unfavorable, we will obey the <span class="name">Lord</span> our God, to whom we are sending you, so that it will go well with us, for we will obey the <span class="name">Lord</span> our God.&#8221;</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>He said to them, &#8220;This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your petition, says: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8216;If you stay in this land, I will build you up and not tear you down; I will plant you and not uproot you, for I have relented concerning the disaster I have inflicted on you.
