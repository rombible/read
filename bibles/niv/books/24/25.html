<div class="chap"><p class="sectionhead">Seventy Years of Captivity</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>The word came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, which was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So Jeremiah the prophet said to all the people of Judah and to all those living in Jerusalem: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For twenty-three years&#8212;from the thirteenth year of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah until this very day&#8212;the word of the <span class="name">Lord</span> has come to me and I have spoken to you again and again, but you have not listened.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And though the <span class="name">Lord</span> has sent all his servants the prophets to you again and again, you have not listened or paid any attention. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>They said, &#8220;Turn now, each of you, from your evil ways and your evil practices, and you can stay in the land the <span class="name">Lord</span> gave to you and your ancestors for ever and ever. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Do not follow other gods to serve and worship them; do not arouse my anger with what your hands have made. Then I will not harm you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8220;But you did not listen to me,&#8221; declares the <span class="name">Lord</span>, &#8220;and you have aroused my anger with what your hands have made, and you have brought harm to yourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Therefore the <span class="name">Lord</span> Almighty says this: &#8220;Because you have not listened to my words,

 them and make them an object of horror and scorn, and an everlasting ruin. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>I will banish from them the sounds of joy and gladness, the voices of bride and bridegroom, the sound of millstones and the light of the lamp. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>This whole country will become a desolate wasteland, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon seventy years.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>&#8220;But when the seventy years are fulfilled, I will punish the king of Babylon and his nation, the land of the Babylonians,

 for their guilt,&#8221; declares the <span class="name">Lord</span>, &#8220;and will make it desolate forever. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>I will bring on that land all the things I have spoken against it, all that are written in this book and prophesied by Jeremiah against all the nations.
