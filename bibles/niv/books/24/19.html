 the plans of Judah and Jerusalem. I will make them fall by the sword before their enemies, at the hands of those who want to kill them, and I will give their carcasses as food to the birds and the wild animals. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>I will devastate this city and make it an object of horror and scorn; all who pass by will be appalled and will scoff because of all its wounds.
