 son of Jehoiakim king of Judah and the officials, the skilled workers and the artisans of Judah were carried into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the <span class="name">Lord</span> showed me two baskets of figs placed in front of the temple of the <span class="name">Lord</span>. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>One basket had very good figs, like those that ripen early; the other basket had very bad figs, so bad they could not be eaten.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then the <span class="name">Lord</span> asked me, &#8220;What do you see, Jeremiah?&#8221;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;Figs,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;The good ones are very good, but the bad ones are so bad they cannot be eaten.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then the word of the <span class="name">Lord</span> came to me: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8220;This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, says: &#8216;Like these good figs, I regard as good the exiles from Judah, whom I sent away from this place to the land of the Babylonians.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>My eyes will watch over them for their good, and I will bring them back to this land. I will build them up and not tear them down; I will plant them and not uproot them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>I will give them a heart to know me, that I am the <span class="name">Lord</span>. They will be my people, and I will be their God, for they will return to me with all their heart.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;But like the bad figs, which are so bad they cannot be eaten,&#8217; says the <span class="name">Lord</span>, &#8216;so will I deal with Zedekiah king of Judah, his officials and the survivors from Jerusalem, whether they remain in this land or live in Egypt. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>I will make them abhorrent and an offense to all the kingdoms of the earth, a reproach and a byword, a curse
