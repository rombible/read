<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>(This was after King Jehoiachin

 and the queen mother, the court officials and the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the skilled workers and the artisans had gone into exile from Jerusalem.)

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8220;Build houses and settle down; plant gardens and eat what they produce. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Marry and have sons and daughters; find wives for your sons and give your daughters in marriage, so that they too may have sons and daughters. Increase in number there; do not decrease. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Also, seek the peace and prosperity of the city to which I have carried you into exile. Pray to the <span class="name">Lord</span> for it, because if it prospers, you too will prosper.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Yes, this is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> Almighty, the God of Israel, says: &#8220;Do not let the prophets and diviners among you deceive you. Do not listen to the dreams you encourage them to have. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>They are prophesying lies to you in my name. I have not sent them,&#8221; declares the <span class="name">Lord</span>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> says: &#8220;When seventy years are completed for Babylon, I will come to you and fulfill my good promise to bring you back to this place. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For I know the plans I have for you,&#8221; declares the <span class="name">Lord</span>, &#8220;plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then you will call on me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>I will be found by you,&#8221; declares the <span class="name">Lord</span>, &#8220;and will bring you back from captivity.

 I will gather you from all the nations and places where I have banished you,&#8221; declares the <span class="name">Lord</span>, &#8220;and will bring you back to the place from which I carried you into exile.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>You may say, &#8220;The <span class="name">Lord</span> has raised up prophets for us in Babylon,&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>but this is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> says about the king who sits on David&#8217;s throne and all the people who remain in this city, your fellow citizens who did not go with you into exile&#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>yes, this is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> Almighty says: &#8220;I will send the sword, famine and plague against them and I will make them like figs that are so bad they cannot be eaten. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>I will pursue them with the sword, famine and plague and will make them abhorrent to all the kingdoms of the earth, a curse
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, their names will be used in cursing (see verse 22); or, others will see that they are cursed.">c</a></sup></span>
 and an object of horror, of scorn and reproach, among all the nations where I drive them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>For they have not listened to my words,&#8221; declares the <span class="name">Lord</span>, &#8220;words that I sent to them again and again by my servants the prophets.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> Almighty, the God of Israel, says about Ahab son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah son of Maaseiah, who are prophesying lies to you in my name: &#8220;I will deliver them into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he will put them to death before your very eyes. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Because of them, all the exiles from Judah who are in Babylon will use this curse: &#8216;May the <span class="name">Lord</span> treat you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babylon burned in the fire.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>For they have done outrageous things in Israel; they have committed adultery with their neighbors&#8217; wives, and in my name they have uttered lies&#8212;which I did not authorize.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>So why have you not reprimanded Jeremiah from Anathoth, who poses as a prophet among you? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>He has sent this message to us in Babylon: It will be a long time. Therefore build houses and settle down; plant gardens and eat what they produce.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
