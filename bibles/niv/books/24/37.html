<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew Koniah, a variant of Jehoiachin">a</a></sup></span>
 son of Jehoiakim. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Neither he nor his attendants nor the people of the land paid any attention to the words the <span class="name">Lord</span> had spoken through Jeremiah the prophet.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>King Zedekiah, however, sent Jehukal son of Shelemiah with the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah to Jeremiah the prophet with this message: &#8220;Please pray to the <span class="name">Lord</span> our God for us.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Now Jeremiah was free to come and go among the people, for he had not yet been put in prison. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Pharaoh&#8217;s army had marched out of Egypt, and when the Babylonians
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or Chaldeans; also in verses 8, 9, 13 and 14">b</a></sup></span>
 who were besieging Jerusalem heard the report about them, they withdrew from Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then the word of the <span class="name">Lord</span> came to Jeremiah the prophet: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8220;This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, says: Tell the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of me, &#8216;Pharaoh&#8217;s army, which has marched out to support you, will go back to its own land, to Egypt. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then the Babylonians will return and attack this city; they will capture it and burn it down.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> says: Do not deceive yourselves, thinking, &#8216;The Babylonians will surely leave us.&#8217; They will not! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Even if you were to defeat the entire Babylonian
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or Chaldean; also in verse 11">c</a></sup></span>
 army that is attacking you and only wounded men were left in their tents, they would come out and burn this city down.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>After the Babylonian army had withdrawn from Jerusalem because of Pharaoh&#8217;s army, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Jeremiah started to leave the city to go to the territory of Benjamin to get his share of the property among the people there. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>But when he reached the Benjamin Gate, the captain of the guard, whose name was Irijah son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah, arrested him and said, &#8220;You are deserting to the Babylonians!&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>&#8220;That&#8217;s not true!&#8221; Jeremiah said. &#8220;I am not deserting to the Babylonians.&#8221; But Irijah would not listen to him; instead, he arrested Jeremiah and brought him to the officials. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>They were angry with Jeremiah and had him beaten and imprisoned in the house of Jonathan the secretary, which they had made into a prison.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Jeremiah was put into a vaulted cell in a dungeon, where he remained a long time. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then King Zedekiah sent for him and had him brought to the palace, where he asked him privately, &#8220;Is there any word from the <span class="name">Lord</span>?&#8221;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Jeremiah replied, &#8220;you will be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, &#8220;What crime have I committed against you or your attendants or this people, that you have put me in prison? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Where are your prophets who prophesied to you, &#8216;The king of Babylon will not attack you or this land&#8217;? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>But now, my lord the king, please listen. Let me bring my petition before you: Do not send me back to the house of Jonathan the secretary, or I will die there.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>King Zedekiah then gave orders for Jeremiah to be placed in the courtyard of the guard and given a loaf of bread from the street of the bakers each day until all the bread in the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard.</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><A name="footnotes"></a><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotebot">Hebrew <i>Koniah,</i> a variant of <i>Jehoiachin</i></span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotebot">Or <i>Chaldeans</i>; also in verses 8, 9, 13 and 14</span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">c</span> <span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotebot">Or <i>Chaldean</i>; also in verse 11</span><br><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
