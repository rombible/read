<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/45-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, says to you, Baruch: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/45-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>You said, &#8216;Woe to me! The <span class="name">Lord</span> has added sorrow to my pain; I am worn out with groaning and find no rest.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/45-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But the <span class="name">Lord</span> has told me to say to you, &#8216;This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> says: I will overthrow what I have built and uproot what I have planted, throughout the earth. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/45-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Should you then seek great things for yourself? Do not seek them. For I will bring disaster on all people, declares the <span class="name">Lord</span>, but wherever you go I will let you escape with your life.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
