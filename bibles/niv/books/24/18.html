<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Go down to the potter&#8217;s house, and there I will give you my message.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So I went down to the potter&#8217;s house, and I saw him working at the wheel. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But the pot he was shaping from the clay was marred in his hands; so the potter formed it into another pot, shaping it as seemed best to him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then the word of the <span class="name">Lord</span> came to me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>He said, &#8220;Can I not do with you, Israel, as this potter does?&#8221; declares the <span class="name">Lord</span>. &#8220;Like clay in the hand of the potter, so are you in my hand, Israel. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>If at any time I announce that a nation or kingdom is to be uprooted, torn down and destroyed, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>and if that nation I warned repents of its evil, then I will relent and not inflict on it the disaster I had planned. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And if at another time I announce that a nation or kingdom is to be built up and planted, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and if it does evil in my sight and does not obey me, then I will reconsider the good I had intended to do for it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8220;Now therefore say to the people of Judah and those living in Jerusalem, &#8216;This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> says: Look! I am preparing a disaster for you and devising a plan against you. So turn from your evil ways, each one of you, and reform your ways and your actions.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But they will reply, &#8216;It&#8217;s no use. We will continue with our own plans; we will all follow the stubbornness of our evil hearts.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
