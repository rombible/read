His mother&#8217;s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah; she was from Libnah. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>He did evil in the eyes of the <span class="name">Lord</span>, just as Jehoiakim had done. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>It was because of the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s anger that all this happened to Jerusalem and Judah, and in the end he thrust them from his presence.</p><p class="reg">Now Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So in the ninth year of Zedekiah&#8217;s reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his whole army. They encamped outside the city and built siege works all around it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>The city was kept under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>By the ninth day of the fourth month the famine in the city had become so severe that there was no food for the people to eat. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then the city wall was broken through, and the whole army fled. They left the city at night through the gate between the two walls near the king&#8217;s garden, though the Babylonians
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or Chaldeans; also in verse 17">a</a></sup></span>
 were surrounding the city. They fled toward the Arabah,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or the Jordan Valley">b</a></sup></span>
 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>but the Babylonian
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or Chaldean; also in verse 14">c</a></sup></span>
 army pursued King Zedekiah and overtook him in the plains of Jericho. All his soldiers were separated from him and scattered, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and he was captured.</p><p class="reg">He was taken to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he pronounced sentence on him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>There at Riblah the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes; he also killed all the officials of Judah. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then he put out Zedekiah&#8217;s eyes, bound him with bronze shackles and took him to Babylon, where he put him in prison till the day of his death.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>On the tenth day of the fifth month, in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard, who served the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>He set fire to the temple of the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the royal palace and all the houses of Jerusalem. Every important building he burned down. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>The whole Babylonian army, under the commander of the imperial guard, broke down all the walls around Jerusalem. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Nebuzaradan the commander of the guard carried into exile some of the poorest people and those who remained in the city, along with the rest of the craftsmen

 and those who had deserted to the king of Babylon. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But Nebuzaradan left behind the rest of the poorest people of the land to work the vineyards and fields.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>The Babylonians broke up the bronze pillars, the movable stands and the bronze Sea that were at the temple of the <span class="name">Lord</span> and they carried all the bronze to Babylon. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>They also took away the pots, shovels, wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, dishes and all the bronze articles used in the temple service. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>The commander of the imperial guard took away the basins, censers, sprinkling bowls, pots, lampstands, dishes and bowls used for drink offerings&#8212;all that were made of pure gold or silver.</p>

 high and was decorated with a network and pomegranates of bronze all around. The other pillar, with its pomegranates, was similar.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>The commander of the guard took as prisoners Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the priest next in rank and the three doorkeepers.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Nebuzaradan the commander took them all and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
