<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>he had Jeremiah the prophet beaten and put in the stocks at the Upper Gate of Benjamin at the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s temple. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>The next day, when Pashhur released him from the stocks, Jeremiah said to him, &#8220;The <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s name for you is not Pashhur, but Terror on Every Side. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For this is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> says: &#8216;I will make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends; with your own eyes you will see them fall by the sword of their enemies. I will give all Judah into the hands of the king of Babylon, who will carry them away to Babylon or put them to the sword. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>I will deliver all the wealth of this city into the hands of their enemies&#8212;all its products, all its valuables and all the treasures of the kings of Judah. They will take it away as plunder and carry it off to Babylon. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And you, Pashhur, and all who live in your house will go into exile to Babylon. There you will die and be buried, you and all your friends to whom you have prophesied lies.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
