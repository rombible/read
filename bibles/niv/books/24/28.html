<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> Almighty, the God of Israel, says: &#8216;I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Within two years I will bring back to this place all the articles of the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s house that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon removed from here and took to Babylon. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>I will also bring back to this place Jehoiachin
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew Jeconiah, a variant of Jehoiachin">a</a></sup></span>
 son of Jehoiakim king of Judah and all the other exiles from Judah who went to Babylon,&#8217; declares the <span class="name">Lord</span>, &#8216;for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then the prophet Jeremiah replied to the prophet Hananiah before the priests and all the people who were standing in the house of the <span class="name">Lord</span>. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>He said, &#8220;Amen! May the <span class="name">Lord</span> do so! May the <span class="name">Lord</span> fulfill the words you have prophesied by bringing the articles of the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s house and all the exiles back to this place from Babylon. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Nevertheless, listen to what I have to say in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>From early times the prophets who preceded you and me have prophesied war, disaster and plague against many countries and great kingdoms. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But the prophet who prophesies peace will be recognized as one truly sent by the <span class="name">Lord</span> only if his prediction comes true.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then the prophet Hananiah took the yoke off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah and broke it, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>and he said before all the people, &#8220;This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> says: &#8216;In the same way I will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon off the neck of all the nations within two years.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221; At this, the prophet Jeremiah went on his way.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>After the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, the word of the <span class="name">Lord</span> came to Jeremiah: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8220;Go and tell Hananiah, &#8216;This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> says: You have broken a wooden yoke, but in its place you will get a yoke of iron. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I will put an iron yoke on the necks of all these nations to make them serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and they will serve him. I will even give him control over the wild animals.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then the prophet Jeremiah said to Hananiah the prophet, &#8220;Listen, Hananiah! The <span class="name">Lord</span> has not sent you, yet you have persuaded this nation to trust in lies. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Therefore this is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> says: &#8216;I am about to remove you from the face of the earth.
