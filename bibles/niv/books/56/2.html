<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/titus/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Teach the older men to be temperate, worthy of respect, self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love and in endurance.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/titus/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Likewise, teach the older women to be reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but to teach what is good. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/titus/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then they can urge the younger women to love their husbands and children, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/titus/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home, to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word of God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/titus/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Similarly, encourage the young men to be self-controlled. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/titus/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>In everything set them an example by doing what is good. In your teaching show integrity, seriousness 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/titus/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>and soundness of speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose you may be ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/titus/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Teach slaves to be subject to their masters in everything, to try to please them, not to talk back to them, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/titus/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and not to steal from them, but to show that they can be fully trusted, so that in every way they will make the teaching about God our Savior attractive.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/titus/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For the grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/titus/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>It teaches us to say &#8220;No&#8221; to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright and godly lives in this present age, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/titus/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>while we wait for the blessed hope&#8212;the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/titus/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>who gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself a people that are his very own, eager to do what is good.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/titus/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>These, then, are the things you should teach. Encourage and rebuke with all authority. Do not let anyone despise you.</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
