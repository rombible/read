 elders in every town, as I directed you.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/titus/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Since an overseer manages God&#8217;s household, he must be blameless&#8212;not overbearing, not quick-tempered, not given to drunkenness, not violent, not pursuing dishonest gain. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/titus/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Rather, he must be hospitable, one who loves what is good, who is self-controlled, upright, holy and disciplined.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/titus/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>They must be silenced, because they are disrupting whole households by teaching things they ought not to teach&#8212;and that for the sake of dishonest gain.
