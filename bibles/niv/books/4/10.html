<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Make two trumpets of hammered silver, and use them for calling the community together and for having the camps set out. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>When both are sounded, the whole community is to assemble before you at the entrance to the tent of meeting. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>If only one is sounded, the leaders&#8212;the heads of the clans of Israel&#8212;are to assemble before you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>When a trumpet blast is sounded, the tribes camping on the east are to set out. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>At the sounding of a second blast, the camps on the south are to set out. The blast will be the signal for setting out. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>To gather the assembly, blow the trumpets, but not with the signal for setting out.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8220;The sons of Aaron, the priests, are to blow the trumpets. This is to be a lasting ordinance for you and the generations to come. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>When you go into battle in your own land against an enemy who is oppressing you, sound a blast on the trumpets. Then you will be remembered by the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God and rescued from your enemies. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Also at your times of rejoicing&#8212;your appointed festivals and New Moon feasts&#8212;you are to sound the trumpets over your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, and they will be a memorial for you before your God. I am the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God.&#8221;</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then the Israelites set out from the Desert of Sinai and traveled from place to place until the cloud came to rest in the Desert of Paran. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>They set out, this first time, at the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s command through Moses.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>The divisions of the camp of Judah went first, under their standard. Nahshon son of Amminadab was in command.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>This was the order of march for the Israelite divisions as they set out.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Now Moses said to Hobab son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses&#8217; father-in-law, &#8220;We are setting out for the place about which the <span class="name">Lord</span> said, &#8216;I will give it to you.&#8217; Come with us and we will treat you well, for the <span class="name">Lord</span> has promised good things to Israel.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>He answered, &#8220;No, I will not go; I am going back to my own land and my own people.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>But Moses said, &#8220;Please do not leave us. You know where we should camp in the wilderness, and you can be our eyes.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>The cloud of the <span class="name">Lord</span> was over them by day when they set out from the camp.</p>
