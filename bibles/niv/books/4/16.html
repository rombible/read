<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and rose up against Moses. With them were 250 Israelite men, well-known community leaders who had been appointed members of the council. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>They came as a group to oppose Moses and Aaron and said to them, &#8220;You have gone too far! The whole community is holy, every one of them, and the <span class="name">Lord</span> is with them. Why then do you set yourselves above the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s assembly?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>When Moses heard this, he fell facedown. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then he said to Korah and all his followers: &#8220;In the morning the <span class="name">Lord</span> will show who belongs to him and who is holy, and he will have that person come near him. The man he chooses he will cause to come near him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>You, Korah, and all your followers are to do this: Take censers 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and tomorrow put burning coals and incense in them before the <span class="name">Lord</span>. The man the <span class="name">Lord</span> chooses will be the one who is holy. You Levites have gone too far!&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Moses also said to Korah, &#8220;Now listen, you Levites! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Isn&#8217;t it enough for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the rest of the Israelite community and brought you near himself to do the work at the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s tabernacle and to stand before the community and minister to them? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>He has brought you and all your fellow Levites near himself, but now you are trying to get the priesthood too. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>It is against the <span class="name">Lord</span> that you and all your followers have banded together. Who is Aaron that you should grumble against him?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then Moses summoned Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab. But they said, &#8220;We will not come! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Isn&#8217;t it enough that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness? And now you also want to lord it over us! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Moreover, you haven&#8217;t brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey or given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Do you want to treat these men like slaves
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or to deceive these men; Hebrew Will you gouge out the eyes of these men">b</a></sup></span>
? No, we will not come!&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then Moses became very angry and said to the <span class="name">Lord</span>, &#8220;Do not accept their offering. I have not taken so much as a donkey from them, nor have I wronged any of them.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Moses said to Korah, &#8220;You and all your followers are to appear before the <span class="name">Lord</span> tomorrow&#8212;you and they and Aaron. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Each man is to take his censer and put incense in it&#8212;250 censers in all&#8212;and present it before the <span class="name">Lord</span>. You and Aaron are to present your censers also.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>So each of them took his censer, put burning coals and incense in it, and stood with Moses and Aaron at the entrance to the tent of meeting. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>When Korah had gathered all his followers in opposition to them at the entrance to the tent of meeting, the glory of the <span class="name">Lord</span> appeared to the entire assembly. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> said to Moses and Aaron, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>&#8220;Separate yourselves from this assembly so I can put an end to them at once.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But Moses and Aaron fell facedown and cried out, &#8220;O God, the God who gives breath to all living things, will you be angry with the entire assembly when only one man sins?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Then the <span class="name">Lord</span> said to Moses, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>&#8220;Say to the assembly, &#8216;Move away from the tents of Korah, Dathan and Abiram.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Moses got up and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>He warned the assembly, &#8220;Move back from the tents of these wicked men! Do not touch anything belonging to them, or you will be swept away because of all their sins.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>So they moved away from the tents of Korah, Dathan and Abiram. Dathan and Abiram had come out and were standing with their wives, children and little ones at the entrances to their tents.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then Moses said, &#8220;This is how you will know that the <span class="name">Lord</span> has sent me to do all these things and that it was not my idea: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>If these men die a natural death and suffer the fate of all mankind, then the <span class="name">Lord</span> has not sent me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>But if the <span class="name">Lord</span> brings about something totally new, and the earth opens its mouth and swallows them, with everything that belongs to them, and they go down alive into the realm of the dead, then you will know that these men have treated the <span class="name">Lord</span> with contempt.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>As soon as he finished saying all this, the ground under them split apart 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them and their households, and all those associated with Korah, together with their possessions. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>They went down alive into the realm of the dead, with everything they owned; the earth closed over them, and they perished and were gone from the community. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>At their cries, all the Israelites around them fled, shouting, &#8220;The earth is going to swallow us too!&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>And fire came out from the <span class="name">Lord</span> and consumed the 250 men who were offering the incense.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> said to Moses, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>&#8220;Tell Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest, to remove the censers from the charred remains and scatter the coals some distance away, for the censers are holy&#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>the censers of the men who sinned at the cost of their lives. Hammer the censers into sheets to overlay the altar, for they were presented before the <span class="name">Lord</span> and have become holy. Let them be a sign to the Israelites.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>So Eleazar the priest collected the bronze censers brought by those who had been burned to death, and he had them hammered out to overlay the altar, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>as the <span class="name">Lord</span> directed him through Moses. This was to remind the Israelites that no one except a descendant of Aaron should come to burn incense before the <span class="name">Lord</span>, or he would become like Korah and his followers.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>The next day the whole Israelite community grumbled against Moses and Aaron. &#8220;You have killed the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s people,&#8221; they said.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>But when the assembly gathered in opposition to Moses and Aaron and turned toward the tent of meeting, suddenly the cloud covered it and the glory of the <span class="name">Lord</span> appeared. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>Then Moses and Aaron went to the front of the tent of meeting, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>and the <span class="name">Lord</span> said to Moses, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>&#8220;Get away from this assembly so I can put an end to them at once.&#8221; And they fell facedown.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span>Then Moses said to Aaron, &#8220;Take your censer and put incense in it, along with burning coals from the altar, and hurry to the assembly to make atonement for them. Wrath has come out from the <span class="name">Lord</span>; the plague has started.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-47.htm"><b>47</b></a></span>So Aaron did as Moses said, and ran into the midst of the assembly. The plague had already started among the people, but Aaron offered the incense and made atonement for them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-48.htm"><b>48</b></a></span>He stood between the living and the dead, and the plague stopped. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-49.htm"><b>49</b></a></span>But 14,700 people died from the plague, in addition to those who had died because of Korah. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-50.htm"><b>50</b></a></span>Then Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance to the tent of meeting, for the plague had stopped.
