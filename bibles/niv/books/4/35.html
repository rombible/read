<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Command the Israelites to give the Levites towns to live in from the inheritance the Israelites will possess. And give them pasturelands around the towns. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then they will have towns to live in and pasturelands for the cattle they own and all their other animals.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>They will be places of refuge from the avenger, so that anyone accused of murder may not die before they stand trial before the assembly.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Give three on this side of the Jordan and three in Canaan as cities of refuge. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>These six towns will be a place of refuge for Israelites and for foreigners residing among them, so that anyone who has killed another accidentally can flee there.</p>
