<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/12-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Has the <span class="name">Lord</span> spoken only through Moses?&#8221; they asked. &#8220;Hasn&#8217;t he also spoken through us?&#8221; And the <span class="name">Lord</span> heard this.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/12-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>(Now Moses was a very humble man, more humble than anyone else on the face of the earth.)</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/12-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then the <span class="name">Lord</span> came down in a pillar of cloud; he stood at the entrance to the tent and summoned Aaron and Miriam. When the two of them stepped forward, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/12-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>he said, &#8220;Listen to my words:</p><div class="stanza"><p class="line1">&#8220;When there is a prophet among you,</p><p class="line2">I, the <span class="name">Lord</span>, reveal myself to them in visions,</p><p class="line2">I speak to them in dreams.</p>

&#8212;it became as white as snow. Aaron turned toward her and saw that she had a defiling skin disease, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/12-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>and he said to Moses, &#8220;Please, my lord, I ask you not to hold against us the sin we have so foolishly committed.
