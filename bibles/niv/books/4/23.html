<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/23-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Balak did as Balaam said, and the two of them offered a bull and a ram on each altar.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/23-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then Balaam said to Balak, &#8220;Stay here beside your offering while I go aside.
