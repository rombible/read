<div class="chap"><p class="sectionhead">Balak Summons Balaam</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Then the Israelites traveled to the plains of Moab and camped along the Jordan across from Jericho.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Now Balak son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and Moab was terrified because there were so many people. Indeed, Moab was filled with dread because of the Israelites.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>The Moabites said to the elders of Midian, &#8220;This horde is going to lick up everything around us, as an ox licks up the grass of the field.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">So Balak son of Zippor, who was king of Moab at that time, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>sent messengers to summon Balaam son of Beor, who was at Pethor, near the Euphrates River, in his native land. Balak said:</p><p class="emb">&#8220;A people has come out of Egypt; they cover the face of the land and have settled next to me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now come and put a curse on these people, because they are too powerful for me. Perhaps then I will be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land. For I know that whoever you bless is blessed, and whoever you curse is cursed.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>The elders of Moab and Midian left, taking with them the fee for divination. When they came to Balaam, they told him what Balak had said.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8220;Spend the night here,&#8221; Balaam said to them, &#8220;and I will report back to you with the answer the <span class="name">Lord</span> gives me.&#8221; So the Moabite officials stayed with him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>God came to Balaam and asked, &#8220;Who are these men with you?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Balaam said to God, &#8220;Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, sent me this message: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8216;A people that has come out of Egypt covers the face of the land. Now come and put a curse on them for me. Perhaps then I will be able to fight them and drive them away.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But God said to Balaam, &#8220;Do not go with them. You must not put a curse on those people, because they are blessed.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>The next morning Balaam got up and said to Balak&#8217;s officials, &#8220;Go back to your own country, for the <span class="name">Lord</span> has refused to let me go with you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So the Moabite officials returned to Balak and said, &#8220;Balaam refused to come with us.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then Balak sent other officials, more numerous and more distinguished than the first. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>They came to Balaam and said:</p><p class="emb">&#8220;This is what Balak son of Zippor says: Do not let anything keep you from coming to me, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>because I will reward you handsomely and do whatever you say. Come and put a curse on these people for me.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>But Balaam answered them, &#8220;Even if Balak gave me all the silver and gold in his palace, I could not do anything great or small to go beyond the command of the <span class="name">Lord</span> my God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Now spend the night here so that I can find out what else the <span class="name">Lord</span> will tell me.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>That night God came to Balaam and said, &#8220;Since these men have come to summon you, go with them, but do only what I tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Balaam&#8217;s Donkey</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Balaam got up in the morning, saddled his donkey and went with the Moabite officials. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But God was very angry when he went, and the angel of the <span class="name">Lord</span> stood in the road to oppose him. Balaam was riding on his donkey, and his two servants were with him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>When the donkey saw the angel of the <span class="name">Lord</span> standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand, it turned off the road into a field. Balaam beat it to get it back on the road.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then the angel of the <span class="name">Lord</span> stood in a narrow path through the vineyards, with walls on both sides. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>When the donkey saw the angel of the <span class="name">Lord</span>, it pressed close to the wall, crushing Balaam&#8217;s foot against it. So he beat the donkey again.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Then the angel of the <span class="name">Lord</span> moved on ahead and stood in a narrow place where there was no room to turn, either to the right or to the left. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>When the donkey saw the angel of the <span class="name">Lord</span>, it lay down under Balaam, and he was angry and beat it with his staff. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then the <span class="name">Lord</span> opened the donkey&#8217;s mouth, and it said to Balaam, &#8220;What have I done to you to make you beat me these three times?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Balaam answered the donkey, &#8220;You have made a fool of me! If only I had a sword in my hand, I would kill you right now.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>The donkey said to Balaam, &#8220;Am I not your own donkey, which you have always ridden, to this day?

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Then the <span class="name">Lord</span> opened Balaam&#8217;s eyes, and he saw the angel of the <span class="name">Lord</span> standing in the road with his sword drawn.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>The angel of the <span class="name">Lord</span> asked him, &#8220;Why have you beaten your donkey these three times? I have come here to oppose you because your path is a reckless one before me.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>The donkey saw me and turned away from me these three times. If it had not turned away, I would certainly have killed you by now, but I would have spared it.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Balaam said to the angel of the <span class="name">Lord</span>, &#8220;I have sinned.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>The angel of the <span class="name">Lord</span> said to Balaam, &#8220;Go with the men, but speak only what I tell you.&#8221; So Balaam went with Balak&#8217;s officials.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the Moabite town on the Arnon border, at the edge of his territory.
