<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Take vengeance on the Midianites for the Israelites. After that, you will be gathered to your people.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So Moses said to the people, &#8220;Arm some of your men to go to war against the Midianites so that they may carry out the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s vengeance on them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Send into battle a thousand men from each of the tribes of Israel.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So twelve thousand men armed for battle, a thousand from each tribe, were supplied from the clans of Israel. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Moses sent them into battle, a thousand from each tribe, along with Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, who took with him articles from the sanctuary and the trumpets for signaling.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>They fought against Midian, as the <span class="name">Lord</span> commanded Moses, and killed every man. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Among their victims were Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur and Reba&#8212;the five kings of Midian. They also killed Balaam son of Beor with the sword. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>The Israelites captured the Midianite women and children and took all the Midianite herds, flocks and goods as plunder. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>They burned all the towns where the Midianites had settled, as well as all their camps. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>They took all the plunder and spoils, including the people and animals, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>and brought the captives, spoils and plunder to Moses and Eleazar the priest and the Israelite assembly at their camp on the plains of Moab, by the Jordan across from Jericho.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Moses, Eleazar the priest and all the leaders of the community went to meet them outside the camp.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>&#8220;They were the ones who followed Balaam&#8217;s advice and enticed the Israelites to be unfaithful to the <span class="name">Lord</span> in the Peor incident, so that a plague struck the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s people. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Now kill all the boys. And kill every woman who has slept with a man,

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then Eleazar the priest said to the soldiers who had gone into battle, &#8220;This is what is required by the law that the <span class="name">Lord</span> gave Moses:

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>and anything else that can withstand fire must be put through the fire, and then it will be clean.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>On the seventh day wash your clothes and you will be clean. Then you may come into the camp.&#8221;</p>
