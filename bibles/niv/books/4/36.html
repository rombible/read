<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/36-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>They said, &#8220;When the <span class="name">Lord</span> commanded my lord to give the land as an inheritance to the Israelites by lot, he ordered you to give the inheritance of our brother Zelophehad to his daughters. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/36-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Now suppose they marry men from other Israelite tribes; then their inheritance will be taken from our ancestral inheritance and added to that of the tribe they marry into. And so part of the inheritance allotted to us will be taken away. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/36-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>When the Year of Jubilee for the Israelites comes, their inheritance will be added to that of the tribe into which they marry, and their property will be taken from the tribal inheritance of our ancestors.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/36-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then at the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s command Moses gave this order to the Israelites: &#8220;What the tribe of the descendants of Joseph is saying is right. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/36-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> commands for Zelophehad&#8217;s daughters: They may marry anyone they please as long as they marry within their father&#8217;s tribal clan. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/36-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>No inheritance in Israel is to pass from one tribe to another, for every Israelite shall keep the tribal inheritance of their ancestors. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/36-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Every daughter who inherits land in any Israelite tribe must marry someone in her father&#8217;s tribal clan, so that every Israelite will possess the inheritance of their ancestors. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/36-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>No inheritance may pass from one tribe to another, for each Israelite tribe is to keep the land it inherits.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/36-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So Zelophehad&#8217;s daughters did as the <span class="name">Lord</span> commanded Moses. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/36-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Zelophehad&#8217;s daughters&#8212;Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milkah and Noah&#8212;married their cousins on their father&#8217;s side. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/36-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>They married within the clans of the descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in their father&#8217;s tribe and clan.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/36-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>These are the commands and regulations the <span class="name">Lord</span> gave through Moses to the Israelites on the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho.</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
