<div class="chap"><p class="sectionhead">The Passover</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> spoke to Moses in the Desert of Sinai in the first month of the second year after they came out of Egypt. He said, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Have the Israelites celebrate the Passover at the appointed time. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Celebrate it at the appointed time, at twilight on the fourteenth day of this month, in accordance with all its rules and regulations.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So Moses told the Israelites to celebrate the Passover, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and they did so in the Desert of Sinai at twilight on the fourteenth day of the first month. The Israelites did everything just as the <span class="name">Lord</span> commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But some of them could not celebrate the Passover on that day because they were ceremonially unclean on account of a dead body. So they came to Moses and Aaron that same day 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and said to Moses, &#8220;We have become unclean because of a dead body, but why should we be kept from presenting the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s offering with the other Israelites at the appointed time?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Moses answered them, &#8220;Wait until I find out what the <span class="name">Lord</span> commands concerning you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then the <span class="name">Lord</span> said to Moses, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8220;Tell the Israelites: &#8216;When any of you or your descendants are unclean because of a dead body or are away on a journey, they are still to celebrate the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s Passover, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>but they are to do it on the fourteenth day of the second month at twilight. They are to eat the lamb, together with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>They must not leave any of it till morning or break any of its bones. When they celebrate the Passover, they must follow all the regulations. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>But if anyone who is ceremonially clean and not on a journey fails to celebrate the Passover, they must be cut off from their people for not presenting the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s offering at the appointed time. They will bear the consequences of their sin.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;A foreigner residing among you is also to celebrate the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s Passover in accordance with its rules and regulations. You must have the same regulations for both the foreigner and the native-born.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="sectionhead">The Cloud Above the Tabernacle</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>On the day the tabernacle, the tent of the covenant law, was set up, the cloud covered it. From evening till morning the cloud above the tabernacle looked like fire. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>That is how it continued to be; the cloud covered it, and at night it looked like fire. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Whenever the cloud lifted from above the tent, the Israelites set out; wherever the cloud settled, the Israelites encamped. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>At the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s command the Israelites set out, and at his command they encamped. As long as the cloud stayed over the tabernacle, they remained in camp. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>When the cloud remained over the tabernacle a long time, the Israelites obeyed the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s order and did not set out. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Sometimes the cloud was over the tabernacle only a few days; at the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s command they would encamp, and then at his command they would set out. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Sometimes the cloud stayed only from evening till morning, and when it lifted in the morning, they set out. Whether by day or by night, whenever the cloud lifted, they set out. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Whether the cloud stayed over the tabernacle for two days or a month or a year, the Israelites would remain in camp and not set out; but when it lifted, they would set out. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/9-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>At the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s command they encamped, and at the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s command they set out.
