<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Aaron did so; he set up the lamps so that they faced forward on the lampstand, just as the <span class="name">Lord</span> commanded Moses. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>This is how the lampstand was made: It was made of hammered gold&#8212;from its base to its blossoms. The lampstand was made exactly like the pattern the <span class="name">Lord</span> had shown Moses.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>To purify them, do this: Sprinkle the water of cleansing on them; then have them shave their whole bodies and wash their clothes. And so they will purify themselves.
