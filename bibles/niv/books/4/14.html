<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>All the Israelites grumbled against Moses and Aaron, and the whole assembly said to them, &#8220;If only we had died in Egypt! Or in this wilderness! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Why is the <span class="name">Lord</span> bringing us to this land only to let us fall by the sword? Our wives and children will be taken as plunder. Wouldn&#8217;t it be better for us to go back to Egypt?&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And they said to each other, &#8220;We should choose a leader and go back to Egypt.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then Moses and Aaron fell facedown in front of the whole Israelite assembly gathered there. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, who were among those who had explored the land, tore their clothes 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and said to the entire Israelite assembly, &#8220;The land we passed through and explored is exceedingly good. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>If the <span class="name">Lord</span> is pleased with us, he will lead us into that land, a land flowing with milk and honey, and will give it to us. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Only do not rebel against the <span class="name">Lord</span>. And do not be afraid of the people of the land, because we will devour them. Their protection is gone, but the <span class="name">Lord</span> is with us. Do not be afraid of them.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>But the whole assembly talked about stoning them. Then the glory of the <span class="name">Lord</span> appeared at the tent of meeting to all the Israelites. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;How long will these people treat me with contempt? How long will they refuse to believe in me, in spite of all the signs I have performed among them? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>I will strike them down with a plague and destroy them, but I will make you into a nation greater and stronger than they.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Moses said to the <span class="name">Lord</span>, &#8220;Then the Egyptians will hear about it! By your power you brought these people up from among them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And they will tell the inhabitants of this land about it. They have already heard that you, <span class="name">Lord</span>, are with these people and that you, <span class="name">Lord</span>, have been seen face to face, that your cloud stays over them, and that you go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>If you put all these people to death, leaving none alive, the nations who have heard this report about you will say, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>&#8216;The <span class="name">Lord</span> was not able to bring these people into the land he promised them on oath, so he slaughtered them in the wilderness.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>&#8220;Now may the Lord&#8217;s strength be displayed, just as you have declared: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>&#8216;The <span class="name">Lord</span> is slow to anger, abounding in love and forgiving sin and rebellion. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>In accordance with your great love, forgive the sin of these people, just as you have pardoned them from the time they left Egypt until now.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> replied, &#8220;I have forgiven them, as you asked. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Nevertheless, as surely as I live and as surely as the glory of the <span class="name">Lord</span> fills the whole earth, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>not one of those who saw my glory and the signs I performed in Egypt and in the wilderness but who disobeyed me and tested me ten times&#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>not one of them will ever see the land I promised on oath to their ancestors. No one who has treated me with contempt will ever see it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>But because my servant Caleb has a different spirit and follows me wholeheartedly, I will bring him into the land he went to, and his descendants will inherit it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Since the Amalekites and the Canaanites are living in the valleys, turn back tomorrow and set out toward the desert along the route to the Red Sea.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> said to Moses and Aaron: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>&#8220;How long will this wicked community grumble against me? I have heard the complaints of these grumbling Israelites. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>So tell them, &#8216;As surely as I live, declares the <span class="name">Lord</span>, I will do to you the very thing I heard you say: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>In this wilderness your bodies will fall&#8212;every one of you twenty years old or more who was counted in the census and who has grumbled against me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Not one of you will enter the land I swore with uplifted hand to make your home, except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>As for your children that you said would be taken as plunder, I will bring them in to enjoy the land you have rejected. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>But as for you, your bodies will fall in this wilderness. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Your children will be shepherds here for forty years, suffering for your unfaithfulness, until the last of your bodies lies in the wilderness. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>For forty years&#8212;one year for each of the forty days you explored the land&#8212;you will suffer for your sins and know what it is like to have me against you.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>I, the <span class="name">Lord</span>, have spoken, and I will surely do these things to this whole wicked community, which has banded together against me. They will meet their end in this wilderness; here they will die.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>So the men Moses had sent to explore the land, who returned and made the whole community grumble against him by spreading a bad report about it&#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>these men who were responsible for spreading the bad report about the land were struck down and died of a plague before the <span class="name">Lord</span>. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>Of the men who went to explore the land, only Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh survived.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>When Moses reported this to all the Israelites, they mourned bitterly. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>Early the next morning they set out for the highest point in the hill country, saying, &#8220;Now we are ready to go up to the land the <span class="name">Lord</span> promised.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>But Moses said, &#8220;Why are you disobeying the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s command? This will not succeed! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>Do not go up, because the <span class="name">Lord</span> is not with you. You will be defeated by your enemies, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>for the Amalekites and the Canaanites will face you there. Because you have turned away from the <span class="name">Lord</span>, he will not be with you and you will fall by the sword.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>Nevertheless, in their presumption they went up toward the highest point in the hill country, though neither Moses nor the ark of the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s covenant moved from the camp.
