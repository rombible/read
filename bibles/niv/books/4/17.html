<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/17-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Speak to the Israelites and get twelve staffs from them, one from the leader of each of their ancestral tribes. Write the name of each man on his staff. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/17-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>On the staff of Levi write Aaron&#8217;s name, for there must be one staff for the head of each ancestral tribe. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/17-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Place them in the tent of meeting in front of the ark of the covenant law, where I meet with you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/17-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>The staff belonging to the man I choose will sprout, and I will rid myself of this constant grumbling against you by the Israelites.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/17-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So Moses spoke to the Israelites, and their leaders gave him twelve staffs, one for the leader of each of their ancestral tribes, and Aaron&#8217;s staff was among them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/17-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Moses placed the staffs before the <span class="name">Lord</span> in the tent of the covenant law.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/17-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>The next day Moses entered the tent and saw that Aaron&#8217;s staff, which represented the tribe of Levi, had not only sprouted but had budded, blossomed and produced almonds. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/17-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then Moses brought out all the staffs from the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s presence to all the Israelites. They looked at them, and each of the leaders took his own staff.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/17-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;Put back Aaron&#8217;s staff in front of the ark of the covenant law, to be kept as a sign to the rebellious. This will put an end to their grumbling against me, so that they will not die.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/17-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Moses did just as the <span class="name">Lord</span> commanded him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/17-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>The Israelites said to Moses, &#8220;We will die! We are lost, we are all lost! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/17-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Anyone who even comes near the tabernacle of the <span class="name">Lord</span> will die. Are we all going to die?&#8221;</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
