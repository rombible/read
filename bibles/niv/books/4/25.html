<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>who invited them to the sacrifices to their gods. The people ate the sacrificial meal and bowed down before these gods. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So Israel yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor. And the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s anger burned against them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;Take all the leaders of these people, kill them and expose them in broad daylight before the <span class="name">Lord</span>, so that the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s fierce anger may turn away from Israel.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So Moses said to Israel&#8217;s judges, &#8220;Each of you must put to death those of your people who have yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then an Israelite man brought into the camp a Midianite woman right before the eyes of Moses and the whole assembly of Israel while they were weeping at the entrance to the tent of meeting. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>When Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, the priest, saw this, he left the assembly, took a spear in his hand 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>and followed the Israelite into the tent. He drove the spear into both of them, right through the Israelite man and into the woman&#8217;s stomach. Then the plague against the Israelites was stopped; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>but those who died in the plague numbered 24,000.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> said to Moses, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8220;Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, the priest, has turned my anger away from the Israelites. Since he was as zealous for my honor among them as I am, I did not put an end to them in my zeal. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Therefore tell him I am making my covenant of peace with him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>He and his descendants will have a covenant of a lasting priesthood, because he was zealous for the honor of his God and made atonement for the Israelites.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>The name of the Israelite who was killed with the Midianite woman was Zimri son of Salu, the leader of a Simeonite family. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And the name of the Midianite woman who was put to death was Kozbi daughter of Zur, a tribal chief of a Midianite family.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> said to Moses,

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>They treated you as enemies when they deceived you in the Peor incident involving their sister Kozbi, the daughter of a Midianite leader, the woman who was killed when the plague came as a result of that incident.&#8221;</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
