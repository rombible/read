There Miriam died and was buried.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Now there was no water for the community, and the people gathered in opposition to Moses and Aaron. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>They quarreled with Moses and said, &#8220;If only we had died when our brothers fell dead before the <span class="name">Lord</span>! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Why did you bring the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s community into this wilderness, that we and our livestock should die here? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Why did you bring us up out of Egypt to this terrible place? It has no grain or figs, grapevines or pomegranates. And there is no water to drink!&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Moses and Aaron went from the assembly to the entrance to the tent of meeting and fell facedown, and the glory of the <span class="name">Lord</span> appeared to them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> said to Moses, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8220;Take the staff, and you and your brother Aaron gather the assembly together. Speak to that rock before their eyes and it will pour out its water. You will bring water out of the rock for the community so they and their livestock can drink.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So Moses took the staff from the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s presence, just as he commanded him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>He and Aaron gathered the assembly together in front of the rock and Moses said to them, &#8220;Listen, you rebels, must we bring you water out of this rock?&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then Moses raised his arm and struck the rock twice with his staff. Water gushed out, and the community and their livestock drank.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But the <span class="name">Lord</span> said to Moses and Aaron, &#8220;Because you did not trust in me enough to honor me as holy in the sight of the Israelites, you will not bring this community into the land I give them.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>These were the waters of Meribah,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Meribah means quarreling.">a</a></sup></span>
 where the Israelites quarreled with the <span class="name">Lord</span> and where he was proved holy among them.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Edom Denies Israel Passage</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, saying:</p><p class="emb">&#8220;This is what your brother Israel says: You know about all the hardships that have come on us. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Our ancestors went down into Egypt, and we lived there many years. The Egyptians mistreated us and our ancestors, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>but when we cried out to the <span class="name">Lord</span>, he heard our cry and sent an angel and brought us out of Egypt.</p><p class="reg">&#8220;Now we are here at Kadesh, a town on the edge of your territory. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Please let us pass through your country. We will not go through any field or vineyard, or drink water from any well. We will travel along the King&#8217;s Highway and not turn to the right or to the left until we have passed through your territory.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>But Edom answered:</p><p class="emb">&#8220;You may not pass through here; if you try, we will march out and attack you with the sword.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>The Israelites replied:</p><p class="emb">&#8220;We will go along the main road, and if we or our livestock drink any of your water, we will pay for it. We only want to pass through on foot&#8212;nothing else.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Again they answered:</p><p class="emb">&#8220;You may not pass through.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">Then Edom came out against them with a large and powerful army. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Since Edom refused to let them go through their territory, Israel turned away from them.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">The Death of Aaron</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>The whole Israelite community set out from Kadesh and came to Mount Hor. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>At Mount Hor, near the border of Edom, the <span class="name">Lord</span> said to Moses and Aaron, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>&#8220;Aaron will be gathered to his people. He will not enter the land I give the Israelites, because both of you rebelled against my command at the waters of Meribah. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Get Aaron and his son Eleazar and take them up Mount Hor. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Remove Aaron&#8217;s garments and put them on his son Eleazar, for Aaron will be gathered to his people; he will die there.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Moses did as the <span class="name">Lord</span> commanded: They went up Mount Hor in the sight of the whole community.
