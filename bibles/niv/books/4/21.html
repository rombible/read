<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then Israel made this vow to the <span class="name">Lord</span>: &#8220;If you will deliver these people into our hands, we will totally destroy

 to go around Edom. But the people grew impatient on the way; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>they spoke against God and against Moses, and said, &#8220;Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? There is no bread! There is no water! And we detest this miserable food!&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then the <span class="name">Lord</span> sent venomous snakes among them; they bit the people and many Israelites died.
