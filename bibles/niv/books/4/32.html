<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So they came to Moses and Eleazar the priest and to the leaders of the community, and said,

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Moses said to the Gadites and Reubenites, &#8220;Should your fellow Israelites go to war while you sit here? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Why do you discourage the Israelites from crossing over into the land the <span class="name">Lord</span> has given them? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>This is what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to look over the land.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>not one except Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua son of Nun, for they followed the <span class="name">Lord</span> wholeheartedly.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s anger burned against Israel and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until the whole generation of those who had done evil in his sight was gone.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>&#8220;And here you are, a brood of sinners, standing in the place of your fathers and making the <span class="name">Lord</span> even more angry with Israel.

 and go ahead of the Israelites until we have brought them to their place. Meanwhile our women and children will live in fortified cities, for protection from the inhabitants of the land.
