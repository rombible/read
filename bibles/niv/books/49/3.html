<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Surely you have heard about the administration of God&#8217;s grace that was given to me for you, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>that is, the mystery made known to me by revelation, as I have already written briefly. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>In reading this, then, you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>which was not made known to people in other generations as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to God&#8217;s holy apostles and prophets. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>This mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are heirs together with Israel, members together of one body, and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God&#8217;s grace given me through the working of his power. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Although I am less than the least of all the Lord&#8217;s people, this grace was given me: to preach to the Gentiles the boundless riches of Christ, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and to make plain to everyone the administration of this mystery, which for ages past was kept hidden in God, who created all things. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>His intent was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>according to his eternal purpose that he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>In him and through faith in him we may approach God with freedom and confidence. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>I ask you, therefore, not to be discouraged because of my sufferings for you, which are your glory.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">A Prayer for the Ephesians</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For this reason I kneel before the Father, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>from whom every family
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="The Greek for family (patria) is derived from the Greek for father (pater).">a</a></sup></span>
 in heaven and on earth derives its name. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>may have power, together with all the Lord&#8217;s holy people, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>and to know this love that surpasses knowledge&#8212;that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever!
