<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in those who are disobedient.

 and following its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature deserving of wrath. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions&#8212;it is by grace you have been saved. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his grace, expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith&#8212;and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God&#8212;

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For we are God&#8217;s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Jew and Gentile Reconciled Through Christ</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Therefore, remember that formerly you who are Gentiles by birth and called &#8220;uncircumcised&#8221; by those who call themselves &#8220;the circumcision&#8221; (which is done in the body by human hands)&#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>remember that at that time you were separate from Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise, without hope and without God in the world. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>by setting aside in his flesh the law with its commands and regulations. His purpose was to create in himself one new humanity out of the two, thus making peace, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>and in one body to reconcile both of them to God through the cross, by which he put to death their hostility. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>He came and preached peace to you who were far away and peace to those who were near.
