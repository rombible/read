<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>He prayed to the <span class="name">Lord</span>, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t this what I said, <span class="name">Lord</span>, when I was still at home? That is what I tried to forestall by fleeing to Tarshish. I knew that you are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger and abounding in love, a God who relents from sending calamity. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Now, <span class="name">Lord</span>, take away my life, for it is better for me to die than to live.&#8221;</p>

 and made it grow up over Jonah to give shade for his head to ease his discomfort, and Jonah was very happy about the plant. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But at dawn the next day God provided a worm, which chewed the plant so that it withered. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>When the sun rose, God provided a scorching east wind, and the sun blazed on Jonah&#8217;s head so that he grew faint. He wanted to die, and said, &#8220;It would be better for me to die than to live.&#8221;</p>
