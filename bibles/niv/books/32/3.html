<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Go to the great city of Nineveh and proclaim to it the message I give you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Jonah obeyed the word of the <span class="name">Lord</span> and went to Nineveh. Now Nineveh was a very large city; it took three days to go through it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Jonah began by going a day&#8217;s journey into the city, proclaiming, &#8220;Forty more days and Nineveh will be overthrown.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>The Ninevites believed God. A fast was proclaimed, and all of them, from the greatest to the least, put on sackcloth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>When Jonah&#8217;s warning reached the king of Nineveh, he rose from his throne, took off his royal robes, covered himself with sackcloth and sat down in the dust. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>This is the proclamation he issued in Nineveh:</p><p class="introduction">&#8220;By the decree of the king and his nobles:</p><p class="emb">Do not let people or animals, herds or flocks, taste anything; do not let them eat or drink. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But let people and animals be covered with sackcloth. Let everyone call urgently on God. Let them give up their evil ways and their violence. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Who knows? God may yet relent and with compassion turn from his fierce anger so that we will not perish.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>When God saw what they did and how they turned from their evil ways, he relented and did not bring on them the destruction he had threatened.</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
