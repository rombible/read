<p class="sectionhead">Hebrew Servants</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;If you buy a Hebrew servant, he is to serve you for six years. But in the seventh year, he shall go free, without paying anything. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>If he comes alone, he is to go free alone; but if he has a wife when he comes, she is to go with him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the woman and her children shall belong to her master, and only the man shall go free.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8220;But if the servant declares, &#8216;I love my master and my wife and children and do not want to go free,&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>then his master must take him before the judges.
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or before God">a</a></sup></span>
 He shall take him to the door or the doorpost and pierce his ear with an awl. Then he will be his servant for life.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8220;If a man sells his daughter as a servant, she is not to go free as male servants do. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>If she does not please the master who has selected her for himself,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or master so that he does not choose her">b</a></sup></span>
 he must let her be redeemed. He has no right to sell her to foreigners, because he has broken faith with her. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>If he selects her for his son, he must grant her the rights of a daughter. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>If he marries another woman, he must not deprive the first one of her food, clothing and marital rights. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>If he does not provide her with these three things, she is to go free, without any payment of money.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Personal Injuries</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>&#8220;Anyone who strikes a person with a fatal blow is to be put to death. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>However, if it is not done intentionally, but God lets it happen, they are to flee to a place I will designate. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But if anyone schemes and kills someone deliberately, that person is to be taken from my altar and put to death.</p>

 their father or mother is to be put to death.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>&#8220;Anyone who kidnaps someone is to be put to death, whether the victim has been sold or is still in the kidnapper&#8217;s possession.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>&#8220;Anyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>&#8220;If people quarrel and one person hits another with a stone or with their fist

 and the victim does not die but is confined to bed, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>the one who struck the blow will not be held liable if the other can get up and walk around outside with a staff; however, the guilty party must pay the injured person for any loss of time and see that the victim is completely healed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>&#8220;Anyone who beats their male or female slave with a rod must be punished if the slave dies as a direct result, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>but they are not to be punished if the slave recovers after a day or two, since the slave is their property.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>&#8220;If a bull gores a man or woman to death, the bull is to be stoned to death, and its meat must not be eaten. But the owner of the bull will not be held responsible.
