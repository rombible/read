<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And I will harden Pharaoh&#8217;s heart, and he will pursue them.

 and troops&#8212;pursued the Israelites and overtook them as they camped by the sea near Pi Hahiroth, opposite Baal Zephon.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>As Pharaoh approached, the Israelites looked up, and there were the Egyptians, marching after them. They were terrified and cried out to the <span class="name">Lord</span>. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>They said to Moses, &#8220;Was it because there were no graves in Egypt that you brought us to the desert to die? What have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt?

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Moses answered the people, &#8220;Do not be afraid.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> will fight for you; you need only to be still.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then the <span class="name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;Why are you crying out to me? Tell the Israelites to move on. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Raise your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea to divide the water so that the Israelites can go through the sea on dry ground.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and all that night the <span class="name">Lord</span> drove the sea back with a strong east wind and turned it into dry land.
