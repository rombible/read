<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>After they set out from Rephidim, they entered the Desert of Sinai, and Israel camped there in the desert in front of the mountain.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then Moses went up to God, and the <span class="name">Lord</span> called to him from the mountain and said, &#8220;This is what you are to say to the descendants of Jacob and what you are to tell the people of Israel: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8216;You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt, and how I carried you on eagles&#8217; wings and brought you to myself. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now if you obey me fully and keep my covenant, then out of all nations you will be my treasured possession. Although the whole earth is mine, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>you
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or possession, for the whole earth is mine. 6 You">a</a></sup></span>
 will be for me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.&#8217; These are the words you are to speak to the Israelites.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So Moses went back and summoned the elders of the people and set before them all the words the <span class="name">Lord</span> had commanded him to speak. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>The people all responded together, &#8220;We will do everything the <span class="name">Lord</span> has said.&#8221; So Moses brought their answer back to the <span class="name">Lord</span>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;I am going to come to you in a dense cloud, so that the people will hear me speaking with you and will always put their trust in you.&#8221; Then Moses told the <span class="name">Lord</span> what the people had said.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And the <span class="name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow. Have them wash their clothes 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>and be ready by the third day, because on that day the <span class="name">Lord</span> will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Put limits for the people around the mountain and tell them, &#8216;Be careful that you do not approach the mountain or touch the foot of it. Whoever touches the mountain is to be put to death. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>They are to be stoned or shot with arrows; not a hand is to be laid on them. No person or animal shall be permitted to live.&#8217; Only when the ram&#8217;s horn sounds a long blast may they approach the mountain.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>After Moses had gone down the mountain to the people, he consecrated them, and they washed their clothes. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then he said to the people, &#8220;Prepare yourselves for the third day. Abstain from sexual relations.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>On the morning of the third day there was thunder and lightning, with a thick cloud over the mountain, and a very loud trumpet blast. Everyone in the camp trembled. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then Moses led the people out of the camp to meet with God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Mount Sinai was covered with smoke, because the <span class="name">Lord</span> descended on it in fire. The smoke billowed up from it like smoke from a furnace, and the whole mountain

 trembled violently. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>As the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke and the voice of God answered him.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Even the priests, who approach the <span class="name">Lord</span>, must consecrate themselves, or the <span class="name">Lord</span> will break out against them.&#8221;</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> replied, &#8220;Go down and bring Aaron up with you.
