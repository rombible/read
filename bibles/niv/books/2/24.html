You are to worship at a distance, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>but Moses alone is to approach the <span class="name">Lord</span>; the others must not come near. And the people may not come up with him.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>When Moses went and told the people all the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s words and laws, they responded with one voice, &#8220;Everything the <span class="name">Lord</span> has said we will do.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Moses then wrote down everything the <span class="name">Lord</span> had said.</p><p class="reg">He got up early the next morning and built an altar at the foot of the mountain and set up twelve stone pillars representing the twelve tribes of Israel. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then he sent young Israelite men, and they offered burnt offerings and sacrificed young bulls as fellowship offerings to the <span class="name">Lord</span>. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Moses took half of the blood and put it in bowls, and the other half he splashed against the altar. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then he took the Book of the Covenant and read it to the people. They responded, &#8220;We will do everything the <span class="name">Lord</span> has said; we will obey.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Moses then took the blood, sprinkled it on the people and said, &#8220;This is the blood of the covenant that the <span class="name">Lord</span> has made with you in accordance with all these words.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and the seventy elders of Israel went up 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and saw the God of Israel. Under his feet was something like a pavement made of lapis lazuli, as bright blue as the sky. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But God did not raise his hand against these leaders of the Israelites; they saw God, and they ate and drank.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;Come up to me on the mountain and stay here, and I will give you the tablets of stone with the law and commandments I have written for their instruction.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then Moses set out with Joshua his aide, and Moses went up on the mountain of God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>He said to the elders, &#8220;Wait here for us until we come back to you. Aaron and Hur are with you, and anyone involved in a dispute can go to them.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>When Moses went up on the mountain, the cloud covered it, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>and the glory of the <span class="name">Lord</span> settled on Mount Sinai. For six days the cloud covered the mountain, and on the seventh day the <span class="name">Lord</span> called to Moses from within the cloud. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>To the Israelites the glory of the <span class="name">Lord</span> looked like a consuming fire on top of the mountain.
