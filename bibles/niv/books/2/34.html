<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Be ready in the morning, and then come up on Mount Sinai. Present yourself to me there on top of the mountain. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>No one is to come with you or be seen anywhere on the mountain; not even the flocks and herds may graze in front of the mountain.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So Moses chiseled out two stone tablets like the first ones and went up Mount Sinai early in the morning, as the <span class="name">Lord</span> had commanded him; and he carried the two stone tablets in his hands. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then the <span class="name">Lord</span> came down in the cloud and stood there with him and proclaimed his name, the <span class="name">Lord</span>. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And he passed in front of Moses, proclaiming, &#8220;The <span class="name">Lord</span>, the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children and their children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Moses bowed to the ground at once and worshiped. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;Lord,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if I have found favor in your eyes, then let the Lord go with us. Although this is a stiff-necked people, forgive our wickedness and our sin, and take us as your inheritance.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then the <span class="name">Lord</span> said: &#8220;I am making a covenant with you. Before all your people I will do wonders never before done in any nation in all the world. The people you live among will see how awesome is the work that I, the <span class="name">Lord</span>, will do for you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Obey what I command you today. I will drive out before you the Amorites, Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.
