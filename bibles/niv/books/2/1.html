 in all; Joseph was already in Egypt.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>but the Israelites were exceedingly fruitful; they multiplied greatly, increased in numbers and became so numerous that the land was filled with them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then a new king, to whom Joseph meant nothing, came to power in Egypt. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;Look,&#8221; he said to his people, &#8220;the Israelites have become far too numerous for us. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Come, we must deal shrewdly with them or they will become even more numerous and, if war breaks out, will join our enemies, fight against us and leave the country.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So they put slave masters over them to oppress them with forced labor, and they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread; so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>and worked them ruthlessly. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>They made their lives bitter with harsh labor in brick and mortar and with all kinds of work in the fields; in all their harsh labor the Egyptians worked them ruthlessly.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>&#8220;When you are helping the Hebrew women during childbirth on the delivery stool, if you see that the baby is a boy, kill him; but if it is a girl, let her live.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>The midwives, however, feared God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them to do; they let the boys live. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, &#8220;Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>The midwives answered Pharaoh, &#8220;Hebrew women are not like Egyptian women; they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives arrive.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So God was kind to the midwives and the people increased and became even more numerous. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families of their own.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then Pharaoh gave this order to all his people: &#8220;Every Hebrew boy that is born you must throw into the Nile, but let every girl live.&#8221;</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><A name="footnotes"></a><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotebot">Masoretic Text (see also Gen. 46:27); Dead Sea Scrolls and Septuagint (see also Acts 7:14 and note at Gen. 46:27) <i>seventy-five</i></span><br><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
