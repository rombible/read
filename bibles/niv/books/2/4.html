<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then the <span class="name">Lord</span> said to him, &#8220;What is that in your hand?&#8221;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;A staff,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> said, &#8220;Throw it on the ground.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">Moses threw it on the ground and it became a snake, and he ran from it.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8220;This,&#8221; said the <span class="name">Lord</span>, &#8220;is so that they may believe that the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the God of their fathers&#8212;the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob&#8212;has appeared to you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then the <span class="name">Lord</span> said, &#8220;Put your hand inside your cloak.&#8221; So Moses put his hand into his cloak, and when he took it out, the skin was leprous

&#8212;it had become as white as snow.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8220;Now put it back into your cloak,&#8221; he said. So Moses put his hand back into his cloak, and when he took it out, it was restored, like the rest of his flesh.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then the <span class="name">Lord</span> said, &#8220;If they do not believe you or pay attention to the first sign, they may believe the second. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But if they do not believe these two signs or listen to you, take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground. The water you take from the river will become blood on the ground.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Moses said to the <span class="name">Lord</span>, &#8220;Pardon your servant, Lord.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> said to him, &#8220;Who gave human beings their mouths?

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now go; I will help you speak and will teach you what to say.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>But Moses said, &#8220;Pardon your servant, Lord. Please send someone else.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s anger burned against Moses and he said, &#8220;What about your brother, Aaron the Levite?

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>You shall speak to him and put words in his mouth; I will help both of you speak and will teach you what to do.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Now the <span class="name">Lord</span> had said to Moses in Midian, &#8220;Go back to Egypt, for all those who wanted to kill you are dead.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So Moses took his wife and sons, put them on a donkey and started back to Egypt. And he took the staff of God in his hand.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then say to Pharaoh, &#8216;This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> says: Israel is my firstborn son,
