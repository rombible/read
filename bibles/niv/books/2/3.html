<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>There the angel of the <span class="name">Lord</span> appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush. Moses saw that though the bush was on fire it did not burn up. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So Moses thought, &#8220;I will go over and see this strange sight&#8212;why the bush does not burn up.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>When the <span class="name">Lord</span> saw that he had gone over to look, God called to him from within the bush, &#8220;Moses!

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8220;Do not come any closer,&#8221; God said. &#8220;Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then he said, &#8220;I am the God of your father,

 the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.&#8221; At this, Moses hid his face, because he was afraid to look at God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> said, &#8220;I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So I have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey&#8212;the home of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And now the cry of the Israelites has reached me, and I have seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing them.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But Moses said to God, &#8220;Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?&#8221;</p>
