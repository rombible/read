<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then Moses summoned Bezalel and Oholiab and every skilled person to whom the <span class="name">Lord</span> had given ability and who was willing to come and do the work. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>They received from Moses all the offerings the Israelites had brought to carry out the work of constructing the sanctuary. And the people continued to bring freewill offerings morning after morning. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So all the skilled workers who were doing all the work on the sanctuary left what they were doing 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and said to Moses, &#8220;The people are bringing more than enough for doing the work the <span class="name">Lord</span> commanded to be done.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then Moses gave an order and they sent this word throughout the camp: &#8220;No man or woman is to make anything else as an offering for the sanctuary.&#8221; And so the people were restrained from bringing more, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>because what they already had was more than enough to do all the work.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">The Tabernacle</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>All those who were skilled among the workers made the tabernacle with ten curtains of finely twisted linen and blue, purple and scarlet yarn, with cherubim woven into them by expert hands. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>All the curtains were the same size&#8212;twenty-eight cubits long and four cubits wide.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then they made loops of blue material along the edge of the end curtain in one set, and the same was done with the end curtain in the other set. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>They also made fifty loops on one curtain and fifty loops on the end curtain of the other set, with the loops opposite each other. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then they made fifty gold clasps and used them to fasten the two sets of curtains together so that the tabernacle was a unit.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>They made curtains of goat hair for the tent over the tabernacle&#8212;eleven altogether.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>They made upright frames of acacia wood for the tabernacle.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>They made twenty frames for the south side of the tabernacle 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>and made forty silver bases to go under them&#8212;two bases for each frame, one under each projection. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>For the other side, the north side of the tabernacle, they made twenty frames

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/36-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>They made six frames for the far end, that is, the west end of the tabernacle,
