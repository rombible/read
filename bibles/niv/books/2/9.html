<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So they took soot from a furnace and stood before Pharaoh. Moses tossed it into the air, and festering boils broke out on people and animals.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Throughout Egypt hail struck everything in the fields&#8212;both people and animals; it beat down everything growing in the fields and stripped every tree.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Pray to the <span class="name">Lord</span>, for we have had enough thunder and hail. I will let you go; you don&#8217;t have to stay any longer.&#8221;</p>
