<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>After Moses had sent away his wife Zipporah, his father-in-law Jethro received her 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and her two sons. One son was named Gershom,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Gershom sounds like the Hebrew for a foreigner there.">a</a></sup></span>
 for Moses said, &#8220;I have become a foreigner in a foreign land&#8221;; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and the other was named Eliezer,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Eliezer means my God is helper.">b</a></sup></span>
 for he said, &#8220;My father&#8217;s God was my helper; he saved me from the sword of Pharaoh.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Jethro, Moses&#8217; father-in-law, together with Moses&#8217; sons and wife, came to him in the wilderness, where he was camped near the mountain of God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Jethro had sent word to him, &#8220;I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So Moses went out to meet his father-in-law and bowed down and kissed him. They greeted each other and then went into the tent. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Moses told his father-in-law about everything the <span class="name">Lord</span> had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Israel&#8217;s sake and about all the hardships they had met along the way and how the <span class="name">Lord</span> had saved them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Jethro was delighted to hear about all the good things the <span class="name">Lord</span> had done for Israel in rescuing them from the hand of the Egyptians. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>He said, &#8220;Praise be to the <span class="name">Lord</span>, who rescued you from the hand of the Egyptians and of Pharaoh, and who rescued the people from the hand of the Egyptians. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now I know that the <span class="name">Lord</span> is greater than all other gods, for he did this to those who had treated Israel arrogantly.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then Jethro, Moses&#8217; father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and other sacrifices to God, and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat a meal with Moses&#8217; father-in-law in the presence of God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>The next day Moses took his seat to serve as judge for the people, and they stood around him from morning till evening. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>When his father-in-law saw all that Moses was doing for the people, he said, &#8220;What is this you are doing for the people? Why do you alone sit as judge, while all these people stand around you from morning till evening?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Moses answered him, &#8220;Because the people come to me to seek God&#8217;s will. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Whenever they have a dispute, it is brought to me, and I decide between the parties and inform them of God&#8217;s decrees and instructions.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Moses&#8217; father-in-law replied, &#8220;What you are doing is not good. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>You and these people who come to you will only wear yourselves out. The work is too heavy for you; you cannot handle it alone. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Listen now to me and I will give you some advice, and may God be with you. You must be the people&#8217;s representative before God and bring their disputes to him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Teach them his decrees and instructions, and show them the way they are to live and how they are to behave. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>But select capable men from all the people&#8212;men who fear God, trustworthy men who hate dishonest gain&#8212;and appoint them as officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Have them serve as judges for the people at all times, but have them bring every difficult case to you; the simple cases they can decide themselves. That will make your load lighter, because they will share it with you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>If you do this and God so commands, you will be able to stand the strain, and all these people will go home satisfied.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Moses listened to his father-in-law and did everything he said. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>He chose capable men from all Israel and made them leaders of the people, officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>They served as judges for the people at all times. The difficult cases they brought to Moses, but the simple ones they decided themselves.</p>
