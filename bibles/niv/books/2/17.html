They camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/17-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So they quarreled with Moses and said, &#8220;Give us water to drink.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">Moses replied, &#8220;Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you put the <span class="name">Lord</span> to the test?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/17-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But the people were thirsty for water there, and they grumbled against Moses. They said, &#8220;Why did you bring us up out of Egypt to make us and our children and livestock die of thirst?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/17-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then Moses cried out to the <span class="name">Lord</span>, &#8220;What am I to do with these people? They are almost ready to stone me.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/17-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> answered Moses, &#8220;Go out in front of the people. Take with you some of the elders of Israel and take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile, and go. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/17-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>I will stand there before you by the rock at Horeb. Strike the rock, and water will come out of it for the people to drink.&#8221; So Moses did this in the sight of the elders of Israel. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/17-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And he called the place Massah
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Massah means testing.">a</a></sup></span>
 and Meribah
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Meribah means quarreling.">b</a></sup></span>
 because the Israelites quarreled and because they tested the <span class="name">Lord</span> saying, &#8220;Is the <span class="name">Lord</span> among us or not?&#8221;</p>
<p class="sectionhead">The Amalekites Defeated</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/17-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>The Amalekites came and attacked the Israelites at Rephidim. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/17-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Moses said to Joshua, &#8220;Choose some of our men and go out to fight the Amalekites. Tomorrow I will stand on top of the hill with the staff of God in my hands.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/17-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So Joshua fought the Amalekites as Moses had ordered, and Moses, Aaron and Hur went to the top of the hill. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/17-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>As long as Moses held up his hands, the Israelites were winning, but whenever he lowered his hands, the Amalekites were winning. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/17-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>When Moses&#8217; hands grew tired, they took a stone and put it under him and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held his hands up&#8212;one on one side, one on the other&#8212;so that his hands remained steady till sunset. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/17-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So Joshua overcame the Amalekite army with the sword.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/17-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then the <span class="name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;Write this on a scroll as something to be remembered and make sure that Joshua hears it, because I will completely blot out the name of Amalek from under heaven.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/17-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Moses built an altar and called it The <span class="name">Lord</span> is my Banner.
