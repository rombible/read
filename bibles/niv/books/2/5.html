<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Pharaoh said, &#8220;Who is the <span class="name">Lord</span>, that I should obey him and let Israel go? I do not know the <span class="name">Lord</span> and I will not let Israel go.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then they said, &#8220;The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Now let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the <span class="name">Lord</span> our God, or he may strike us with plagues or with the sword.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But the king of Egypt said, &#8220;Moses and Aaron, why are you taking the people away from their labor? Get back to your work!&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then Pharaoh said, &#8220;Look, the people of the land are now numerous, and you are stopping them from working.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>That same day Pharaoh gave this order to the slave drivers and overseers in charge of the people: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8220;You are no longer to supply the people with straw for making bricks; let them go and gather their own straw. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But require them to make the same number of bricks as before; don&#8217;t reduce the quota. They are lazy; that is why they are crying out, &#8216;Let us go and sacrifice to our God.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Make the work harder for the people so that they keep working and pay no attention to lies.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then the slave drivers and the overseers went out and said to the people, &#8220;This is what Pharaoh says: &#8216;I will not give you any more straw. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Go and get your own straw wherever you can find it, but your work will not be reduced at all.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So the people scattered all over Egypt to gather stubble to use for straw. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>The slave drivers kept pressing them, saying, &#8220;Complete the work required of you for each day, just as when you had straw.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And Pharaoh&#8217;s slave drivers beat the Israelite overseers they had appointed, demanding, &#8220;Why haven&#8217;t you met your quota of bricks yesterday or today, as before?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then the Israelite overseers went and appealed to Pharaoh: &#8220;Why have you treated your servants this way? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Your servants are given no straw, yet we are told, &#8216;Make bricks!&#8217; Your servants are being beaten, but the fault is with your own people.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Pharaoh said, &#8220;Lazy, that&#8217;s what you are&#8212;lazy! That is why you keep saying, &#8216;Let us go and sacrifice to the <span class="name">Lord</span>.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Now get to work. You will not be given any straw, yet you must produce your full quota of bricks.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>The Israelite overseers realized they were in trouble when they were told, &#8220;You are not to reduce the number of bricks required of you for each day.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>When they left Pharaoh, they found Moses and Aaron waiting to meet them, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>and they said, &#8220;May the <span class="name">Lord</span> look on you and judge you! You have made us obnoxious to Pharaoh and his officials and have put a sword in their hand to kill us.&#8221;</p>
<p class="sectionhead">God Promises Deliverance</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Moses returned to the <span class="name">Lord</span> and said, &#8220;Why, Lord, why have you brought trouble on this people? Is this why you sent me? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/5-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Ever since I went to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble on this people, and you have not rescued your people at all.&#8221;</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
