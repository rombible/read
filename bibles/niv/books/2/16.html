<div class="chap"><p class="sectionhead">Manna and Quail</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>The whole Israelite community set out from Elim and came to the Desert of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after they had come out of Egypt. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>In the desert the whole community grumbled against Moses and Aaron. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>The Israelites said to them, &#8220;If only we had died by the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s hand in Egypt! There we sat around pots of meat and ate all the food we wanted, but you have brought us out into this desert to starve this entire assembly to death.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then the <span class="name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;I will rain down bread from heaven for you. The people are to go out each day and gather enough for that day. In this way I will test them and see whether they will follow my instructions. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>On the sixth day they are to prepare what they bring in, and that is to be twice as much as they gather on the other days.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites, &#8220;In the evening you will know that it was the <span class="name">Lord</span> who brought you out of Egypt, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and in the morning you will see the glory of the <span class="name">Lord</span>, because he has heard your grumbling against him. Who are we, that you should grumble against us?&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Moses also said, &#8220;You will know that it was the <span class="name">Lord</span> when he gives you meat to eat in the evening and all the bread you want in the morning, because he has heard your grumbling against him. Who are we? You are not grumbling against us, but against the <span class="name">Lord</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then Moses told Aaron, &#8220;Say to the entire Israelite community, &#8216;Come before the <span class="name">Lord</span>, for he has heard your grumbling.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>While Aaron was speaking to the whole Israelite community, they looked toward the desert, and there was the glory of the <span class="name">Lord</span> appearing in the cloud.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> said to Moses, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>&#8220;I have heard the grumbling of the Israelites. Tell them, &#8216;At twilight you will eat meat, and in the morning you will be filled with bread. Then you will know that I am the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>That evening quail came and covered the camp, and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>When the dew was gone, thin flakes like frost on the ground appeared on the desert floor. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>When the Israelites saw it, they said to each other, &#8220;What is it?&#8221; For they did not know what it was.</p><p class="reg">Moses said to them, &#8220;It is the bread the <span class="name">Lord</span> has given you to eat. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> has commanded: &#8216;Everyone is to gather as much as they need. Take an omer
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, possibly about 3 pounds or about 1.4 kilograms; also in verses 18, 32, 33 and 36">a</a></sup></span>
 for each person you have in your tent.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>The Israelites did as they were told; some gathered much, some little. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And when they measured it by the omer, the one who gathered much did not have too much, and the one who gathered little did not have too little. Everyone had gathered just as much as they needed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then Moses said to them, &#8220;No one is to keep any of it until morning.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>However, some of them paid no attention to Moses; they kept part of it until morning, but it was full of maggots and began to smell. So Moses was angry with them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Each morning everyone gathered as much as they needed, and when the sun grew hot, it melted away. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>On the sixth day, they gathered twice as much&#8212;two omers
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, possibly about 6 pounds or about 2.8 kilograms">b</a></sup></span>
 for each person&#8212;and the leaders of the community came and reported this to Moses. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>He said to them, &#8220;This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> commanded: &#8216;Tomorrow is to be a day of sabbath rest, a holy sabbath to the <span class="name">Lord</span>. So bake what you want to bake and boil what you want to boil. Save whatever is left and keep it until morning.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>So they saved it until morning, as Moses commanded, and it did not stink or get maggots in it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>&#8220;Eat it today,&#8221; Moses said, &#8220;because today is a sabbath to the <span class="name">Lord</span>. You will not find any of it on the ground today. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Six days you are to gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will not be any.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Nevertheless, some of the people went out on the seventh day to gather it, but they found none. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then the <span class="name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;How long will you
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="The Hebrew is plural.">c</a></sup></span>
 refuse to keep my commands and my instructions? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Bear in mind that the <span class="name">Lord</span> has given you the Sabbath; that is why on the sixth day he gives you bread for two days.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>So the people rested on the seventh day.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>The people of Israel called the bread manna.
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Manna sounds like the Hebrew for What is it? (see verse 15).">d</a></sup></span>
 It was white like coriander seed and tasted like wafers made with honey. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Moses said, &#8220;This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> has commanded: &#8216;Take an omer of manna and keep it for the generations to come, so they can see the bread I gave you to eat in the wilderness when I brought you out of Egypt.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>So Moses said to Aaron, &#8220;Take a jar and put an omer of manna in it. Then place it before the <span class="name">Lord</span> to be kept for the generations to come.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>As the <span class="name">Lord</span> commanded Moses, Aaron put the manna with the tablets of the covenant law, so that it might be preserved.
