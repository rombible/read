<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Do not follow the crowd in doing wrong. When you give testimony in a lawsuit, do not pervert justice by siding with the crowd, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and do not show favoritism to a poor person in a lawsuit.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8220;Do not accept a bribe, for a bribe blinds those who see and twists the words of the innocent.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;Do not oppress a foreigner; you yourselves know how it feels to be foreigners, because you were foreigners in Egypt.</p>
