<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>that you may tell your children and grandchildren how I dealt harshly with the Egyptians and how I performed my signs among them, and that you may know that I am the <span class="name">Lord</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said to him, &#8220;This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the God of the Hebrews, says: &#8216;How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me? Let my people go, so that they may worship me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>If you refuse to let them go, I will bring locusts into your country tomorrow. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>They will cover the face of the ground so that it cannot be seen. They will devour what little you have left after the hail, including every tree that is growing in your fields. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>They will fill your houses and those of all your officials and all the Egyptians&#8212;something neither your parents nor your ancestors have ever seen from the day they settled in this land till now.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221; Then Moses turned and left Pharaoh.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Pharaoh&#8217;s officials said to him, &#8220;How long will this man be a snare to us? Let the people go, so that they may worship the <span class="name">Lord</span> their God. Do you not yet realize that Egypt is ruined?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh. &#8220;Go, worship the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But tell me who will be going.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Moses answered, &#8220;We will go with our young and our old, with our sons and our daughters, and with our flocks and herds, because we are to celebrate a festival to the <span class="name">Lord</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Pharaoh said, &#8220;The <span class="name">Lord</span> be with you&#8212;if I let you go, along with your women and children! Clearly you are bent on evil.
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or Be careful, trouble is in store for you!">a</a></sup></span>
 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>No! Have only the men go and worship the <span class="name">Lord</span>, since that&#8217;s what you have been asking for.&#8221; Then Moses and Aaron were driven out of Pharaoh&#8217;s presence.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And the <span class="name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;Stretch out your hand over Egypt so that locusts swarm over the land and devour everything growing in the fields, everything left by the hail.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So Moses stretched out his staff over Egypt, and the <span class="name">Lord</span> made an east wind blow across the land all that day and all that night. By morning the wind had brought the locusts; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>they invaded all Egypt and settled down in every area of the country in great numbers. Never before had there been such a plague of locusts, nor will there ever be again. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>They covered all the ground until it was black. They devoured all that was left after the hail&#8212;everything growing in the fields and the fruit on the trees. Nothing green remained on tree or plant in all the land of Egypt.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Pharaoh quickly summoned Moses and Aaron and said, &#8220;I have sinned against the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God and against you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Now forgive my sin once more and pray to the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God to take this deadly plague away from me.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Moses then left Pharaoh and prayed to the <span class="name">Lord</span>. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>And the <span class="name">Lord</span> changed the wind to a very strong west wind, which caught up the locusts and carried them into the Red Sea.
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or the Sea of Reeds">b</a></sup></span>
 Not a locust was left anywhere in Egypt. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>But the <span class="name">Lord</span> hardened Pharaoh&#8217;s heart, and he would not let the Israelites go.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">The Plague of Darkness</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then the <span class="name">Lord</span> said to Moses, &#8220;Stretch out your hand toward the sky so that darkness spreads over Egypt&#8212;darkness that can be felt.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>So Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and total darkness covered all Egypt for three days. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>No one could see anyone else or move about for three days. Yet all the Israelites had light in the places where they lived.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and said, &#8220;Go, worship the <span class="name">Lord</span>. Even your women and children may go with you; only leave your flocks and herds behind.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>But Moses said, &#8220;You must allow us to have sacrifices and burnt offerings to present to the <span class="name">Lord</span> our God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Our livestock too must go with us; not a hoof is to be left behind.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>But the <span class="name">Lord</span> hardened Pharaoh&#8217;s heart, and he was not willing to let them go.
