<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Moses did everything just as the <span class="name">Lord</span> commanded him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So the tabernacle was set up on the first day of the first month in the second year. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>When Moses set up the tabernacle, he put the bases in place, erected the frames, inserted the crossbars and set up the posts. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then he spread the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering over the tent, as the <span class="name">Lord</span> commanded him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>He took the tablets of the covenant law and placed them in the ark, attached the poles to the ark and put the atonement cover over it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then he brought the ark into the tabernacle and hung the shielding curtain and shielded the ark of the covenant law, as the <span class="name">Lord</span> commanded him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Moses placed the table in the tent of meeting on the north side of the tabernacle outside the curtain

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>He placed the lampstand in the tent of meeting opposite the table on the south side of the tabernacle 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>and set up the lamps before the <span class="name">Lord</span>, as the <span class="name">Lord</span> commanded him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Moses placed the gold altar in the tent of meeting in front of the curtain 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>and burned fragrant incense on it, as the <span class="name">Lord</span> commanded him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then he put up the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>He set the altar of burnt offering near the entrance to the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, and offered on it burnt offerings and grain offerings, as the <span class="name">Lord</span> commanded him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>He placed the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it for washing, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>and Moses and Aaron and his sons used it to wash their hands and feet. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>They washed whenever they entered the tent of meeting or approached the altar, as the <span class="name">Lord</span> commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Then Moses set up the courtyard around the tabernacle and altar and put up the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard. And so Moses finished the work.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Moses could not enter the tent of meeting because the cloud had settled on it, and the glory of the <span class="name">Lord</span> filled the tabernacle.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>In all the travels of the Israelites, whenever the cloud lifted from above the tabernacle, they would set out;
