<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>He put the tunic on Aaron, tied the sash around him, clothed him with the robe and put the ephod on him. He also fastened the ephod with a decorative waistband, which he tied around him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>He placed the breastpiece on him and put the Urim and Thummim in the breastpiece.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and everything in it, and so consecrated them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>He sprinkled some of the oil on the altar seven times, anointing the altar and all its utensils and the basin with its stand, to consecrate them.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Moses also took all the fat around the internal organs, the long lobe of the liver, and both kidneys and their fat, and burned it on the altar. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But the bull with its hide and its flesh and its intestines he burned up outside the camp, as the <span class="name">Lord</span> commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>He then presented the ram for the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>And from the basket of bread made without yeast, which was before the <span class="name">Lord</span>, he took one thick loaf, one thick loaf with olive oil mixed in, and one thin loaf, and he put these on the fat portions and on the right thigh. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>He put all these in the hands of Aaron and his sons, and they waved them before the <span class="name">Lord</span> as a wave offering. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Then Moses took them from their hands and burned them on the altar on top of the burnt offering as an ordination offering, a pleasing aroma, a food offering presented to the <span class="name">Lord</span>. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Moses also took the breast, which was his share of the ordination ram, and waved it before the <span class="name">Lord</span> as a wave offering, as the <span class="name">Lord</span> commanded Moses.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Moses then said to Aaron and his sons, &#8220;Cook the meat at the entrance to the tent of meeting and eat it there with the bread from the basket of ordination offerings, as I was commanded: &#8216;Aaron and his sons are to eat it.&#8217;

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Do not leave the entrance to the tent of meeting for seven days, until the days of your ordination are completed, for your ordination will last seven days.
