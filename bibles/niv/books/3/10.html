<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So fire came out from the presence of the <span class="name">Lord</span> and consumed them, and they died before the <span class="name">Lord</span>.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So they came and carried them, still in their tunics, outside the camp, as Moses ordered.</p>

 and do not tear your clothes, or you will die and the <span class="name">Lord</span> will be angry with the whole community. But your relatives, all the Israelites, may mourn for those the <span class="name">Lord</span> has destroyed by fire.
