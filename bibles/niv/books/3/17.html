<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Speak to Aaron and his sons and to all the Israelites and say to them: &#8216;This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> has commanded: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Any Israelite who sacrifices an ox,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="The Hebrew word can refer to either male or female.">a</a></sup></span>
 a lamb or a goat in the camp or outside of it 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>instead of bringing it to the entrance to the tent of meeting to present it as an offering to the <span class="name">Lord</span> in front of the tabernacle of the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8212;that person shall be considered guilty of bloodshed; they have shed blood and must be cut off from their people. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>This is so the Israelites will bring to the <span class="name">Lord</span> the sacrifices they are now making in the open fields. They must bring them to the priest, that is, to the <span class="name">Lord</span>, at the entrance to the tent of meeting and sacrifice them as fellowship offerings. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>The priest is to splash the blood against the altar of the <span class="name">Lord</span> at the entrance to the tent of meeting and burn the fat as an aroma pleasing to the <span class="name">Lord</span>. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>They must no longer offer any of their sacrifices to the goat idols
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or the demons">b</a></sup></span>
 to whom they prostitute themselves. This is to be a lasting ordinance for them and for the generations to come.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8220;Say to them: &#8216;Any Israelite or any foreigner residing among them who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;I will set my face against any Israelite or any foreigner residing among them who eats blood, and I will cut them off from the people.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Therefore I say to the Israelites, &#8220;None of you may eat blood, nor may any foreigner residing among you eat blood.&#8221;</p>
