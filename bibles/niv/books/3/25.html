<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For six years sow your fields, and for six years prune your vineyards and gather their crops.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>The fiftieth year shall be a jubilee for you; do not sow and do not reap what grows of itself or harvest the untended vines. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>For it is a jubilee and is to be holy for you; eat only what is taken directly from the fields.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>You are to buy from your own people on the basis of the number of years since the Jubilee. And they are to sell to you on the basis of the number of years left for harvesting crops. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>When the years are many, you are to increase the price, and when the years are few, you are to decrease the price, because what is really being sold to you is the number of crops.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>I will send you such a blessing in the sixth year that the land will yield enough for three years. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>While you plant during the eighth year, you will eat from the old crop and will continue to eat from it until the harvest of the ninth year comes in.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;The land must not be sold permanently, because the land is mine and you reside in my land as foreigners and strangers.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>If, however, there is no one to redeem it for them but later on they prosper and acquire sufficient means to redeem it themselves,

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>But if they do not acquire the means to repay, what was sold will remain in the possession of the buyer until the Year of Jubilee.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>But houses in villages without walls around them are to be considered as belonging to the open country. They can be redeemed, and they are to be returned in the Jubilee.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>But the pastureland belonging to their towns must not be sold; it is their permanent possession.</p>
