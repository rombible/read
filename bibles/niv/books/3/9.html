 and a ram for your burnt offering, both without defect, and present them before the <span class="name">Lord</span>. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then say to the Israelites: &#8216;Take a male goat for a sin offering, a calf and a lamb&#8212;both a year old and without defect&#8212;for a burnt offering,

 and a ram for a fellowship offering to sacrifice before the <span class="name">Lord</span>, together with a grain offering mixed with olive oil. For today the <span class="name">Lord</span> will appear to you.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>They took the things Moses commanded to the front of the tent of meeting, and the entire assembly came near and stood before the <span class="name">Lord</span>. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then Moses said, &#8220;This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> has commanded you to do, so that the glory of the <span class="name">Lord</span> may appear to you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Moses said to Aaron, &#8220;Come to the altar and sacrifice your sin offering and your burnt offering and make atonement for yourself and the people; sacrifice the offering that is for the people and make atonement for them, as the <span class="name">Lord</span> has commanded.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So Aaron came to the altar and slaughtered the calf as a sin offering for himself. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>His sons brought the blood to him, and he dipped his finger into the blood and put it on the horns of the altar; the rest of the blood he poured out at the base of the altar. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>On the altar he burned the fat, the kidneys and the long lobe of the liver from the sin offering, as the <span class="name">Lord</span> commanded Moses;

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then he slaughtered the burnt offering. His sons handed him the blood, and he splashed it against the sides of the altar. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>They handed him the burnt offering piece by piece, including the head, and he burned them on the altar. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>He washed the internal organs and the legs and burned them on top of the burnt offering on the altar.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Aaron then brought the offering that was for the people. He took the goat for the people&#8217;s sin offering and slaughtered it and offered it for a sin offering as he did with the first one.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>He brought the burnt offering and offered it in the prescribed way. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>He also brought the grain offering, took a handful of it and burned it on the altar in addition to the morning&#8217;s burnt offering.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>He slaughtered the ox and the ram as the fellowship offering for the people. His sons handed him the blood, and he splashed it against the sides of the altar. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>But the fat portions of the ox and the ram&#8212;the fat tail, the layer of fat, the kidneys and the long lobe of the liver&#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>these they laid on the breasts, and then Aaron burned the fat on the altar. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Aaron waved the breasts and the right thigh before the <span class="name">Lord</span> as a wave offering, as Moses commanded.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then Aaron lifted his hands toward the people and blessed them. And having sacrificed the sin offering, the burnt offering and the fellowship offering, he stepped down.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Moses and Aaron then went into the tent of meeting. When they came out, they blessed the people; and the glory of the <span class="name">Lord</span> appeared to all the people.
