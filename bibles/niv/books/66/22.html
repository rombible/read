<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/22-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>down the middle of the great street of the city. On each side of the river stood the tree of life, bearing twelve crops of fruit, yielding its fruit every month. And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/22-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>No longer will there be any curse. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city, and his servants will serve him.
