 for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, &#8220;Look!

 or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>He who was seated on the throne said, &#8220;I am making everything new!&#8221; Then he said, &#8220;Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>He said to me: &#8220;It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To the thirsty I will give water without cost from the spring of the water of life. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Those who are victorious will inherit all this, and I will be their God and they will be my children. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars&#8212;they will be consigned to the fiery lake of burning sulfur.

<p class="sectionhead">The New Jerusalem, the Bride of the Lamb</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and said to me, &#8220;Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.&#8221;

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>It had a great, high wall with twelve gates, and with twelve angels at the gates. On the gates were written the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>There were three gates on the east, three on the north, three on the south and three on the west.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>The city was laid out like a square, as long as it was wide. He measured the city with the rod and found it to be 12,000 stadia
