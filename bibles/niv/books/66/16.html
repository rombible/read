<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/16-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>The first angel went and poured out his bowl on the land, and ugly, festering sores broke out on the people who had the mark of the beast and worshiped its image.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/16-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>The second angel poured out his bowl on the sea, and it turned into blood like that of a dead person, and every living thing in the sea died.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/16-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>The third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and springs of water, and they became blood. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/16-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then I heard the angel in charge of the waters say:</p><div class="stanza"><p class="line1">&#8220;You are just in these judgments, O Holy One,</p><p class="line2">you who are and who were;</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/16-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>for they have shed the blood of your holy people and your prophets,</p><p class="line2">and you have given them blood to drink as they deserve.&#8221;</p></div>
<p class="pcontinued"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/16-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>And I heard the altar respond:</p><div class="stanza"><p class="line1">&#8220;Yes, Lord God Almighty,</p><p class="line2">true and just are your judgments.&#8221;</p></div>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/16-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and the sun was allowed to scorch people with fire. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/16-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>They were seared by the intense heat and they cursed the name of God, who had control over these plagues, but they refused to repent and glorify him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/16-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>The fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and its kingdom was plunged into darkness. People gnawed their tongues in agony 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/16-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>and cursed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, but they refused to repent of what they had done.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/16-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the East. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/16-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then I saw three impure spirits that looked like frogs; they came out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/16-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>They are demonic spirits that perform signs, and they go out to the kings of the whole world, to gather them for the battle on the great day of God Almighty.</p>
