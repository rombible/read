<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>I looked, and there before me was a white horse! Its rider held a bow, and he was given a crown, and he rode out as a conqueror bent on conquest.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/6-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then another horse came out, a fiery red one. Its rider was given power to take peace from the earth and to make people kill each other. To him was given a large sword.</p>

 of wheat for a day&#8217;s wages,

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>I looked, and there before me was a pale horse! Its rider was named Death, and Hades was following close behind him. They were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill by sword, famine and plague, and by the wild beasts of the earth.</p>
