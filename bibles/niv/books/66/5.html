<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming in a loud voice, &#8220;Who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll?&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth could open the scroll or even look inside it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>I wept and wept because no one was found who was worthy to open the scroll or look inside. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then one of the elders said to me, &#8220;Do not weep! See, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has triumphed. He is able to open the scroll and its seven seals.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then I saw a Lamb, looking as if it had been slain, standing at the center of the throne, encircled by the four living creatures and the elders.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And when he had taken it, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb. Each one had a harp and they were holding golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of God&#8217;s people. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And they sang a new song, saying:</p><div class="stanza"><p class="line1">&#8220;You are worthy to take the scroll</p><p class="line2">and to open its seals,</p><p class="line1">because you were slain,</p><p class="line2">and with your blood you purchased for God</p><p class="line2">persons from every tribe and language and people and nation.</p>
