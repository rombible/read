<p class="sectionhead">John&#8217;s Vision of Christ</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>I, John, your brother and companion in the suffering and kingdom and patient endurance that are ours in Jesus, was on the island of Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>On the Lord&#8217;s Day I was in the Spirit, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>which said: <span class="red">&#8220;Write on a scroll what you see and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia and Laodicea.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>I turned around to see the voice that was speaking to me. And when I turned I saw seven golden lampstands, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>and among the lampstands was someone like a son of man,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="See Daniel 7:13.">d</a></sup></span>
 dressed in a robe reaching down to his feet and with a golden sash around his chest. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>The hair on his head was white like wool, as white as snow, and his eyes were like blazing fire. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>His feet were like bronze glowing in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of rushing waters. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>In his right hand he held seven stars, and coming out of his mouth was a sharp, double-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining in all its brilliance.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. Then he placed his right hand on me and said: <span class="red">&#8220;Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/1-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span><span class="red">I am the Living One; I was dead, and now look, I am alive for ever and ever! And I hold the keys of death and Hades.</span></p>
