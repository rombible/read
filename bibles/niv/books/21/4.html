<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And I declared that the dead,</p><p class="line2">who had already died,</p><p class="line1">are happier than the living,</p><p class="line2">who are still alive.</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But better than both</p><p class="line2">is the one who has never been born,</p><p class="line1">who has not seen the evil</p><p class="line2">that is done under the sun.</p></div>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And I saw that all toil and all achievement spring from one person&#8217;s envy of another. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.</p>
<div class="stanza"><p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Fools fold their hands</p><p class="line2">and ruin themselves.</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Better one handful with tranquillity</p><p class="line2">than two handfuls with toil</p><p class="line2">and chasing after the wind.</p></div>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Again I saw something meaningless under the sun:</p>
<div class="stanza"><p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>There was a man all alone;</p><p class="line2">he had neither son nor brother.</p><p class="line1">There was no end to his toil,</p><p class="line2">yet his eyes were not content with his wealth.</p><p class="line1">&#8220;For whom am I toiling,&#8221; he asked,</p><p class="line2">&#8220;and why am I depriving myself of enjoyment?&#8221;</p><p class="line1">This too is meaningless&#8212;</p><p class="line2">a miserable business!</p></div>
<div class="stanza"><p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Two are better than one,</p><p class="line2">because they have a good return for their labor:</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>If either of them falls down,</p><p class="line2">one can help the other up.</p><p class="line1">But pity anyone who falls</p><p class="line2">and has no one to help them up.</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Also, if two lie down together, they will keep warm.</p><p class="line2">But how can one keep warm alone?</p>

<p class="sectionhead">Advancement Is Meaningless</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Better a poor but wise youth than an old but foolish king who no longer knows how to heed a warning.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>I saw that all who lived and walked under the sun followed the youth, the king&#8217;s successor. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>There was no end to all the people who were before them.
