<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Since a king&#8217;s word is supreme, who can say to him, &#8220;What are you doing?&#8221;</p>

<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>For there is a proper time and procedure for every matter,</p><p class="line2">though a person may be weighed down by misery.</p></div>
<div class="stanza"><p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Since no one knows the future,</p><p class="line2">who can tell someone else what is to come?</p>

 no one has power over the time of their death.</p><p class="line1">As no one is discharged in time of war,</p><p class="line2">so wickedness will not release those who practice it.</p></div>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>All this I saw, as I applied my mind to everything done under the sun. There is a time when a man lords it over others to his own

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then too, I saw the wicked buried&#8212;those who used to come and go from the holy place and receive praise

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Yet because the wicked do not fear God, it will not go well with them, and their days will not lengthen like a shadow.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>There is something else meaningless that occurs on earth: the righteous who get what the wicked deserve, and the wicked who get what the righteous deserve. This too, I say, is meaningless. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So I commend the enjoyment of life, because there is nothing better for a person under the sun than to eat and drink and be glad.
