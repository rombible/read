<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Laughter,&#8221; I said, &#8220;is madness. And what does pleasure accomplish?&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>I tried cheering myself with wine, and embracing folly&#8212;my mind still guiding me with wisdom. I wanted to see what was good for people to do under the heavens during the few days of their lives.</p>

 as well&#8212;the delights of a man&#8217;s heart. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>I became greater by far than anyone in Jerusalem before me. In all this my wisdom stayed with me.</p>
