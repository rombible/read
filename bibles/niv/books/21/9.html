<div class="chap"><p class="sectionhead">A Common Destiny for All</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>So I reflected on all this and concluded that the righteous and the wise and what they do are in God&#8217;s hands, but no one knows whether love or hate awaits them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>All share a common destiny&#8212;the righteous and the wicked, the good and the bad,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Septuagint (Aquila), Vulgate and Syriac; Hebrew does not have and the bad.">a</a></sup></span>
 the clean and the unclean, those who offer sacrifices and those who do not.</p><div class="stanza"><p class="line1">As it is with the good,</p><p class="line2">so with the sinful;</p><p class="line1">as it is with those who take oaths,</p><p class="line2">so with those who are afraid to take them.</p></div>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>This is the evil in everything that happens under the sun: The same destiny overtakes all. The hearts of people, moreover, are full of evil and there is madness in their hearts while they live, and afterward they join the dead. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Anyone who is among the living has hope
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or What then is to be chosen? With all who live, there is hope">b</a></sup></span>
&#8212;even a live dog is better off than a dead lion!</p>
<div class="stanza"><p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For the living know that they will die,</p><p class="line2">but the dead know nothing;</p><p class="line1">they have no further reward,</p><p class="line2">and even their name is forgotten.</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Their love, their hate</p><p class="line2">and their jealousy have long since vanished;</p><p class="line1">never again will they have a part</p><p class="line2">in anything that happens under the sun.</p></div>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Go, eat your food with gladness, and drink your wine with a joyful heart, for God has already approved what you do. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Always be clothed in white, and always anoint your head with oil. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Enjoy life with your wife, whom you love, all the days of this meaningless life that God has given you under the sun&#8212;all your meaningless days. For this is your lot in life and in your toilsome labor under the sun. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might, for in the realm of the dead, where you are going, there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>I have seen something else under the sun:</p><div class="stanza"><p class="line1">The race is not to the swift</p><p class="line2">or the battle to the strong,</p><p class="line1">nor does food come to the wise</p><p class="line2">or wealth to the brilliant</p><p class="line2">or favor to the learned;</p><p class="line1">but time and chance happen to them all.</p></div>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Moreover, no one knows when their hour will come:</p><div class="stanza"><p class="line1">As fish are caught in a cruel net,</p><p class="line2">or birds are taken in a snare,</p><p class="line1">so people are trapped by evil times</p><p class="line2">that fall unexpectedly upon them.</p></div>
<p class="sectionhead">Wisdom Better Than Folly</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>I also saw under the sun this example of wisdom that greatly impressed me: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>There was once a small city with only a few people in it. And a powerful king came against it, surrounded it and built huge siege works against it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Now there lived in that city a man poor but wise, and he saved the city by his wisdom. But nobody remembered that poor man. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So I said, &#8220;Wisdom is better than strength.&#8221; But the poor man&#8217;s wisdom is despised, and his words are no longer heeded.</p>
<div class="stanza"><p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>The quiet words of the wise are more to be heeded</p><p class="line2">than the shouts of a ruler of fools.</p>
<p class="line1"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Wisdom is better than weapons of war,</p><p class="line2">but one sinner destroys much good.</p></div><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><A name="footnotes"></a><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotebot">Septuagint (Aquila), Vulgate and Syriac; Hebrew does not have <i>and the bad.</i></span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotebot">Or <i>What then is to be chosen?
