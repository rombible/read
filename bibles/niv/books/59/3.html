<div class="chap"><p class="sectionhead">Taming the Tongue</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/3-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Not many of you should become teachers, my fellow believers, because you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>We all stumble in many ways. Anyone who is never at fault in what they say is perfect, able to keep their whole body in check.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>When we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we can turn the whole animal. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Or take ships as an example. Although they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot wants to go. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Likewise, the tongue is a small part of the body, but it makes great boasts. Consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body. It corrupts the whole body, sets the whole course of one&#8217;s life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>All kinds of animals, birds, reptiles and sea creatures are being tamed and have been tamed by mankind, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>but no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>With the tongue we praise our Lord and Father, and with it we curse human beings, who have been made in God&#8217;s likeness. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Out of the same mouth come praise and cursing. My brothers and sisters, this should not be. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Can both fresh water and salt water flow from the same spring? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>My brothers and sisters, can a fig tree bear olives, or a grapevine bear figs? Neither can a salt spring produce fresh water.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Two Kinds of Wisdom</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Who is wise and understanding among you? Let them show it by their good life, by deeds done in the humility that comes from wisdom. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But if you harbor bitter envy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast about it or deny the truth. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Such &#8220;wisdom&#8221; does not come down from heaven but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/3-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>For where you have envy and selfish ambition, there you find disorder and every evil practice.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But the wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure; then peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/3-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Peacemakers who sow in peace reap a harvest of righteousness.</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
