<div class="chap"><p class="sectionhead">Favoritism Forbidden</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>My brothers and sisters, believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ must not show favoritism. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes, and a poor man in filthy old clothes also comes in. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>If you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say, &#8220;Here&#8217;s a good seat for you,&#8221; but say to the poor man, &#8220;You stand there&#8221; or &#8220;Sit on the floor by my feet,&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Listen, my dear brothers and sisters: Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom he promised those who love him? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But you have dishonored the poor. Is it not the rich who are exploiting you? Are they not the ones who are dragging you into court? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Are they not the ones who are blaspheming the noble name of him to whom you belong?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, &#8220;Love your neighbor as yourself,&#8221;
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Lev. 19:18">a</a></sup></span>
 you are doing right. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>For he who said, &#8220;You shall not commit adultery,&#8221;
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Exodus 20:14; Deut. 5:18">b</a></sup></span>
 also said, &#8220;You shall not murder.&#8221;
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Exodus 20:13; Deut. 5:17">c</a></sup></span>
 If you do not commit adultery but do commit murder, you have become a lawbreaker.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Speak and act as those who are going to be judged by the law that gives freedom, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>because judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful. Mercy triumphs over judgment.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Faith and Deeds</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save them? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Suppose a brother or a sister is without clothes and daily food. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>If one of you says to them, &#8220;Go in peace; keep warm and well fed,&#8221; but does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>But someone will say, &#8220;You have faith; I have deeds.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by my deeds. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that&#8212;and shudder.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>You foolish person, do you want evidence that faith without deeds is useless

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Was not our father Abraham considered righteous for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>You see that his faith and his actions were working together, and his faith was made complete by what he did. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And the scripture was fulfilled that says, &#8220;Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness,&#8221;
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Gen. 15:6">e</a></sup></span>
 and he was called God&#8217;s friend. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>You see that  a person is considered righteous by what they do and not by faith alone.</p>
