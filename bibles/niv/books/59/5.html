<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Your wealth has rotted, and moths have eaten your clothes. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Your gold and silver are corroded. Their corrosion will testify against you and eat your flesh like fire. You have hoarded wealth in the last days. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Look! The wages you failed to pay the workers who mowed your fields are crying out against you. The cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord Almighty. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>You have lived on earth in luxury and self-indulgence. You have fattened yourselves in the day of slaughter.
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or yourselves as in a day of feasting">a</a></sup></span>
 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>You have condemned and murdered the innocent one, who was not opposing you.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Patience in Suffering</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Be patient, then, brothers and sisters, until the Lord&#8217;s coming. See how the farmer waits for the land to yield its valuable crop, patiently waiting for the autumn and spring rains. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>You too, be patient and stand firm, because the Lord&#8217;s coming is near. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Don&#8217;t grumble against one another, brothers and sisters, or you will be judged. The Judge is standing at the door!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Brothers and sisters, as an example of patience in the face of suffering, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>As you know, we count as blessed those who have persevered. You have heard of Job&#8217;s perseverance and have seen what the Lord finally brought about. The Lord is full of compassion and mercy.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Above all, my brothers and sisters, do not swear&#8212;not by heaven or by earth or by anything else. All you need to say is a simple &#8220;Yes&#8221; or &#8220;No.&#8221; Otherwise you will be condemned.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">The Prayer of Faith</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/5-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Is anyone among you in trouble? Let them pray. Is anyone happy? Let them sing songs of praise. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/5-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/5-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise them up. If they have sinned, they will be forgiven. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/5-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/5-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Elijah was a human being, even as we are. He prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain on the land for three and a half years. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/5-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Again he prayed, and the heavens gave rain, and the earth produced its crops.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/5-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>My brothers and sisters, if one of you should wander from the truth and someone should bring that person back, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/james/5-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>remember this: Whoever turns a sinner from the error of their way will save them from death and cover over a multitude of sins.</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><A name="footnotes"></a><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotebot">Or <i>yourselves as in a day of feasting</i></span><br><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
