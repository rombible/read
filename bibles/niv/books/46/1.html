 in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree with one another in what you say and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfectly united in mind and thought.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>What I mean is this: One of you says, &#8220;I follow Paul&#8221;; another, &#8220;I follow Apollos&#8221;; another, &#8220;I follow Cephas

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>so no one can say that you were baptized in my name.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel&#8212;not with wisdom and eloquence, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Brothers and sisters, think of what you were when you were called. Not many of you were wise by human standards; not many were influential; not many were of noble birth. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>God chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things&#8212;and the things that are not&#8212;to nullify the things that are, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>so that no one may boast before him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God&#8212;that is, our righteousness, holiness and redemption.
