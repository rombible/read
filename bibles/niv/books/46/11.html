<p class="sectionhead">On Covering the Head in Worship</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>I praise you for remembering me in everything and for holding to the traditions just as I passed them on to you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But I want you to realize that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or of the wife is her husband">a</a></sup></span>
 and the head of Christ is God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head&#8212;it is the same as having her head shaved. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>For if a woman does not cover her head, she might as well have her hair cut off; but if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, then she should cover her head.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>A man ought not to cover his head,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or 4 Every man who prays or prophesies with long hair dishonors his head. 5 But every woman who prays or prophesies with no covering of hair dishonors her head--she is just like one of the ''shorn women.'' 6 If a woman has no covering, let her be for now with short hair; but since it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair shorn or shaved, she should grow it again. 7 A man ought not to have long hair">b</a></sup></span>
 since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For man did not come from woman, but woman from man; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>It is for this reason that a woman ought to have authority over her own
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or have a sign of authority on her">c</a></sup></span>
 head, because of the angels. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Nevertheless, in the Lord woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>For as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything comes from God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Does not the very nature of things teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>If anyone wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice&#8212;nor do the churches of God.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Correcting an Abuse of the Lord&#8217;s Supper</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your meetings do more harm than good. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, there are divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God&#8217;s approval. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So then, when you come together, it is not the Lord&#8217;s Supper you eat, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>for when you are eating, some of you go ahead with your own private suppers. As a result, one person remains hungry and another gets drunk. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Don&#8217;t you have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God by humiliating those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? Certainly not in this matter!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, <span class="red">&#8220;This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.&#8221;</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, <span class="red">&#8220;This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.&#8221;</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord&#8217;s death until he comes.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>So then, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Everyone ought to examine themselves before they eat of the bread and drink from the cup. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>For those who eat and drink without discerning the body of Christ eat and drink judgment on themselves. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>But if we were more discerning with regard to ourselves, we would not come under such judgment. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Nevertheless, when we are judged in this way by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be finally condemned with the world.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>So then, my brothers and sisters, when you gather to eat, you should all eat together. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Anyone who is hungry should eat something at home, so that when you meet together it may not result in judgment.</p><p class="reg">And when I come I will give further directions.</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><A name="footnotes"></a><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotebot">Or <i>of the wife is her husband</i></span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotebot">Or <i><span class="fnref">4</span>Every man who prays or prophesies with long hair dishonors his head. <span class="fnref">5</span>But every woman who prays or prophesies with no covering of hair dishonors her head&#8212;she is just like one of the &#8220;shorn women.&#8221; <span class="fnref">6</span>If a woman has no covering, let her be for now with short hair; but since it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair shorn or shaved, she should grow it again. <span class="fnref">7</span>A man ought not to have long hair</i></span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">c</span> <span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotebot">Or <i>have a sign of authority on her</i></span><br><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
