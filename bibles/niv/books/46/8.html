<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Those who think they know something do not yet know as they ought to know.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So then, about eating food sacrificed to idols: We know that &#8220;An idol is nothing at all in the world&#8221; and that &#8220;There is no God but one.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as indeed there are many &#8220;gods&#8221; and many &#8220;lords&#8221;), 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom all things came and for whom we live; and there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things came and through whom we live.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But not everyone possesses this knowledge. Some people are still so accustomed to idols that when they eat sacrificial food they think of it as having been sacrificed to a god, and since their conscience is weak, it is defiled. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But food does not bring us near to God; we are no worse if we do not eat, and no better if we do.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Be careful, however, that the exercise of your rights does not become a stumbling block to the weak. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For if someone with a weak conscience sees you, with all your knowledge, eating in an idol&#8217;s temple, won&#8217;t that person be emboldened to eat what is sacrificed to idols? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So this weak brother or sister, for whom Christ died, is destroyed by your knowledge. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>When you sin against them in this way and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Therefore, if what I eat causes my brother or sister to fall into sin, I will never eat meat again, so that I will not cause them to fall.</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><A name="footnotes"></a><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotebot">An early manuscript and another ancient witness <i>think they have knowledge do not yet know as they ought to know. <span class="fnref">3</span>But whoever loves truly knows.</i></span><br><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
