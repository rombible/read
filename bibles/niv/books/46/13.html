 of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal.

 but do not have love, I gain nothing.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And now these three remain: faith, hope and love.
