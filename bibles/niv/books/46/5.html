<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And you are proud! Shouldn&#8217;t you rather have gone into mourning and have put out of your fellowship the man who has been doing this? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For my part, even though I am not physically present, I am with you in spirit. As one who is present with you in this way, I have already passed judgment in the name of our Lord Jesus on the one who has been doing this. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So when you are assembled and I am with you in spirit, and the power of our Lord Jesus is present, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh,

<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or of his body">b</a></sup></span>
 so that his spirit may be saved on the day of the Lord.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Your boasting is not good. Don&#8217;t you know that a little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Get rid of the old yeast, so that you may be a new unleavened batch&#8212;as you really are. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Therefore let us keep the Festival, not with the old bread leavened with malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people&#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>not at all meaning the people of this world who are immoral, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters. In that case you would have to leave this world. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But now I am writing to you that you must not associate with anyone who claims to be a brother or sister
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="The Greek word for brother or sister (adelphos) refers here to a believer, whether man or woman, as part of God's family; also in 8:11, 13.">c</a></sup></span>
 but is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or slanderer, a drunkard or swindler. Do not even eat with such people.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>What business is it of mine to judge those outside the church? Are you not to judge those inside? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>God will judge those outside. &#8220;Expel the wicked person from among you.&#8221;
