<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>For anyone who speaks in a tongue

 does not speak to people but to God. Indeed, no one understands them; they utter mysteries by the Spirit. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But the one who prophesies speaks to people for their strengthening, encouraging and comfort. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Anyone who speaks in a tongue edifies themselves, but the one who prophesies edifies the church. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>I would like every one of you to speak in tongues,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or in other languages; also in verses 6, 18, 22, 23 and 39">b</a></sup></span>
 but I would rather have you prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or in other languages; also in verses 6, 18, 22, 23 and 39">c</a></sup></span>
 unless someone interprets, so that the church may be edified.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now, brothers and sisters, if I come to you and speak in tongues, what good will I be to you, unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or word of instruction? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Even in the case of lifeless things that make sounds, such as the pipe or harp, how will anyone know what tune is being played unless there is a distinction in the notes? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Again, if the trumpet does not sound a clear call, who will get ready for battle? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So it is with you. Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue, how will anyone know what you are saying? You will just be speaking into the air. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Undoubtedly there are all sorts of languages in the world, yet none of them is without meaning. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>If then I do not grasp the meaning of what someone is saying, I am a foreigner to the speaker, and the speaker is a foreigner to me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So it is with you. Since you are eager for gifts of the Spirit, try to excel in those that build up the church.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For this reason the one who speaks in a tongue should pray that they may interpret what they say. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So what shall I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my understanding; I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my understanding. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Otherwise when you are praising God in the Spirit, how can someone else, who is now put in the position of an inquirer,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="The Greek word for inquirer is a technical term for someone not fully initiated into a religion; also in verses 23 and 24.">d</a></sup></span>
 say &#8220;Amen&#8221; to your thanksgiving, since they do not know what you are saying? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>You are giving thanks well enough, but no one else is edified.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>But in the church I would rather speak five intelligible words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Brothers and sisters, stop thinking like children. In regard to evil be infants, but in your thinking be adults. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>In the Law it is written:</p><div class="stanza"><p class="line1">&#8220;With other tongues</p><p class="line2">and through the lips of foreigners</p><p class="line1">I will speak to this people,</p><p class="line2">but even then they will not listen to me,</p><p class="attribution">says the Lord.&#8221;

</p></div>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Tongues, then, are a sign, not for believers but for unbelievers; prophecy, however, is not for unbelievers but for believers. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>So if the whole church comes together and everyone speaks in tongues, and inquirers or unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your mind? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>But if an unbeliever or an inquirer comes in while everyone is prophesying, they are convicted of sin and are brought under judgment by all, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>as the secrets of their hearts are laid bare. So they will fall down and worship God, exclaiming, &#8220;God is really among you!&#8221;</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Good Order in Worship</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>What then shall we say, brothers and sisters? When you come together, each of you has a hymn, or a word of instruction, a revelation, a tongue or an interpretation. Everything must be done so that the church may be built up. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>If anyone speaks in a tongue, two&#8212;or at the most three&#8212;should speak, one at a time, and someone must interpret. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>If there is no interpreter, the speaker should keep quiet in the church and speak to himself and to God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And if a revelation comes to someone who is sitting down, the first speaker should stop. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>For you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>The spirits of prophets are subject to the control of prophets. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>For God is not a God of disorder but of peace&#8212;as in all the congregations of the Lord&#8217;s people.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Women
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or peace. As in all the congregations of the Lord's people, 34 women">f</a></sup></span>
 should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the law says. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church.

</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Or did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only people it has reached? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>If anyone thinks they are a prophet or otherwise gifted by the Spirit, let them acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lord&#8217;s command.
