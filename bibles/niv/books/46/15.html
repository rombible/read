<div class="chap"><p class="sectionhead">The Resurrection of Christ</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Now, brothers and sisters, I want to remind you of the gospel I preached to you, which you received and on which you have taken your stand. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or you at the first">a</a></sup></span>
: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>and that he appeared to Cephas,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, Peter">b</a></sup></span>
 and then to the Twelve. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>and last of all he appeared to me also, as to one abnormally born.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For I am the least of the apostles and do not even deserve to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace to me was not without effect. No, I worked harder than all of them&#8212;yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Whether, then, it is I or they, this is what we preach, and this is what you believed.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">The Resurrection of the Dead</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But if it is preached that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>More than that, we are then found to be false witnesses about God, for we have testified about God that he raised Christ from the dead. But he did not raise him if in fact the dead are not raised. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised either. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are of all people most to be pitied.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>But each in turn: Christ, the firstfruits; then, when he comes, those who belong to him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then the end will come, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he has destroyed all dominion, authority and power. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>The last enemy to be destroyed is death. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>For he &#8220;has put everything under his feet.&#8221;
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Psalm 8:6">c</a></sup></span>
 Now when it says that &#8220;everything&#8221; has been put under him, it is clear that this does not include God himself, who put everything under Christ. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>When he has done this, then the Son himself will be made subject to him who put everything under him, so that God may be all in all.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Now if there is no resurrection, what will those do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized for them? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>And as for us, why do we endanger ourselves every hour? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>I face death every day&#8212;yes, just as surely as I boast about you in Christ Jesus our Lord. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>If I fought wild beasts in Ephesus with no more than human hopes, what have I gained? If the dead are not raised,</p><div class="stanza"><p class="line1">&#8220;Let us eat and drink,</p><p class="line2">for tomorrow we die.&#8221;

<p class="pcontinued"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Do not be misled: &#8220;Bad company corrupts good character.&#8221;

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Come back to your senses as you ought, and stop sinning; for there are some who are ignorant of God&#8212;I say this to your shame.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">The Resurrection Body</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>But someone will ask, &#8220;How are the dead raised? With what kind of body will they come?&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>How foolish! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>When you sow, you do not plant the body that will be, but just a seed, perhaps of wheat or of something else. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>But God gives it a body as he has determined, and to each kind of seed he gives its own body. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>Not all flesh is the same: People have one kind of flesh, animals have another, birds another and fish another. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>There are also heavenly bodies and there are earthly bodies; but the splendor of the heavenly bodies is one kind, and the splendor of the earthly bodies is another. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>The sun has one kind of splendor, the moon another and the stars another; and star differs from star in splendor.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>So will it be with the resurrection of the dead. The body that is sown is perishable, it is raised imperishable; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;
