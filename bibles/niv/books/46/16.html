<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>On the first day of every week, each one of you should set aside a sum of money in keeping with your income, saving it up, so that when I come no collections will have to be made. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then, when I arrive, I will give letters of introduction to the men you approve and send them with your gift to Jerusalem. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>If it seems advisable for me to go also, they will accompany me.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Personal Requests</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>After I go through Macedonia, I will come to you&#8212;for I will be going through Macedonia. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Perhaps I will stay with you for a while, or even spend the winter, so that you can help me on my journey, wherever I go. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For I do not want to see you now and make only a passing visit; I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord permits. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But I will stay on at Ephesus until Pentecost, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>because a great door for effective work has opened to me, and there are many who oppose me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>When Timothy comes, see to it that he has nothing to fear while he is with you, for he is carrying on the work of the Lord, just as I am. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>No one, then, should treat him with contempt. Send him on his way in peace so that he may return to me. I am expecting him along with the brothers.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now about our brother Apollos: I strongly urged him to go to you with the brothers. He was quite unwilling to go now, but he will go when he has the opportunity.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Be on your guard; stand firm in the faith; be courageous; be strong. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Do everything in love.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>You know that the household of Stephanas were the first converts in Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to the service of the Lord&#8217;s people. I urge you, brothers and sisters, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>to submit to such people and to everyone who joins in the work and labors at it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>I was glad when Stephanas, Fortunatus and Achaicus arrived, because they have supplied what was lacking from you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>For they refreshed my spirit and yours also. Such men deserve recognition.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Final Greetings</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>The churches in the province of Asia send you greetings. Aquila and Priscilla
