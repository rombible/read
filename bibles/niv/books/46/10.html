<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>They were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>They all ate the same spiritual food 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them, and that rock was Christ. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Nevertheless, God was not pleased with most of them; their bodies were scattered in the wilderness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now these things occurred as examples to keep us from setting our hearts on evil things as they did. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Do not be idolaters, as some of them were; as it is written: &#8220;The people sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in revelry.&#8221;
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Exodus 32:6">a</a></sup></span>
 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>We should not commit sexual immorality, as some of them did&#8212;and in one day twenty-three thousand of them died. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>We should not test Christ,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts test the Lord">b</a></sup></span>
 as some of them did&#8212;and were killed by snakes. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And do not grumble, as some of them did&#8212;and were killed by the destroying angel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>These things happened to them as examples and were written down as warnings for us, on whom the culmination of the ages has come. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So, if you think you are standing firm, be careful that you don&#8217;t fall! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>No temptation
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="The Greek for temptation and tempted can also mean testing and tested.">c</a></sup></span>
 has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="The Greek for temptation and tempted can also mean testing and tested.">d</a></sup></span>
 beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="The Greek for temptation and tempted can also mean testing and tested.">e</a></sup></span>
 he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Idol Feasts and the Lord&#8217;s Supper</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Therefore, my dear friends, flee from idolatry. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>I speak to sensible people; judge for yourselves what I say. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Is not the cup of thanksgiving for which we give thanks a participation in the blood of Christ? And is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Because there is one loaf, we, who are many, are one body, for we all share the one loaf.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Consider the people of Israel: Do not those who eat the sacrifices participate in the altar? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Do I mean then that food sacrificed to an idol is anything, or that an idol is anything? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>No, but the sacrifices of pagans are offered to demons, not to God, and I do not want you to be participants with demons. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons too; you cannot have a part in both the Lord&#8217;s table and the table of demons. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Are we trying to arouse the Lord&#8217;s jealousy? Are we stronger than he?</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>No one should seek their own good, but the good of others.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Eat anything sold in the meat market without raising questions of conscience, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>for, &#8220;The earth is the Lord&#8217;s, and everything in it.&#8221;

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>If an unbeliever invites you to a meal and you want to go, eat whatever is put before you without raising questions of conscience. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>But if someone says to you, &#8220;This has been offered in sacrifice,&#8221; then do not eat it, both for the sake of the one who told you and for the sake of conscience. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>I am referring to the other person&#8217;s conscience, not yours. For why is my freedom being judged by another&#8217;s conscience?
