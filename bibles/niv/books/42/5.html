<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, the Sea of Galilee">a</a></sup></span>
 the people were crowding around him and listening to the word of God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>He saw at the water&#8217;s edge two boats, left there by the fishermen, who were washing their nets. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>He got into one of the boats, the one belonging to Simon, and asked him to put out a little from shore. Then he sat down and taught the people from the boat.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, <span class="red">&#8220;Put out into deep water, and let down the nets for a catch.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Simon answered, &#8220;Master, we&#8217;ve worked hard all night and haven&#8217;t caught anything. But because you say so, I will let down the nets.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So they signaled their partners in the other boat to come and help them, and they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus&#8217; knees and said, &#8220;Go away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man!&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>For he and all his companions were astonished at the catch of fish they had taken, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>and so were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, Simon&#8217;s partners.</p><p class="reg">Then Jesus said to Simon, <span class="red">&#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid; from now on you will fish for people.&#8221;</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So they pulled their boats up on shore, left everything and followed him.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Jesus Heals a Man With Leprosy</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>While Jesus was in one of the towns, a man came along who was covered with leprosy.
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="The Greek word traditionally translated leprosy was used for various diseases affecting the skin.">b</a></sup></span>
 When he saw Jesus, he fell with his face to the ground and begged him, &#8220;Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. <span class="red">&#8220;I am willing,&#8221;</span> he said. <span class="red">&#8220;Be clean!&#8221;</span> And immediately the leprosy left him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then Jesus ordered him, <span class="red">&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Yet the news about him spread all the more, so that crowds of people came to hear him and to be healed of their sicknesses. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Jesus Forgives and Heals a Paralyzed Man</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>One day Jesus was teaching, and Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there. They had come from every village of Galilee and from Judea and Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was with Jesus to heal the sick. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Some men came carrying a paralyzed man on a mat and tried to take him into the house to lay him before Jesus. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>When they could not find a way to do this because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and lowered him on his mat through the tiles into the middle of the crowd, right in front of Jesus.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>When Jesus saw their faith, he said, <span class="red">&#8220;Friend, your sins are forgiven.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>The Pharisees and the teachers of the law began thinking to themselves, &#8220;Who is this fellow who speaks blasphemy? Who can forgive sins but God alone?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Jesus knew what they were thinking and asked, <span class="red">&#8220;Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span><span class="red">Which is easier: to say, &#8216;Your sins are forgiven,&#8217; or to say, &#8216;Get up and walk&#8217;?</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span><span class="red">But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.&#8221;</span> So he said to the paralyzed man, <span class="red">&#8220;I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home.&#8221;</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Immediately he stood up in front of them, took what he had been lying on and went home praising God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Everyone was amazed and gave praise to God. They were filled with awe and said, &#8220;We have seen remarkable things today.&#8221;</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Then Levi held a great banquet for Jesus at his house, and a large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law who belonged to their sect complained to his disciples, &#8220;Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/5-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Jesus answered them, <span class="red">&#8220;It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.</span>
