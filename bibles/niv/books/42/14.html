<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>There in front of him was a man suffering from abnormal swelling of his body. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Jesus asked the Pharisees and experts in the law, <span class="red">&#8220;Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not?&#8221;</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But they remained silent. So taking hold of the man, he healed him and sent him on his way.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then he asked them, <span class="red">&#8220;If one of you has a child
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts donkey">a</a></sup></span>
 or an ox that falls into a well on the Sabbath day, will you not immediately pull it out?&#8221;</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And they had nothing to say.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>When he noticed how the guests picked the places of honor at the table, he told them this parable: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;When someone invites you to a wedding feast, do not take the place of honor, for a person more distinguished than you may have been invited.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span><span class="red">If so, the host who invited both of you will come and say to you, &#8216;Give this person your seat.&#8217; Then, humiliated, you will have to take the least important place.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><span class="red">But when you are invited, take the lowest place, so that when your host comes, he will say to you, &#8216;Friend, move up to a better place.&#8217; Then you will be honored in the presence of all the other guests.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span><span class="red">For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then Jesus said to his host, <span class="red">&#8220;When you give a luncheon or dinner, do not invite your friends, your brothers or sisters, your relatives, or your rich neighbors; if you do, they may invite you back and so you will be repaid.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span><span class="red">But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind,</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span><span class="red">and you will be blessed. Although they cannot repay you, you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="sectionhead">The Parable of the Great Banquet</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>When one of those at the table with him heard this, he said to Jesus, &#8220;Blessed is the one who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Jesus replied: <span class="red">&#8220;A certain man was preparing a great banquet and invited many guests.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span><span class="red">At the time of the banquet he sent his servant to tell those who had been invited, &#8216;Come, for everything is now ready.&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said, &#8216;I have just bought a field, and I must go and see it. Please excuse me.&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;Another said, &#8216;I have just bought five yoke of oxen, and I&#8217;m on my way to try them out. Please excuse me.&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;Still another said, &#8216;I just got married, so I can&#8217;t come.&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;The servant came back and reported this to his master.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;Sir,&#8217; the servant said, &#8216;what you ordered has been done, but there is still room.&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;Then the master told his servant, &#8216;Go out to the roads and country lanes and compel them to come in, so that my house will be full.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span><span class="red">I tell you, not one of those who were invited will get a taste of my banquet.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</span></p>
