 Quirinius was governor of Syria.) 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And everyone went to their own town to register.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no guest room available for them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>But the angel said to them, &#8220;Do not be afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah, the Lord. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying,</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, &#8220;Let&#8217;s go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child,

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>On the eighth day, when it was time to circumcise the child, he was named Jesus, the name the angel had given him before he was conceived.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon, who was righteous and devout. He was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was on him.
