<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Tell us by what authority you are doing these things,&#8221; they said. &#8220;Who gave you this authority?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>He replied, <span class="red">&#8220;I will also ask you a question. Tell me:</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span><span class="red">John&#8217;s baptism&#8212;was it from heaven, or of human origin?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>They discussed it among themselves and said, &#8220;If we say, &#8216;From heaven,&#8217; he will ask, &#8216;Why didn&#8217;t you believe him?&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But if we say, &#8216;Of human origin,&#8217; all the people will stone us, because they are persuaded that John was a prophet.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So they answered, &#8220;We don&#8217;t know where it was from.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Jesus said, <span class="red">&#8220;Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="sectionhead">The Parable of the Tenants</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>He went on to tell the people this parable: <span class="red">&#8220;A man planted a vineyard, rented it to some farmers and went away for a long time.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><span class="red">At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants so they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span><span class="red">He sent another servant, but that one also they beat and treated shamefully and sent away empty-handed.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span><span class="red">He sent still a third, and they wounded him and threw him out.</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;Then the owner of the vineyard said, &#8216;What shall I do? I will send my son, whom I love; perhaps they will respect him.&#8217;</span></p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span><span class="red">So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.</span></p><p class="reg"><span class="red">&#8220;What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?</span>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Jesus looked directly at them and asked, <span class="red">&#8220;Then what is the meaning of that which is written:</span></p><div class="stanza"><p class="line1"><span class="red">&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;The stone the builders rejected</span></p><p class="line2"><span class="red">has become the cornerstone&#8217;

<p class="sectionhead">Paying Taxes to Caesar</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Keeping a close watch on him, they sent spies, who pretended to be sincere.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>So the spies questioned him: &#8220;Teacher, we know that you speak and teach what is right, and that you do not show partiality but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?&#8221;</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Now there were seven brothers. The first one married a woman and died childless.
