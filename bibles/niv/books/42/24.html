<div class="chap"><p class="sectionhead">Jesus Has Risen</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>They found the stone rolled away from the tomb, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>While they were wondering about this, suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>In their fright the women bowed down with their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, &#8220;Why do you look for the living among the dead? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>He is not here; he has risen! Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in Galilee: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8216;The Son of Man must be delivered over to the hands of sinners, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.&#8217;</span>&#8239;&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then they remembered his words.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>When they came back from the tomb, they told all these things to the Eleven and to all the others. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the others with them who told this to the apostles. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But they did not believe the women, because their words seemed to them like nonsense. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. Bending over, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he went away, wondering to himself what had happened.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">On the Road to Emmaus</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Now that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or about 11 kilometers">a</a></sup></span>
 from Jerusalem. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>They were talking with each other about everything that had happened. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came up and walked along with them; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>but they were kept from recognizing him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>He asked them, <span class="red">&#8220;What are you discussing together as you walk along?&#8221;</span></p><p class="reg">They stood still, their faces downcast. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>One of them, named Cleopas, asked him, &#8220;Are you the only one visiting Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;What things?&#8221;</span> he asked.</p><p class="reg">&#8220;About Jesus of Nazareth,&#8221; they replied. &#8220;He was a prophet, powerful in word and deed before God and all the people. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>The chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified him; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>but we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. And what is more, it is the third day since all this took place. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>In addition, some of our women amazed us. They went to the tomb early this morning 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>but didn&#8217;t find his body. They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels, who said he was alive. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but they did not see Jesus.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>He said to them, <span class="red">&#8220;How foolish you are, and how slow to believe all that the prophets have spoken!</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span><span class="red">Did not the Messiah have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?&#8221;</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus continued on as if he were going farther. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>But they urged him strongly, &#8220;Stay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day is almost over.&#8221; So he went in to stay with them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>They asked each other, &#8220;Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and those with them, assembled together 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>and saying, &#8220;It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Then the two told what had happened on the way, and how Jesus was recognized by them when he broke the bread.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Jesus Appears to the Disciples</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>While they were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, <span class="red">&#8220;Peace be with you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>He said to them, <span class="red">&#8220;Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds?</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span><span class="red">Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>When he had said this, he showed them his hands and feet. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>And while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement, he asked them, <span class="red">&#8220;Do you have anything here to eat?&#8221;</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>They gave him a piece of broiled fish, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>and he took it and ate it in their presence.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>He said to them, <span class="red">&#8220;This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span>He told them, <span class="red">&#8220;This is what is written: The Messiah will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day,</span>
