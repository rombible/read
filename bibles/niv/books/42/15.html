<div class="chap"><p class="sectionhead">The Parable of the Lost Sheep</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Now the tax collectors and sinners were all gathering around to hear Jesus. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered, &#8220;This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then Jesus told them this parable: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Doesn&#8217;t he leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it?</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span><span class="red">And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span><span class="red">and goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says, &#8216;Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep.&#8217;</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span><span class="red">I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent.</span></p>
<p class="sectionhead">The Parable of the Lost Coin</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;Or suppose a woman has ten silver coins
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Greek ten drachmas, each worth about a day's wages">a</a></sup></span>
 and loses one. Doesn&#8217;t she light a lamp, sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it?</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span><span class="red">And when she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors together and says, &#8216;Rejoice with me; I have found my lost coin.&#8217;</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><span class="red">In the same way, I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="sectionhead">The Parable of the Lost Son</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Jesus continued: <span class="red">&#8220;There was a man who had two sons.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span><span class="red">The younger one said to his father, &#8216;Father, give me my share of the estate.&#8217; So he divided his property between them.</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;Not long after that, the younger son got together all he had, set off for a distant country and there squandered his wealth in wild living.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span><span class="red">After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine in that whole country, and he began to be in need.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span><span class="red">So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span><span class="red">He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything.</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;When he came to his senses, he said, &#8216;How many of my father&#8217;s hired servants have food to spare, and here I am starving to death!</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span><span class="red">I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span><span class="red">I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants.&#8217;</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span><span class="red">So he got up and went to his father.</span></p><p class="reg"><span class="red">&#8220;But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him.</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;The son said to him, &#8216;Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;But the father said to his servants, &#8216;Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span><span class="red">Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let&#8217;s have a feast and celebrate.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span><span class="red">For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.&#8217; So they began to celebrate.</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;Meanwhile, the older son was in the field. When he came near the house, he heard music and dancing.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span><span class="red">So he called one of the servants and asked him what was going on.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8216;Your brother has come,&#8217; he replied, &#8216;and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;The older brother became angry and refused to go in. So his father went out and pleaded with him.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span><span class="red">But he answered his father, &#8216;Look! All these years I&#8217;ve been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span><span class="red">But when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him!&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;My son,&#8217; the father said, &#8216;you are always with me, and everything I have is yours.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/15-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span><span class="red">But we had to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</span></p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><A name="footnotes"></a><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotebot">Greek <i>ten drachmas,</i> each worth about a day&#8217;s wages</span><br><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
