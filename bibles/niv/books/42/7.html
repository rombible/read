<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>There a centurion&#8217;s servant, whom his master valued highly, was sick and about to die. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>The centurion heard of Jesus and sent some elders of the Jews to him, asking him to come and heal his servant. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>When they came to Jesus, they pleaded earnestly with him, &#8220;This man deserves to have you do this, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>because he loves our nation and has built our synagogue.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So Jesus went with them.</p><p class="reg">He was not far from the house when the centurion sent friends to say to him: &#8220;Lord, don&#8217;t trouble yourself, for I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>That is why I did not even consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the word, and my servant will be healed. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, &#8216;Go,&#8217; and he goes; and that one, &#8216;Come,&#8217; and he comes. I say to my servant, &#8216;Do this,&#8217; and he does it.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him, and turning to the crowd following him, he said, <span class="red">&#8220;I tell you, I have not found such great faith even in Israel.&#8221;</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then the men who had been sent returned to the house and found the servant well.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Then he went up and touched the bier they were carrying him on, and the bearers stood still. He said, <span class="red">&#8220;Young man, I say to you, get up!&#8221;</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to his mother.</p>
