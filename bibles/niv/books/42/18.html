<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>He said: <span class="red">&#8220;In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor cared what people thought.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span><span class="red">And there was a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea, &#8216;Grant me justice against my adversary.&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;For some time he refused. But finally he said to himself, &#8216;Even though I don&#8217;t fear God or care what people think,</span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span><span class="red">And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off?</span>

<p class="sectionhead">The Parable of the Pharisee and the Tax Collector</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everyone else, Jesus told this parable: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span><span class="red">The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed: &#8216;God, I thank you that I am not like other people&#8212;robbers, evildoers, adulterers&#8212;or even like this tax collector.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span><span class="red">I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, &#8216;God, have mercy on me, a sinner.&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But Jesus called the children to him and said, <span class="red">&#8220;Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span><span class="red">Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.&#8221;</span></p>
