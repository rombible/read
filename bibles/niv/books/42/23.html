<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So Pilate asked Jesus, &#8220;Are you the king of the Jews?&#8221;</p><p class="reg"><span class="red">&#8220;You have said so,&#8221;</span> Jesus replied.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But they insisted, &#8220;He stirs up the people all over Judea by his teaching. He started in Galilee and has come all the way here.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>On hearing this, Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean.
