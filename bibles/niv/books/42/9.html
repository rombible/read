<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>He told them: <span class="red">&#8220;Take nothing for the journey&#8212;no staff, no bag, no bread, no money, no extra shirt.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span><span class="red">Whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave that town.</span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So they set out and went from village to village, proclaiming the good news and healing people everywhere.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was going on. And he was perplexed because some were saying that John had been raised from the dead, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>others that Elijah had appeared, and still others that one of the prophets of long ago had come back to life. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But Herod said, &#8220;I beheaded John. Who, then, is this I hear such things about?&#8221; And he tried to see him.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Jesus Feeds the Five Thousand</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>When the apostles returned, they reported to Jesus what they had done. Then he took them with him and they withdrew by themselves to a town called Bethsaida, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>but the crowds learned about it and followed him. He welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who needed healing.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Late in the afternoon the Twelve came to him and said, &#8220;Send the crowd away so they can go to the surrounding villages and countryside and find food and lodging, because we are in a remote place here.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>He replied, <span class="red">&#8220;You give them something to eat.&#8221;</span></p><p class="reg">They answered, &#8220;We have only five loaves of bread and two fish&#8212;unless we go and buy food for all this crowd.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>(About five thousand men were there.)</p><p class="reg">But he said to his disciples, <span class="red">&#8220;Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each.&#8221;</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>The disciples did so, and everyone sat down. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke them. Then he gave them to the disciples to distribute to the people. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Peter Declares That Jesus Is the Messiah</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Once when Jesus was praying in private and his disciples were with him, he asked them, <span class="red">&#8220;Who do the crowds say I am?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>They replied, &#8220;Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, that one of the prophets of long ago has come back to life.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;But what about you?&#8221;</span> he asked. <span class="red">&#8220;Who do you say I am?&#8221;</span></p><p class="reg">Peter answered, &#8220;God&#8217;s Messiah.&#8221;</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Jesus Predicts His Death</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Jesus strictly warned them not to tell this to anyone. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And he said, <span class="red">&#8220;The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Then he said to them all: <span class="red">&#8220;Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span><span class="red">For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will save it.</span>

<p class="sectionhead">The Transfiguration</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>About eight days after Jesus said this, he took Peter, John and James with him and went up onto a mountain to pray. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>As he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became as bright as a flash of lightning. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Two men, Moses and Elijah, appeared in glorious splendor, talking with Jesus. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>They spoke about his departure,

 which he was about to bring to fulfillment at Jerusalem. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>Peter and his companions were very sleepy, but when they became fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men standing with him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>As the men were leaving Jesus, Peter said to him, &#8220;Master, it is good for us to be here.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>While he was speaking, a cloud appeared and covered them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>A voice came from the cloud, saying, &#8220;This is my Son, whom I have chosen; listen to him.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>When the voice had spoken, they found that Jesus was alone. The disciples kept this to themselves and did not tell anyone at that time what they had seen.</p>
