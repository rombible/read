<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Some of the Pharisees asked, &#8220;Why are you doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Jesus answered them, <span class="red">&#8220;Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/6-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span><span class="red">He entered the house of God, and taking the consecrated bread, he ate what is lawful only for priests to eat. And he also gave some to his companions.&#8221;</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/6-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then Jesus said to them, <span class="red">&#8220;The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>On another Sabbath he went into the synagogue and was teaching, and a man was there whose right hand was shriveled. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>The Pharisees and the teachers of the law were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to the man with the shriveled hand, <span class="red">&#8220;Get up and stand in front of everyone.&#8221;</span> So he got up and stood there.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then Jesus said to them, <span class="red">&#8220;I ask you, which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/6-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>He looked around at them all, and then said to the man, <span class="red">&#8220;Stretch out your hand.&#8221;</span> He did so, and his hand was completely restored. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/6-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law were furious and began to discuss with one another what they might do to Jesus.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">The Twelve Apostles</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/6-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>One of those days Jesus went out to a mountainside to pray, and spent the night praying to God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/6-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>When morning came, he called his disciples to him and chose twelve of them, whom he also designated apostles: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/6-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Simon (whom he named Peter), his brother Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/6-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon who was called the Zealot, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/6-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Blessings and Woes</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/6-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>He went down with them and stood on a level place. A large crowd of his disciples was there and a great number of people from all over Judea, from Jerusalem, and from the coastal region around Tyre and Sidon, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/6-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>who had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases. Those troubled by impure spirits were cured, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/6-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>and the people all tried to touch him, because power was coming from him and healing them all.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/6-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Looking at his disciples, he said:</p><div class="stanza"><p class="line1"><span class="red">&#8220;Blessed are you who are poor,</span></p><p class="line2"><span class="red">for yours is the kingdom of God.</span></p>
