<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span><span class="red">So he called him in and asked him, &#8216;What is this I hear about you? Give an account of your management, because you cannot be manager any longer.&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;The manager said to himself, &#8216;What shall I do now? My master is taking away my job. I&#8217;m not strong enough to dig, and I&#8217;m ashamed to beg&#8212;</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span><span class="red">I know what I&#8217;ll do so that, when I lose my job here, people will welcome me into their houses.&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;So he called in each one of his master&#8217;s debtors. He asked the first, &#8216;How much do you owe my master?&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;Nine hundred gallons
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or about 3,000 liters">a</a></sup></span>
 of olive oil,&#8217; he replied.</span></p><p class="reg"><span class="red">&#8220;The manager told him, &#8216;Take your bill, sit down quickly, and make it four hundred and fifty.&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;Then he asked the second, &#8216;And how much do you owe?&#8217;</span></p><p class="reg"><span class="red">&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;A thousand bushels
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or about 30 tons">b</a></sup></span>
 of wheat,&#8217; he replied.</span></p><p class="reg"><span class="red">&#8220;He told him, &#8216;Take your bill and make it eight hundred.&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;The master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly. For the people of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own kind than are the people of the light.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span><span class="red">I tell you, use worldly wealth to gain friends for yourselves, so that when it is gone, you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings.</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span><span class="red">So if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth, who will trust you with true riches?</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span><span class="red">And if you have not been trustworthy with someone else&#8217;s property, who will give you property of your own?</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>The Pharisees, who loved money, heard all this and were sneering at Jesus. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>He said to them, <span class="red">&#8220;You are the ones who justify yourselves in the eyes of others, but God knows your hearts. What people value highly is detestable in God&#8217;s sight.</span></p>
<p class="sectionhead">Additional Teachings</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;The Law and the Prophets were proclaimed until John. Since that time, the good news of the kingdom of God is being preached, and everyone is forcing their way into it.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span><span class="red">It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery, and the man who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.</span></p>
<p class="sectionhead">The Rich Man and Lazarus</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in luxury every day.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span><span class="red">At his gate was laid a beggar named Lazarus, covered with sores</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span><span class="red">and longing to eat what fell from the rich man&#8217;s table. Even the dogs came and licked his sores.</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham&#8217;s side. The rich man also died and was buried.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span><span class="red">In Hades, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span><span class="red">So he called to him, &#8216;Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire.&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;But Abraham replied, &#8216;Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in agony.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span><span class="red">And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been set in place, so that those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;He answered, &#8216;Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my family,</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span><span class="red">for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.&#8217;</span></p>
