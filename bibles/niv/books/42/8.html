The Twelve were with him, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases: Mary (called Magdalene) from whom seven demons had come out; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Joanna the wife of Chuza, the manager of Herod&#8217;s household; Susanna; and many others. These women were helping to support them out of their own means.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from town after town, he told this parable: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path; it was trampled on, and the birds ate it up.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span><span class="red">Some fell on rocky ground, and when it came up, the plants withered because they had no moisture.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span><span class="red">Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the plants.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><span class="red">Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up and yielded a crop, a hundred times more than was sown.&#8221;</span></p><p class="reg">When he said this, he called out, <span class="red">&#8220;Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>His disciples asked him what this parable meant. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>He said, <span class="red">&#8220;The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to others I speak in parables, so that,</span></p><div class="stanza"><p class="line1"><span class="red">&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;though seeing, they may not see;</span></p><p class="line2"><span class="red">though hearing, they may not understand.&#8217;

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;This is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span><span class="red">Those along the path are the ones who hear, and then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span><span class="red">Those on the rocky ground are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it, but they have no root. They believe for a while, but in the time of testing they fall away.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span><span class="red">The seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by life&#8217;s worries, riches and pleasures, and they do not mature.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span><span class="red">But the seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, retain it, and by persevering produce a crop.</span></p>
<p class="sectionhead">A Lamp on a Stand</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;No one lights a lamp and hides it in a clay jar or puts it under a bed. Instead, they put it on a stand, so that those who come in can see the light.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span><span class="red">For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be known or brought out into the open.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span><span class="red">Therefore consider carefully how you listen. Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what they think they have will be taken from them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="sectionhead">Jesus&#8217; Mother and Brothers</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Now Jesus&#8217; mother and brothers came to see him, but they were not able to get near him because of the crowd. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Someone told him, &#8220;Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p class="sectionhead">Jesus Calms the Storm</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>One day Jesus said to his disciples, <span class="red">&#8220;Let us go over to the other side of the lake.&#8221;</span> So they got into a boat and set out. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>As they sailed, he fell asleep. A squall came down on the lake, so that the boat was being swamped, and they were in great danger.</p>

 which is across the lake from Galilee. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>When Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a demon-possessed man from the town. For a long time this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house, but had lived in the tombs. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet, shouting at the top of his voice, &#8220;What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don&#8217;t torture me!&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>For Jesus had commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard, he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Jesus asked him, <span class="red">&#8220;What is your name?&#8221;</span></p><p class="reg">&#8220;Legion,&#8221; he replied, because many demons had gone into him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>And they begged Jesus repeatedly not to order them to go into the Abyss.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>A large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside. The demons begged Jesus to let them go into the pigs, and he gave them permission. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>When the demons came out of the man, they went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>and the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus&#8217; feet, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Those who had seen it told the people how the demon-possessed man had been cured. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>Then all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them, because they were overcome with fear. So he got into the boat and left.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,
