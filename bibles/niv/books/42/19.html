<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>A man was there by the name of Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector and was wealthy. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>He wanted to see who Jesus was, but because he was short he could not see over the crowd. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore-fig tree to see him, since Jesus was coming that way.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>When Jesus reached the spot, he looked up and said to him, <span class="red">&#8220;Zacchaeus, come down immediately. I must stay at your house today.&#8221;</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So he came down at once and welcomed him gladly.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Jesus said to him, <span class="red">&#8220;Today salvation has come to this house, because this man, too, is a son of Abraham.</span>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;But his subjects hated him and sent a delegation after him to say, &#8216;We don&#8217;t want this man to be our king.&#8217;</span></p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span><span class="red">Why then didn&#8217;t you put my money on deposit, so that when I came back, I could have collected it with interest?&#8217;</span></p>
