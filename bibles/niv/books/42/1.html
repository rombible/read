 among us, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>With this in mind, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, I too decided to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">The Birth of John the Baptist Foretold</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah; his wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Both of them were righteous in the sight of God, observing all the Lord&#8217;s commands and decrees blamelessly. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But they were childless because Elizabeth was not able to conceive, and they were both very old.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Once when Zechariah&#8217;s division was on duty and he was serving as priest before God, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to go into the temple of the Lord and burn incense. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And when the time for the burning of incense came, all the assembled worshipers were praying outside.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and was gripped with fear. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>But the angel said to him: &#8220;Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to call him John. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice because of his birth, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He is never to take wine or other fermented drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even before he is born. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>He will bring back many of the people of Israel to the Lord their God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>And he will go on before the Lord, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the parents to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous&#8212;to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Zechariah asked the angel, &#8220;How can I be sure of this? I am an old man and my wife is well along in years.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>The angel said to him, &#8220;I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And now you will be silent and not able to speak until the day this happens, because you did not believe my words, which will come true at their appointed time.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>When he came out, he could not speak to them. They realized he had seen a vision in the temple, for he kept making signs to them but remained unable to speak.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>When his time of service was completed, he returned home. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>After this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>&#8220;The Lord has done this for me,&#8221; she said. &#8220;In these days he has shown his favor and taken away my disgrace among the people.&#8221;</p>
<p class="sectionhead">The Birth of Jesus Foretold</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>In the sixth month of Elizabeth&#8217;s pregnancy, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The virgin&#8217;s name was Mary. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>The angel went to her and said, &#8220;Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>But the angel said to her, &#8220;Do not be afraid, Mary; you have found favor with God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to call him Jesus. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David,

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>&#8220;How will this be,&#8221; Mary asked the angel, &#8220;since I am a virgin?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>The angel answered, &#8220;The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called

 the Son of God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Even Elizabeth your relative is going to have a child in her old age, and she who was said to be unable to conceive is in her sixth month.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>&#8220;I am the Lord&#8217;s servant,&#8221; Mary answered. &#8220;May your word to me be fulfilled.&#8221; Then the angel left her.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Mary Visits Elizabeth</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>At that time Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judea,

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>When Elizabeth heard Mary&#8217;s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy.
