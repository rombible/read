<div class="chap"><p class="sectionhead">Paul and the False Apostles</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>I hope you will put up with me in a little foolishness. Yes, please put up with me! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy. I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might present you as a pure virgin to him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But I am afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the serpent&#8217;s cunning, your minds may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For if someone comes to you and preaches a Jesus other than the Jesus we preached, or if you receive a different spirit from the Spirit you received, or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it easily enough.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>I do not think I am in the least inferior to those &#8220;super-apostles.&#8221;
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or to the most eminent apostles">a</a></sup></span>
 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>I may indeed be untrained as a speaker, but I do have knowledge. We have made this perfectly clear to you in every way. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Was it a sin for me to lower myself in order to elevate you by preaching the gospel of God to you free of charge? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>I robbed other churches by receiving support from them so as to serve you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>And when I was with you and needed something, I was not a burden to anyone, for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied what I needed. I have kept myself from being a burden to you in any way, and will continue to do so. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>As surely as the truth of Christ is in me, nobody in the regions of Achaia will stop this boasting of mine. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And I will keep on doing what I am doing in order to cut the ground from under those who want an opportunity to be considered equal with us in the things they boast about. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>For such people are false apostles, deceitful workers, masquerading as apostles of Christ. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>It is not surprising, then, if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness. Their end will be what their actions deserve.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Paul Boasts About His Sufferings</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>I repeat: Let no one take me for a fool. But if you do, then tolerate me just as you would a fool, so that I may do a little boasting. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>In this self-confident boasting I am not talking as the Lord would, but as a fool. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Since many are boasting in the way the world does, I too will boast. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>You gladly put up with fools since you are so wise! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>In fact, you even put up with anyone who enslaves you or exploits you or takes advantage of you or puts on airs or slaps you in the face. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>To my shame I admit that we were too weak for that!</p><p class="reg">Whatever anyone else dares to boast about&#8212;I am speaking as a fool&#8212;I also dare to boast about. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they Abraham&#8217;s descendants? So am I. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Are they servants of Christ? (I am out of my mind to talk like this.) I am more. I have worked much harder, been in prison more frequently, been flogged more severely, and been exposed to death again and again. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was pelted with stones, three times I was shipwrecked, I spent a night and a day in the open sea, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>I have been constantly on the move. I have been in danger from rivers, in danger from bandits, in danger from my fellow Jews, in danger from Gentiles; in danger in the city, in danger in the country, in danger at sea; and in danger from false believers. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>I have labored and toiled and have often gone without sleep; I have known hunger and thirst and have often gone without food; I have been cold and naked. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Besides everything else, I face daily the pressure of my concern for all the churches. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Who is weak, and I do not feel weak? Who is led into sin, and I do not inwardly burn?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, who is to be praised forever, knows that I am not lying.
