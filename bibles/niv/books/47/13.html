<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Deut. 19:15">a</a></sup></span>
 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>I already gave you a warning when I was with you the second time. I now repeat it while absent: On my return I will not spare those who sinned earlier or any of the others, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>since you are demanding proof that Christ is speaking through me. He is not weak in dealing with you, but is powerful among you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For to be sure, he was crucified in weakness, yet he lives by God&#8217;s power. Likewise, we are weak in him, yet by God&#8217;s power we will live with him in our dealing with you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves. Do you not realize that Christ Jesus is in you&#8212;unless, of course, you fail the test? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And I trust that you will discover that we have not failed the test. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now we pray to God that you will not do anything wrong&#8212;not so that people will see that we have stood the test but so that you will do what is right even though we may seem to have failed. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>For we cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the truth. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>We are glad whenever we are weak but you are strong; and our prayer is that you may be fully restored. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>This is why I write these things when I am absent, that when I come I may not have to be harsh in my use of authority&#8212;the authority the Lord gave me for building you up, not for tearing you down.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Final Greetings</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Finally, brothers and sisters, rejoice! Strive for full restoration, encourage one another, be of one mind, live in peace. And the God of love and peace will be with you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Greet one another with a holy kiss. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>All God&#8217;s people here send their greetings.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><A name="footnotes"></a><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotebot">Deut.&#8239;19:15</span><br><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
