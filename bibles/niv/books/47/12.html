Although there is nothing to be gained, I will go on to visions and revelations from the Lord. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven. Whether it was in the body or out of the body I do not know&#8212;God knows. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And I know that this man&#8212;whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know, but God knows&#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>was caught up to paradise and heard inexpressible things, things that no one is permitted to tell. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>I will boast about a man like that, but I will not boast about myself, except about my weaknesses. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Even if I should choose to boast, I would not be a fool, because I would be speaking the truth. But I refrain, so no one will think more of me than is warranted by what I do or say, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>or because of these surpassingly great revelations. Therefore, in order to keep me from becoming conceited, I was given a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to torment me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But he said to me, <span class="red">&#8220;My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.&#8221;</span> Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ&#8217;s power may rest on me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>That is why, for Christ&#8217;s sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Paul&#8217;s Concern for the Corinthians</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>I have made a fool of myself, but you drove me to it. I ought to have been commended by you, for I am not in the least inferior to the &#8220;super-apostles,&#8221;
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or the most eminent apostles">a</a></sup></span>
 even though I am nothing. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>I persevered in demonstrating among you the marks of a true apostle, including signs, wonders and miracles. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>How were you inferior to the other churches, except that I was never a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Now I am ready to visit you for the third time, and I will not be a burden to you, because what I want is not your possessions but you. After all, children should not have to save up for their parents, but parents for their children. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So I will very gladly spend for you everything I have and expend myself as well. If I love you more, will you love me less? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Be that as it may, I have not been a burden to you. Yet, crafty fellow that I am, I caught you by trickery! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Did I exploit you through any of the men I sent to you? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>I urged Titus to go to you and I sent our brother with him. Titus did not exploit you, did he? Did we not walk in the same footsteps by the same Spirit?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Have you been thinking all along that we have been defending ourselves to you? We have been speaking in the sight of God as those in Christ; and everything we do, dear friends, is for your strengthening. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>For I am afraid that when I come I may not find you as I want you to be, and you may not find me as you want me to be. I fear that there may be discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, slander, gossip, arrogance and disorder. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>I am afraid that when I come again my God will humble me before you, and I will be grieved over many who have sinned earlier and have not repented of the impurity, sexual sin and debauchery in which they have indulged.</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><A name="footnotes"></a><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotebot">Or <i>the most eminent apostles</i></span><br><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
