<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>I beg you that when I come I may not have to be as bold as I expect to be toward some people who think that we live by the standards of this world. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>For though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world. On the contrary, they have divine power to demolish strongholds. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>And we will be ready to punish every act of disobedience, once your obedience is complete.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>You are judging by appearances.
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or Look at the obvious facts">a</a></sup></span>
 If anyone is confident that they belong to Christ, they should consider again that we belong to Christ just as much as they do. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So even if I boast somewhat freely about the authority the Lord gave us for building you up rather than tearing you down, I will not be ashamed of it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>I do not want to seem to be trying to frighten you with my letters. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For some say, &#8220;His letters are weighty and forceful, but in person he is unimpressive and his speaking amounts to nothing.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Such people should realize that what we are in our letters when we are absent, we will be in our actions when we are present.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>We do not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some who commend themselves. When they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, they are not wise. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>We, however, will not boast beyond proper limits, but will confine our boasting to the sphere of service God himself has assigned to us, a sphere that also includes you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>We are not going too far in our boasting, as would be the case if we had not come to you, for we did get as far as you with the gospel of Christ. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Neither do we go beyond our limits by boasting of work done by others. Our hope is that, as your faith continues to grow, our sphere of activity among you will greatly expand, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>so that we can preach the gospel in the regions beyond you. For we do not want to boast about work already done in someone else&#8217;s territory. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But, &#8220;Let the one who boasts boast in the Lord.&#8221;
