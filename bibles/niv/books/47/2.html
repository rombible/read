<div class="chap"><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>So I made up my mind that I would not make another painful visit to you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>For if I grieve you, who is left to make me glad but you whom I have grieved? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>I wrote as I did, so that when I came I would not be distressed by those who should have made me rejoice. I had confidence in all of you, that you would all share my joy. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>For I wrote you out of great distress and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to grieve you but to let you know the depth of my love for you.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Forgiveness for the Offender</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>If anyone has caused grief, he has not so much grieved me as he has grieved all of you to some extent&#8212;not to put it too severely. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>The punishment inflicted on him by the majority is sufficient. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now instead, you ought to forgive and comfort him, so that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>I urge you, therefore, to reaffirm your love for him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Another reason I wrote you was to see if you would stand the test and be obedient in everything. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Anyone you forgive, I also forgive. And what I have forgiven&#8212;if there was anything to forgive&#8212;I have forgiven in the sight of Christ for your sake, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>in order that Satan might not outwit us. For we are not unaware of his schemes.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Ministers of the New Covenant</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Now when I went to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ and found that the Lord had opened a door for me, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>I still had no peace of mind, because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I said goodbye to them and went on to Macedonia.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But thanks be to God, who always leads us as captives in Christ&#8217;s triumphal procession and uses us to spread the aroma of the knowledge of him everywhere. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>For we are to God the pleasing aroma of Christ among those who are being saved and those who are perishing. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>To the one we are an aroma that brings death; to the other, an aroma that brings life. And who is equal to such a task? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Unlike so many, we do not peddle the word of God for profit. On the contrary, in Christ we speak before God with sincerity, as those sent from God.</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
