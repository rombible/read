There will be a time of distress such as has not happened from the beginning of nations until then. But at that time your people&#8212;everyone whose name is found written in the book&#8212;will be delivered. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/12-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake: some to everlasting life, others to shame and everlasting contempt.

 will shine like the brightness of the heavens, and those who lead many to righteousness, like the stars for ever and ever. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/12-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But you, Daniel, roll up and seal the words of the scroll until the time of the end. Many will go here and there to increase knowledge.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/12-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then I, Daniel, looked, and there before me stood two others, one on this bank of the river and one on the opposite bank. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/12-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>One of them said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, &#8220;How long will it be before these astonishing things are fulfilled?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/12-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>The man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, lifted his right hand and his left hand toward heaven, and I heard him swear by him who lives forever, saying, &#8220;It will be for a time, times and half a time.

 When the power of the holy people has been finally broken, all these things will be completed.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/12-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>I heard, but I did not understand. So I asked, &#8220;My lord, what will the outcome of all this be?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/12-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>He replied, &#8220;Go your way, Daniel, because the words are rolled up and sealed until the time of the end.
