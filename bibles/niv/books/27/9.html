 kingdom&#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, understood from the Scriptures, according to the word of the <span class="name">Lord</span> given to Jeremiah the prophet, that the desolation of Jerusalem would last seventy years. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So I turned to the Lord God and pleaded with him in prayer and petition, in fasting, and in sackcloth and ashes.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>I prayed to the <span class="name">Lord</span> my God and confessed:</p><p class="emb">&#8220;Lord, the great and awesome God, who keeps his covenant of love with those who love him and keep his commandments, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>we have sinned and done wrong. We have been wicked and have rebelled; we have turned away from your commands and laws. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>We have not listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our princes and our ancestors, and to all the people of the land.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8220;Lord, you are righteous, but this day we are covered with shame&#8212;the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and all Israel, both near and far, in all the countries where you have scattered us because of our unfaithfulness to you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>We and our kings, our princes and our ancestors are covered with shame, <span class="name">Lord</span>, because we have sinned against you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>The Lord our God is merciful and forgiving, even though we have rebelled against him; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>we have not obeyed the <span class="name">Lord</span> our God or kept the laws he gave us through his servants the prophets. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>All Israel has transgressed your law and turned away, refusing to obey you.</p><p class="reg">&#8220;Therefore the curses and sworn judgments written in the Law of Moses, the servant of God, have been poured out on us, because we have sinned against you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>You have fulfilled the words spoken against us and against our rulers by bringing on us great disaster. Under the whole heaven nothing has ever been done like what has been done to Jerusalem. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Just as it is written in the Law of Moses, all this disaster has come on us, yet we have not sought the favor of the <span class="name">Lord</span> our God by turning from our sins and giving attention to your truth. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> did not hesitate to bring the disaster on us, for the <span class="name">Lord</span> our God is righteous in everything he does; yet we have not obeyed him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>&#8220;Now, Lord our God, who brought your people out of Egypt with a mighty hand and who made for yourself a name that endures to this day, we have sinned, we have done wrong. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Lord, in keeping with all your righteous acts, turn away your anger and your wrath from Jerusalem, your city, your holy hill. Our sins and the iniquities of our ancestors have made Jerusalem and your people an object of scorn to all those around us.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>&#8220;Now, our God, hear the prayers and petitions of your servant. For your sake, Lord, look with favor on your desolate sanctuary. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Give ear, our God, and hear; open your eyes and see the desolation of the city that bears your Name. We do not make requests of you because we are righteous, but because of your great mercy. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Lord, listen! Lord, forgive! Lord, hear and act! For your sake, my God, do not delay, because your city and your people bear your Name.&#8221;</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>while I was still in prayer, Gabriel, the man I had seen in the earlier vision, came to me in swift flight about the time of the evening sacrifice.
