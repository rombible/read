<p class="sectionhead">John the Baptist Beheaded</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>King Herod heard about this, for Jesus&#8217; name had become well known. Some were saying,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some early manuscripts He was saying">b</a></sup></span>
 &#8220;John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Others said, &#8220;He is Elijah.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">And still others claimed, &#8220;He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of long ago.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But when Herod heard this, he said, &#8220;John, whom I beheaded, has been raised from the dead!&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and he had him bound and put in prison. He did this because of Herodias, his brother Philip&#8217;s wife, whom he had married. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>For John had been saying to Herod, &#8220;It is not lawful for you to have your brother&#8217;s wife.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>So Herodias nursed a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she was not able to, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing him to be a righteous and holy man. When Herod heard John, he was greatly puzzled

; yet he liked to listen to him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Finally the opportune time came. On his birthday Herod gave a banquet for his high officials and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee.

 Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests.</p><p class="reg">The king said to the girl, &#8220;Ask me for anything you want, and I&#8217;ll give it to you.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And he promised her with an oath, &#8220;Whatever you ask I will give you, up to half my kingdom.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>She went out and said to her mother, &#8220;What shall I ask for?&#8221;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;The head of John the Baptist,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>At once the girl hurried in to the king with the request: &#8220;I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>The king was greatly distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he did not want to refuse her. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>So he immediately sent an executioner with orders to bring John&#8217;s head. The man went, beheaded John in the prison, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>and brought back his head on a platter. He presented it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>On hearing of this, John&#8217;s disciples came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Jesus Feeds the Five Thousand</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>The apostles gathered around Jesus and reported to him all they had done and taught.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>So they went away by themselves in a boat to a solitary place. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>But many who saw them leaving recognized them and ran on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began teaching them many things.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces of bread and fish. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>The number of the men who had eaten was five thousand.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Jesus Walks on the Water</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-45.htm"><b>45</b></a></span>Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-46.htm"><b>46</b></a></span>After leaving them, he went up on a mountainside to pray.</p>
