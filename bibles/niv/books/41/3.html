<div class="chap"><p class="sectionhead">Jesus Heals on the Sabbath</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Another time Jesus went into the synagogue, and a man with a shriveled hand was there. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Some of them were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Jesus said to the man with the shriveled hand, <span class="red">&#8220;Stand up in front of everyone.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then Jesus asked them, <span class="red">&#8220;Which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?&#8221;</span> But they remained silent.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>He looked around at them in anger and, deeply distressed at their stubborn hearts, said to the man, <span class="red">&#8220;Stretch out your hand.&#8221;</span> He stretched it out, and his hand was completely restored. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians how they might kill Jesus.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Crowds Follow Jesus</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the lake, and a large crowd from Galilee followed. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>When they heard about all he was doing, many people came to him from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, and the regions across the Jordan and around Tyre and Sidon. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Because of the crowd he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him, to keep the people from crowding him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>For he had healed many, so that those with diseases were pushing forward to touch him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Whenever the impure spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, &#8220;You are the Son of God.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But he gave them strict orders not to tell others about him.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Jesus Appoints the Twelve</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Jesus went up on a mountainside and called to him those he wanted, and they came to him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>He appointed twelve
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts twelve--designating them apostles--">a</a></sup></span>
 that they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and to have authority to drive out demons. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>These are the twelve he appointed: Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter), 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>James son of Zebedee and his brother John (to them he gave the name Boanerges, which means &#8220;sons of thunder&#8221;), 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Jesus Accused by His Family and by Teachers of the Law</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then Jesus entered a house, and again a crowd gathered, so that he and his disciples were not even able to eat. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>When his family
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or his associates">b</a></sup></span>
 heard about this, they went to take charge of him, for they said, &#8220;He is out of his mind.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And the teachers of the law who came down from Jerusalem said, &#8220;He is possessed by Beelzebul! By the prince of demons he is driving out demons.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>So Jesus called them over to him and began to speak to them in parables: <span class="red">&#8220;How can Satan drive out Satan?</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span><span class="red">If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span><span class="red">And if Satan opposes himself and is divided, he cannot stand; his end has come.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span><span class="red">In fact, no one can enter a strong man&#8217;s house without first tying him up. Then he can plunder the strong man&#8217;s house.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span><span class="red">Truly I tell you, people can be forgiven all their sins and every slander they utter,</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span><span class="red">but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; they are guilty of an eternal sin.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>He said this because they were saying, &#8220;He has an impure spirit.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Then Jesus&#8217; mother and brothers arrived. Standing outside, they sent someone in to call him.
