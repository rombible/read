<p class="sectionhead">The Transfiguration</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>After six days Jesus took Peter, James and John with him and led them up a high mountain, where they were all alone. There he was transfigured before them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>His clothes became dazzling white, whiter than anyone in the world could bleach them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And there appeared before them Elijah and Moses, who were talking with Jesus.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Peter said to Jesus, &#8220;Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters&#8212;one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>(He did not know what to say, they were so frightened.)</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then a cloud appeared and covered them, and a voice came from the cloud: &#8220;This is my Son, whom I love. Listen to him!&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Suddenly, when they looked around, they no longer saw anyone with them except Jesus.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus gave them orders not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>They kept the matter to themselves, discussing what &#8220;rising from the dead&#8221; meant.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And they asked him, &#8220;Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Jesus replied, <span class="red">&#8220;To be sure, Elijah does come first, and restores all things. Why then is it written that the Son of Man must suffer much and be rejected?</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span><span class="red">But I tell you, Elijah has come, and they have done to him everything they wished, just as it is written about him.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="sectionhead">Jesus Heals a Boy Possessed by an Impure Spirit</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>When they came to the other disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and the teachers of the law arguing with them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>As soon as all the people saw Jesus, they were overwhelmed with wonder and ran to greet him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;What are you arguing with them about?&#8221;</span> he asked.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>A man in the crowd answered, &#8220;Teacher, I brought you my son, who is possessed by a spirit that has robbed him of speech. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Whenever it seizes him, it throws him to the ground. He foams at the mouth, gnashes his teeth and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to drive out the spirit, but they could not.&#8221;</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So they brought him. When the spirit saw Jesus, it immediately threw the boy into a convulsion. He fell to the ground and rolled around, foaming at the mouth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Jesus asked the boy&#8217;s father, <span class="red">&#8220;How long has he been like this?&#8221;</span></p><p class="reg">&#8220;From childhood,&#8221; he answered. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>&#8220;It has often thrown him into fire or water to kill him. But if you can do anything, take pity on us and help us.&#8221;</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Immediately the boy&#8217;s father exclaimed, &#8220;I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>When Jesus saw that a crowd was running to the scene, he rebuked the impure spirit. <span class="red">&#8220;You deaf and mute spirit,&#8221;</span> he said, <span class="red">&#8220;I command you, come out of him and never enter him again.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>The spirit shrieked, convulsed him violently and came out. The boy looked so much like a corpse that many said, &#8220;He&#8217;s dead.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him to his feet, and he stood up.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>After Jesus had gone indoors, his disciples asked him privately, &#8220;Why couldn&#8217;t we drive it out?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>He replied, <span class="red">&#8220;This kind can come out only by prayer.
