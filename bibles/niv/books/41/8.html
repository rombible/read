<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;I have compassion for these people; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span><span class="red">If I send them home hungry, they will collapse on the way, because some of them have come a long distance.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>His disciples answered, &#8220;But where in this remote place can anyone get enough bread to feed them?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;How many loaves do you have?&#8221;</span> Jesus asked.</p><p class="reg">&#8220;Seven,&#8221; they replied.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>He told the crowd to sit down on the ground. When he had taken the seven loaves and given thanks, he broke them and gave them to his disciples to distribute to the people, and they did so. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>They had a few small fish as well; he gave thanks for them also and told the disciples to distribute them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>The people ate and were satisfied. Afterward the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>About four thousand were present. After he had sent them away, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the region of Dalmanutha.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>The Pharisees came and began to question Jesus. To test him, they asked him for a sign from heaven. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>He sighed deeply and said, <span class="red">&#8220;Why does this generation ask for a sign? Truly I tell you, no sign will be given to it.&#8221;</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then he left them, got back into the boat and crossed to the other side.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">The Yeast of the Pharisees and Herod</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>The disciples had forgotten to bring bread, except for one loaf they had with them in the boat. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;Be careful,&#8221;</span> Jesus warned them. <span class="red">&#8220;Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and that of Herod.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>They discussed this with one another and said, &#8220;It is because we have no bread.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked them: <span class="red">&#8220;Why are you talking about having no bread? Do you still not see or understand? Are your hearts hardened?</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span><span class="red">Do you have eyes but fail to see, and ears but fail to hear? And don&#8217;t you remember?</span>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>He said to them, <span class="red">&#8220;Do you still not understand?&#8221;</span></p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>He took the blind man by the hand and led him outside the village. When he had spit on the man&#8217;s eyes and put his hands on him, Jesus asked, <span class="red">&#8220;Do you see anything?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>He looked up and said, &#8220;I see people; they look like trees walking around.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Once more Jesus put his hands on the man&#8217;s eyes. Then his eyes were opened, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Jesus sent him home, saying, <span class="red">&#8220;Don&#8217;t even go into

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>They replied, &#8220;Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, one of the prophets.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span><span class="red">&#8220;But what about you?&#8221;</span> he asked. <span class="red">&#8220;Who do you say I am?&#8221;</span></p><p class="reg">Peter answered, &#8220;You are the Messiah.&#8221;</p>
