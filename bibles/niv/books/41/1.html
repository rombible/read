<p class="sectionhead">The Baptism and Testing of Jesus</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.

<p class="sectionhead">Jesus Calls His First Disciples</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as the teachers of the law. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an impure spirit cried out,

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, &#8220;What is this? A new teaching&#8212;and with authority! He even gives orders to impure spirits and they obey him.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Jesus Heals Many</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>Jesus was indignant.
