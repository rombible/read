So they bound Jesus, led him away and handed him over to Pilate.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;Are you the king of the Jews?&#8221; asked Pilate.</p><p class="reg"><span class="red">&#8220;You have said so,&#8221;</span> Jesus replied.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>The chief priests accused him of many things. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So again Pilate asked him, &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you going to answer? See how many things they are accusing you of.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But Jesus still made no reply, and Pilate was amazed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Now it was the custom at the festival to release a prisoner whom the people requested. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>A man called Barabbas was in prison with the insurrectionists who had committed murder in the uprising. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>The crowd came up and asked Pilate to do for them what he usually did.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;Do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews?&#8221; asked Pilate, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>knowing it was out of self-interest that the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have Pilate release Barabbas instead.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>&#8220;What shall I do, then, with the one you call the king of the Jews?&#8221; Pilate asked them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8220;Crucify him!&#8221; they shouted.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>&#8220;Why? What crime has he committed?&#8221; asked Pilate.</p><p class="reg">But they shouted all the louder, &#8220;Crucify him!&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Wanting to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them. He had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">The Soldiers Mock Jesus</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>The soldiers led Jesus away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium) and called together the whole company of soldiers. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>They put a purple robe on him, then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And they began to call out to him, &#8220;Hail, king of the Jews!&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Again and again they struck him on the head with a staff and spit on him. Falling on their knees, they paid homage to him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him out to crucify him.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">The Crucifixion of Jesus</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>A certain man from Cyrene, Simon, the father of Alexander and Rufus, was passing by on his way in from the country, and they forced him to carry the cross. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>They brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha (which means &#8220;the place of the skull&#8221;). 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Then they offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And they crucified him. Dividing up his clothes, they cast lots to see what each would get.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>It was nine in the morning when they crucified him.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>In the same way the chief priests and the teachers of the law mocked him among themselves. &#8220;He saved others,&#8221; they said, &#8220;but he can&#8217;t save himself!
