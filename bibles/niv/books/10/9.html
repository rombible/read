<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Now there was a servant of Saul&#8217;s household named Ziba. They summoned him to appear before David, and the king said to him, &#8220;Are you Ziba?&#8221;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;At your service,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>The king asked, &#8220;Is there no one still alive from the house of Saul to whom I can show God&#8217;s kindness?&#8221;</p><p class="reg">Ziba answered the king, &#8220;There is still a son of Jonathan; he is lame in both feet.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8220;Where is he?&#8221; the king asked.</p><p class="reg">Ziba answered, &#8220;He is at the house of Makir son of Ammiel in Lo Debar.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So King David had him brought from Lo Debar, from the house of Makir son of Ammiel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>When Mephibosheth son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came to David, he bowed down to pay him honor.</p><p class="reg">David said, &#8220;Mephibosheth!&#8221;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;At your service,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid,&#8221; David said to him, &#8220;for I will surely show you kindness for the sake of your father Jonathan. I will restore to you all the land that belonged to your grandfather Saul, and you will always eat at my table.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Mephibosheth bowed down and said, &#8220;What is your servant, that you should notice a dead dog like me?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then the king summoned Ziba, Saul&#8217;s steward, and said to him, &#8220;I have given your master&#8217;s grandson everything that belonged to Saul and his family. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>You and your sons and your servants are to farm the land for him and bring in the crops, so that your master&#8217;s grandson may be provided for. And Mephibosheth, grandson of your master, will always eat at my table.&#8221; (Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.)</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then Ziba said to the king, &#8220;Your servant will do whatever my lord the king commands his servant to do.&#8221; So Mephibosheth ate at David&#8217;s
