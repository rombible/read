The <span class="name">Lord</span> said, &#8220;It is on account of Saul and his blood-stained house; it is because he put the Gibeonites to death.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>The king summoned the Gibeonites and spoke to them. (Now the Gibeonites were not a part of Israel but were survivors of the Amorites; the Israelites had sworn to spare them, but Saul in his zeal for Israel and Judah had tried to annihilate them.) 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>David asked the Gibeonites, &#8220;What shall I do for you? How shall I make atonement so that you will bless the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s inheritance?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>The Gibeonites answered him, &#8220;We have no right to demand silver or gold from Saul or his family, nor do we have the right to put anyone in Israel to death.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;What do you want me to do for you?&#8221; David asked.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>They answered the king, &#8220;As for the man who destroyed us and plotted against us so that we have been decimated and have no place anywhere in Israel, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>let seven of his male descendants be given to us to be killed and their bodies exposed before the <span class="name">Lord</span> at Gibeah of Saul&#8212;the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s chosen one.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">So the king said, &#8220;I will give them to you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>The king spared Mephibosheth son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, because of the oath before the <span class="name">Lord</span> between David and Jonathan son of Saul. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But the king took Armoni and Mephibosheth, the two sons of Aiah&#8217;s daughter Rizpah, whom she had borne to Saul, together with the five sons of Saul&#8217;s daughter Merab,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Two Hebrew manuscripts, some Septuagint manuscripts and Syriac (see also 1 Samuel 18:19); most Hebrew and Septuagint manuscripts Michal">a</a></sup></span>
 whom she had borne to Adriel son of Barzillai the Meholathite. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>He handed them over to the Gibeonites, who killed them and exposed their bodies on a hill before the <span class="name">Lord</span>. All seven of them fell together; they were put to death during the first days of the harvest, just as the barley harvest was beginning.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Rizpah daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it out for herself on a rock. From the beginning of the harvest till the rain poured down from the heavens on the bodies, she did not let the birds touch them by day or the wild animals by night. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>When David was told what Aiah&#8217;s daughter Rizpah, Saul&#8217;s concubine, had done, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>he went and took the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from the citizens of Jabesh Gilead. (They had stolen their bodies from the public square at Beth Shan, where the Philistines had hung them after they struck Saul down on Gilboa.) 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>David brought the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from there, and the bones of those who had been killed and exposed were gathered up.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>They buried the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan in the tomb of Saul&#8217;s father Kish, at Zela in Benjamin, and did everything the king commanded. After that, God answered prayer in behalf of the land.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Wars Against the Philistines</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Once again there was a battle between the Philistines and Israel. David went down with his men to fight against the Philistines, and he became exhausted. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And Ishbi-Benob, one of the descendants of Rapha, whose bronze spearhead weighed three hundred shekels

 and who was armed with a new sword, said he would kill David. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But Abishai son of Zeruiah came to David&#8217;s rescue; he struck the Philistine down and killed him.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>In the course of time, there was another battle with the Philistines, at Gob. At that time Sibbekai the Hushathite killed Saph, one of the descendants of Rapha.</p>
