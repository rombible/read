 with him, &#8220;Go throughout the tribes of Israel from Dan to Beersheba and enroll the fighting men, so that I may know how many there are.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But Joab replied to the king, &#8220;May the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God multiply the troops a hundred times over, and may the eyes of my lord the king see it.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then they went toward the fortress of Tyre and all the towns of the Hivites and Canaanites. Finally, they went on to Beersheba in the Negev of Judah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>After they had gone through the entire land, they came back to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Joab reported the number of the fighting men to the king: In Israel there were eight hundred thousand able-bodied men who could handle a sword, and in Judah five hundred thousand.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>David was conscience-stricken after he had counted the fighting men, and he said to the <span class="name">Lord</span>, &#8220;I have sinned greatly in what I have done.

 years of famine in your land? Or three months of fleeing from your enemies while they pursue you? Or three days of plague in your land? Now then, think it over and decide how I should answer the one who sent me.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>David said to Gad, &#8220;I am in deep distress. Let us fall into the hands of the <span class="name">Lord</span>, for his mercy is great; but do not let me fall into human hands.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So the <span class="name">Lord</span> sent a plague on Israel from that morning until the end of the time designated, and seventy thousand of the people from Dan to Beersheba died.
