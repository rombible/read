<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>In the past, while Saul was king over us, you were the one who led Israel on their military campaigns. And the <span class="name">Lord</span> said to you, &#8216;You will shepherd my people Israel, and you will become their ruler.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>When all the elders of Israel had come to King David at Hebron, the king made a covenant with them at Hebron before the <span class="name">Lord</span>, and they anointed David king over Israel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>David was thirty years old when he became king, and he reigned forty years. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned over all Israel and Judah thirty-three years.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">David Conquers Jerusalem</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>The king and his men marched to Jerusalem to attack the Jebusites, who lived there. The Jebusites said to David, &#8220;You will not get in here; even the blind and the lame can ward you off.&#8221; They thought, &#8220;David cannot get in here.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Nevertheless, David captured the fortress of Zion&#8212;which is the City of David.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>On that day David had said, &#8220;Anyone who conquers the Jebusites will have to use the water shaft to reach those &#8216;lame and blind&#8217; who are David&#8217;s enemies.

&#8221; That is why they say, &#8220;The &#8216;blind and lame&#8217; will not enter the palace.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>David then took up residence in the fortress and called it the City of David. He built up the area around it, from the terraces

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>And he became more and more powerful, because the <span class="name">Lord</span> God Almighty was with him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now Hiram king of Tyre sent envoys to David, along with cedar logs and carpenters and stonemasons, and they built a palace for David. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then David knew that the <span class="name">Lord</span> had established him as king over Israel and had exalted his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>After he left Hebron, David took more concubines and wives in Jerusalem, and more sons and daughters were born to him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>These are the names of the children born to him there: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,

<p class="sectionhead">David Defeats the Philistines</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over Israel, they went up in full force to search for him, but David heard about it and went down to the stronghold. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Now the Philistines had come and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>so David inquired of the <span class="name">Lord</span>, &#8220;Shall I go and attack the Philistines? Will you deliver them into my hands?&#8221;</p><p class="reg">The <span class="name">Lord</span> answered him, &#8220;Go, for I will surely deliver the Philistines into your hands.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>So David went to Baal Perazim, and there he defeated them. He said, &#8220;As waters break out, the <span class="name">Lord</span> has broken out against my enemies before me.&#8221; So that place was called Baal Perazim.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>The Philistines abandoned their idols there, and David and his men carried them off.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>so David inquired of the <span class="name">Lord</span>, and he answered, &#8220;Do not go straight up, but circle around behind them and attack them in front of the poplar trees. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>As soon as you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the poplar trees, move quickly, because that will mean the <span class="name">Lord</span> has gone out in front of you to strike the Philistine army.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>So David did as the <span class="name">Lord</span> commanded him, and he struck down the Philistines all the way from Gibeon
