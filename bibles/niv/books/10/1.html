<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>On the third day a man arrived from Saul&#8217;s camp with his clothes torn and dust on his head. When he came to David, he fell to the ground to pay him honor.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8220;Where have you come from?&#8221; David asked him.</p><p class="reg">He answered, &#8220;I have escaped from the Israelite camp.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8220;What happened?&#8221; David asked. &#8220;Tell me.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;The men fled from the battle,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Many of them fell and died. And Saul and his son Jonathan are dead.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then David said to the young man who brought him the report, &#8220;How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>&#8220;I happened to be on Mount Gilboa,&#8221; the young man said, &#8220;and there was Saul, leaning on his spear, with the chariots and their drivers in hot pursuit. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>When he turned around and saw me, he called out to me, and I said, &#8216;What can I do?&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8220;He asked me, &#8216;Who are you?&#8217;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;An Amalekite,&#8217; I answered.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;Then he said to me, &#8216;Stand here by me and kill me! I&#8217;m in the throes of death, but I&#8217;m still alive.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8220;So I stood beside him and killed him, because I knew that after he had fallen he could not survive. And I took the crown that was on his head and the band on his arm and have brought them here to my lord.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then David and all the men with him took hold of their clothes and tore them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>They mourned and wept and fasted till evening for Saul and his son Jonathan, and for the army of the <span class="name">Lord</span> and for the nation of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>David said to the young man who brought him the report, &#8220;Where are you from?&#8221;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;I am the son of a foreigner, an Amalekite,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>David asked him, &#8220;Why weren&#8217;t you afraid to lift your hand to destroy the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s anointed?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then David called one of his men and said, &#8220;Go, strike him down!&#8221; So he struck him down, and he died. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>For David had said to him, &#8220;Your blood be on your own head. Your own mouth testified against you when you said, &#8216;I killed the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s anointed.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
