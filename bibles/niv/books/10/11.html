<div class="chap"><p class="sectionhead">David and Bathsheba</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>In the spring, at the time when kings go off to war, David sent Joab out with the king&#8217;s men and the whole Israelite army. They destroyed the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah. But David remained in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>One evening David got up from his bed and walked around on the roof of the palace. From the roof he saw a woman bathing. The woman was very beautiful, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and David sent someone to find out about her. The man said, &#8220;She is Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah the Hittite.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then David sent messengers to get her. She came to him, and he slept with her. (Now she was purifying herself from her monthly uncleanness.) Then she went back home. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>The woman conceived and sent word to David, saying, &#8220;I am pregnant.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>So David sent this word to Joab: &#8220;Send me Uriah the Hittite.&#8221; And Joab sent him to David. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>When Uriah came to him, David asked him how Joab was, how the soldiers were and how the war was going. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then David said to Uriah, &#8220;Go down to your house and wash your feet.&#8221; So Uriah left the palace, and a gift from the king was sent after him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But Uriah slept at the entrance to the palace with all his master&#8217;s servants and did not go down to his house.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>David was told, &#8220;Uriah did not go home.&#8221; So he asked Uriah, &#8220;Haven&#8217;t you just come from a military campaign? Why didn&#8217;t you go home?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Uriah said to David, &#8220;The ark and Israel and Judah are staying in tents,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or staying at Sukkoth">a</a></sup></span>
 and my commander Joab and my lord&#8217;s men are camped in the open country. How could I go to my house to eat and drink and make love to my wife? As surely as you live, I will not do such a thing!&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then David said to him, &#8220;Stay here one more day, and tomorrow I will send you back.&#8221; So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the next. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>At David&#8217;s invitation, he ate and drank with him, and David made him drunk. But in the evening Uriah went out to sleep on his mat among his master&#8217;s servants; he did not go home.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>In the morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it with Uriah. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>In it he wrote, &#8220;Put Uriah out in front where the fighting is fiercest. Then withdraw from him so he will be struck down and die.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So while Joab had the city under siege, he put Uriah at a place where he knew the strongest defenders were. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>When the men of the city came out and fought against Joab, some of the men in David&#8217;s army fell; moreover, Uriah the Hittite died.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Joab sent David a full account of the battle. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>He instructed the messenger: &#8220;When you have finished giving the king this account of the battle, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>the king&#8217;s anger may flare up, and he may ask you, &#8216;Why did you get so close to the city to fight? Didn&#8217;t you know they would shoot arrows from the wall? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Who killed Abimelek son of Jerub-Besheth
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Also known as Jerub-Baal (that is, Gideon)">b</a></sup></span>
? Didn&#8217;t a woman drop an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died in Thebez? Why did you get so close to the wall?&#8217; If he asks you this, then say to him, &#8216;Moreover, your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>The messenger set out, and when he arrived he told David everything Joab had sent him to say. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>The messenger said to David, &#8220;The men overpowered us and came out against us in the open, but we drove them back to the entrance of the city gate. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then the archers shot arrows at your servants from the wall, and some of the king&#8217;s men died. Moreover, your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>David told the messenger, &#8220;Say this to Joab: &#8216;Don&#8217;t let this upset you; the sword devours one as well as another. Press the attack against the city and destroy it.&#8217; Say this to encourage Joab.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>When Uriah&#8217;s wife heard that her husband was dead, she mourned for him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>After the time of mourning was over, David had her brought to his house, and she became his wife and bore him a son.
