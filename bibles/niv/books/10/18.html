<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>David sent out his troops, a third under the command of Joab, a third under Joab&#8217;s brother Abishai son of Zeruiah, and a third under Ittai the Gittite. The king told the troops, &#8220;I myself will surely march out with you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But the men said, &#8220;You must not go out; if we are forced to flee, they won&#8217;t care about us. Even if half of us die, they won&#8217;t care; but you are worth ten thousand of us.

 It would be better now for you to give us support from the city.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>The king answered, &#8220;I will do whatever seems best to you.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">So the king stood beside the gate while all his men marched out in units of hundreds and of thousands. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>The king commanded Joab, Abishai and Ittai, &#8220;Be gentle with the young man Absalom for my sake.&#8221; And all the troops heard the king giving orders concerning Absalom to each of the commanders.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>David&#8217;s army marched out of the city to fight Israel, and the battle took place in the forest of Ephraim. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>There Israel&#8217;s troops were routed by David&#8217;s men, and the casualties that day were great&#8212;twenty thousand men. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>The battle spread out over the whole countryside, and the forest swallowed up more men that day than the sword.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Now Absalom happened to meet David&#8217;s men. He was riding his mule, and as the mule went under the thick branches of a large oak, Absalom&#8217;s hair got caught in the tree. He was left hanging in midair, while the mule he was riding kept on going.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>When one of the men saw what had happened, he told Joab, &#8220;I just saw Absalom hanging in an oak tree.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Joab said to the man who had told him this, &#8220;What! You saw him? Why didn&#8217;t you strike him to the ground right there? Then I would have had to give you ten shekels
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, about 4 ounces or about 115 grams">b</a></sup></span>
 of silver and a warrior&#8217;s belt.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But the man replied, &#8220;Even if a thousand shekels

 were weighed out into my hands, I would not lay a hand on the king&#8217;s son. In our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, &#8216;Protect the young man Absalom for my sake.
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="A few Hebrew manuscripts, Septuagint, Vulgate and Syriac; most Hebrew manuscripts may be translated Absalom, whoever you may be.">d</a></sup></span>
&#8217;

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Joab said, &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to wait like this for you.&#8221; So he took three javelins in his hand and plunged them into Absalom&#8217;s heart while Absalom was still alive in the oak tree. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And ten of Joab&#8217;s armor-bearers surrounded Absalom, struck him and killed him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then Joab sounded the trumpet, and the troops stopped pursuing Israel, for Joab halted them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>They took Absalom, threw him into a big pit in the forest and piled up a large heap of rocks over him. Meanwhile, all the Israelites fled to their homes.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>During his lifetime Absalom had taken a pillar and erected it in the King&#8217;s Valley as a monument to himself, for he thought, &#8220;I have no son to carry on the memory of my name.&#8221; He named the pillar after himself, and it is called Absalom&#8217;s Monument to this day.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">David Mourns</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Now Ahimaaz son of Zadok said, &#8220;Let me run and take the news to the king that the <span class="name">Lord</span> has vindicated him by delivering him from the hand of his enemies.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>&#8220;You are not the one to take the news today,&#8221; Joab told him. &#8220;You may take the news another time, but you must not do so today, because the king&#8217;s son is dead.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then Joab said to a Cushite, &#8220;Go, tell the king what you have seen.&#8221; The Cushite bowed down before Joab and ran off.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>The king asked, &#8220;Is the young man Absalom safe?&#8221;</p><p class="reg">Ahimaaz answered, &#8220;I saw great confusion just as Joab was about to send the king&#8217;s servant and me, your servant, but I don&#8217;t know what it was.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>The king said, &#8220;Stand aside and wait here.&#8221; So he stepped aside and stood there.</p>
