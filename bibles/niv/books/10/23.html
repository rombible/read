<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Next to him was Eleazar son of Dodai the Ahohite. As one of the three mighty warriors, he was with David when they taunted the Philistines gathered at Pas Dammim

 for battle. Then the Israelites retreated,

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Next to him was Shammah son of Agee the Hararite. When the Philistines banded together at a place where there was a field full of lentils, Israel&#8217;s troops fled from them.
