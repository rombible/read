<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philemon/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>also to Apphia our sister and Archippus our fellow soldier&#8212;and to the church that meets in your home:</p>
<p class="opening"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philemon/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Grace and peace to you
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="The Greek is plural; also in verses 22 and 25; elsewhere in this letter ''you'' is singular.">a</a></sup></span>
 from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Thanksgiving and Prayer</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philemon/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philemon/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>because I hear about your love for all his holy people and your faith in the Lord Jesus. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philemon/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>I pray that your partnership with us in the faith may be effective in deepening your understanding of every good thing we share for the sake of Christ. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philemon/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Your love has given me great joy and encouragement, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the Lord&#8217;s people.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Paul&#8217;s Plea for Onesimus</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philemon/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Therefore, although in Christ I could be bold and order you to do what you ought to do, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philemon/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>yet I prefer to appeal to you on the basis of love. It is as none other than Paul&#8212;an old man and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus&#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philemon/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>that I appeal to you for my son Onesimus,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Onesimus means useful.">b</a></sup></span>
 who became my son while I was in chains. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philemon/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Formerly he was useless to you, but now he has become useful both to you and to me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philemon/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>I am sending him&#8212;who is my very heart&#8212;back to you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philemon/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>I would have liked to keep him with me so that he could take your place in helping me while I am in chains for the gospel. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philemon/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that any favor you do would not seem forced but would be voluntary. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philemon/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was that you might have him back forever&#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philemon/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a dear brother. He is very dear to me but even dearer to you, both as a fellow man and as a brother in the Lord.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philemon/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philemon/1-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>If he has done you any wrong or owes you anything, charge it to me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philemon/1-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand. I will pay it back&#8212;not to mention that you owe me your very self. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philemon/1-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>I do wish, brother, that I may have some benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philemon/1-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I ask.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/philemon/1-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And one thing more: Prepare a guest room for me, because I hope to be restored to you in answer to your prayers.</p>
