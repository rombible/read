<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Because the power of Midian was so oppressive, the Israelites prepared shelters for themselves in mountain clefts, caves and strongholds. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Whenever the Israelites planted their crops, the Midianites, Amalekites and other eastern peoples invaded the country. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>They camped on the land and ruined the crops all the way to Gaza and did not spare a living thing for Israel, neither sheep nor cattle nor donkeys. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>They came up with their livestock and their tents like swarms of locusts. It was impossible to count them or their camels; they invaded the land to ravage it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Midian so impoverished the Israelites that they cried out to the <span class="name">Lord</span> for help.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>When the Israelites cried out to the <span class="name">Lord</span> because of Midian, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>he sent them a prophet, who said, &#8220;This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, says: I brought you up out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>I rescued you from the hand of the Egyptians. And I delivered you from the hand of all your oppressors; I drove them out before you and gave you their land. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>I said to you, &#8216;I am the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God; do not worship the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you live.&#8217; But you have not listened to me.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>The angel of the <span class="name">Lord</span> came and sat down under the oak in Ophrah that belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, where his son Gideon was threshing wheat in a winepress to keep it from the Midianites. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>When the angel of the <span class="name">Lord</span> appeared to Gideon, he said, &#8220;The <span class="name">Lord</span> is with you, mighty warrior.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8220;Pardon me, my lord,&#8221; Gideon replied, &#8220;but if the <span class="name">Lord</span> is with us, why has all this happened to us? Where are all his wonders that our ancestors told us about when they said, &#8216;Did not the <span class="name">Lord</span> bring us up out of Egypt?&#8217; But now the <span class="name">Lord</span> has abandoned us and given us into the hand of Midian.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> turned to him and said, &#8220;Go in the strength you have and save Israel out of Midian&#8217;s hand. Am I not sending you?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>&#8220;Pardon me, my lord,&#8221; Gideon replied, &#8220;but how can I save Israel? My clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my family.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> answered, &#8220;I will be with you, and you will strike down all the Midianites, leaving none alive.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Gideon replied, &#8220;If now I have found favor in your eyes, give me a sign that it is really you talking to me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Please do not go away until I come back and bring my offering and set it before you.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">And the <span class="name">Lord</span> said, &#8220;I will wait until you return.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Gideon went inside, prepared a young goat, and from an ephah
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, probably about 36 pounds or about 16 kilograms">a</a></sup></span>
 of flour he made bread without yeast. Putting the meat in a basket and its broth in a pot, he brought them out and offered them to him under the oak.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>The angel of God said to him, &#8220;Take the meat and the unleavened bread, place them on this rock, and pour out the broth.&#8221; And Gideon did so. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then the angel of the <span class="name">Lord</span> touched the meat and the unleavened bread with the tip of the staff that was in his hand. Fire flared from the rock, consuming the meat and the bread. And the angel of the <span class="name">Lord</span> disappeared. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>When Gideon realized that it was the angel of the <span class="name">Lord</span>, he exclaimed, &#8220;Alas, Sovereign <span class="name">Lord</span>! I have seen the angel of the <span class="name">Lord</span> face to face!&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>But the <span class="name">Lord</span> said to him, &#8220;Peace! Do not be afraid. You are not going to die.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>So Gideon built an altar to the <span class="name">Lord</span> there and called it The <span class="name">Lord</span> Is Peace. To this day it stands in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>That same night the <span class="name">Lord</span> said to him, &#8220;Take the second bull from your father&#8217;s herd, the one seven years old.
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or Take a full-grown, mature bull from your father's herd">b</a></sup></span>
 Tear down your father&#8217;s altar to Baal and cut down the Asherah pole
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, a wooden symbol of the goddess Asherah; also in verses 26, 28 and 30">c</a></sup></span>
 beside it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Then build a proper kind of
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or build with layers of stone an">d</a></sup></span>
 altar to the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God on the top of this height. Using the wood of the Asherah pole that you cut down, offer the second
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or full-grown; also in verse 28">e</a></sup></span>
 bull as a burnt offering.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>So Gideon took ten of his servants and did as the <span class="name">Lord</span> told him. But because he was afraid of his family and the townspeople, he did it at night rather than in the daytime.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>In the morning when the people of the town got up, there was Baal&#8217;s altar, demolished, with the Asherah pole beside it cut down and the second bull sacrificed on the newly built altar!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>They asked each other, &#8220;Who did this?&#8221;</p><p class="reg">When they carefully investigated, they were told, &#8220;Gideon son of Joash did it.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>The people of the town demanded of Joash, &#8220;Bring out your son. He must die, because he has broken down Baal&#8217;s altar and cut down the Asherah pole beside it.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>But Joash replied to the hostile crowd around him, &#8220;Are you going to plead Baal&#8217;s cause? Are you trying to save him? Whoever fights for him shall be put to death by morning! If Baal really is a god, he can defend himself when someone breaks down his altar.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>So because Gideon broke down Baal&#8217;s altar, they gave him the name Jerub-Baal
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Jerub-Baal probably means let Baal contend.">f</a></sup></span>
 that day, saying, &#8220;Let Baal contend with him.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>Now all the Midianites, Amalekites and other eastern peoples joined forces and crossed over the Jordan and camped in the Valley of Jezreel. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Then the Spirit of the <span class="name">Lord</span> came on Gideon, and he blew a trumpet, summoning the Abiezrites to follow him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>He sent messengers throughout Manasseh, calling them to arms, and also into Asher, Zebulun and Naphtali, so that they too went up to meet them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>Gideon said to God, &#8220;If you will save Israel by my hand as you have promised&#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>look, I will place a wool fleece on the threshing floor. If there is dew only on the fleece and all the ground is dry, then I will know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you said.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>And that is what happened. Gideon rose early the next day; he squeezed the fleece and wrung out the dew&#8212;a bowlful of water.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/6-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>Then Gideon said to God, &#8220;Do not be angry with me. Let me make just one more request.
