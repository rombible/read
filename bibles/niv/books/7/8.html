Why didn&#8217;t you call us when you went to fight Midian?&#8221; And they challenged him vigorously.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>But he answered them, &#8220;What have I accomplished compared to you? Aren&#8217;t the gleanings of Ephraim&#8217;s grapes better than the full grape harvest of Abiezer? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>God gave Oreb and Zeeb, the Midianite leaders, into your hands. What was I able to do compared to you?&#8221; At this, their resentment against him subsided.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Gideon and his three hundred men, exhausted yet keeping up the pursuit, came to the Jordan and crossed it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>He said to the men of Sukkoth, &#8220;Give my troops some bread; they are worn out, and I am still pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But the officials of Sukkoth said, &#8220;Do you already have the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna in your possession? Why should we give bread to your troops?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then Gideon replied, &#8220;Just for that, when the <span class="name">Lord</span> has given Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, I will tear your flesh with desert thorns and briers.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>From there he went up to Peniel
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew Penuel, a variant of Peniel; also in verses 9 and 17">a</a></sup></span>
 and made the same request of them, but they answered as the men of Sukkoth had. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>So he said to the men of Peniel, &#8220;When I return in triumph, I will tear down this tower.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with a force of about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of the armies of the eastern peoples; a hundred and twenty thousand swordsmen had fallen. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Gideon went up by the route of the nomads east of Nobah and Jogbehah and attacked the unsuspecting army. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Zebah and Zalmunna, the two kings of Midian, fled, but he pursued them and captured them, routing their entire army.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Gideon son of Joash then returned from the battle by the Pass of Heres. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>He caught a young man of Sukkoth and questioned him, and the young man wrote down for him the names of the seventy-seven officials of Sukkoth, the elders of the town. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Then Gideon came and said to the men of Sukkoth, &#8220;Here are Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you taunted me by saying, &#8216;Do you already have the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna in your possession? Why should we give bread to your exhausted men?&#8217;&#8239;&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>He took the elders of the town and taught the men of Sukkoth a lesson by punishing them with desert thorns and briers. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>He also pulled down the tower of Peniel and killed the men of the town.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then he asked Zebah and Zalmunna, &#8220;What kind of men did you kill at Tabor?&#8221;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;Men like you,&#8221; they answered, &#8220;each one with the bearing of a prince.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Gideon replied, &#8220;Those were my brothers, the sons of my own mother. As surely as the <span class="name">Lord</span> lives, if you had spared their lives, I would not kill you.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Turning to Jether, his oldest son, he said, &#8220;Kill them!&#8221; But Jether did not draw his sword, because he was only a boy and was afraid.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Zebah and Zalmunna said, &#8220;Come, do it yourself. &#8216;As is the man, so is his strength.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221; So Gideon stepped forward and killed them, and took the ornaments off their camels&#8217; necks.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Gideon&#8217;s Ephod</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>The Israelites said to Gideon, &#8220;Rule over us&#8212;you, your son and your grandson&#8212;because you have saved us from the hand of Midian.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>But Gideon told them, &#8220;I will not rule over you, nor will my son rule over you. The <span class="name">Lord</span> will rule over you.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>And he said, &#8220;I do have one request, that each of you give me an earring from your share of the plunder.&#8221; (It was the custom of the Ishmaelites to wear gold earrings.)</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>They answered, &#8220;We&#8217;ll be glad to give them.&#8221; So they spread out a garment, and each of them threw a ring from his plunder onto it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>The weight of the gold rings he asked for came to seventeen hundred shekels,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, about 43 pounds or about 20 kilograms">b</a></sup></span>
 not counting the ornaments, the pendants and the purple garments worn by the kings of Midian or the chains that were on their camels&#8217; necks. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Gideon made the gold into an ephod, which he placed in Ophrah, his town. All Israel prostituted themselves by worshiping it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and his family.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Gideon&#8217;s Death</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Thus Midian was subdued before the Israelites and did not raise its head again. During Gideon&#8217;s lifetime, the land had peace forty years.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Jerub-Baal son of Joash went back home to live. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>He had seventy sons of his own, for he had many wives.
