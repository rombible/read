<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/17-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>said to his mother, &#8220;The eleven hundred shekels
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, about 28 pounds or about 13 kilograms">a</a></sup></span>
 of silver that were taken from you and about which I heard you utter a curse&#8212;I have that silver with me; I took it.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">Then his mother said, &#8220;The <span class="name">Lord</span> bless you, my son!&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/17-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>When he returned the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, she said, &#8220;I solemnly consecrate my silver to the <span class="name">Lord</span> for my son to make an image overlaid with silver. I will give it back to you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/17-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So after he returned the silver to his mother, she took two hundred shekels
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, about 5 pounds or about 2.3 kilograms">b</a></sup></span>
 of silver and gave them to a silversmith, who used them to make the idol. And it was put in Micah&#8217;s house.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/17-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Now this man Micah had a shrine, and he made an ephod and some household gods and installed one of his sons as his priest.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/17-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>A young Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, who had been living within the clan of Judah, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/17-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>left that town in search of some other place to stay. On his way
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or To carry on his profession">c</a></sup></span>
 he came to Micah&#8217;s house in the hill country of Ephraim.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/17-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Micah asked him, &#8220;Where are you from?&#8221;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;I&#8217;m a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I&#8217;m looking for a place to stay.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/17-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then Micah said to him, &#8220;Live with me and be my father and priest, and I&#8217;ll give you ten shekels
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="That is, about 4 ounces or about 115 grams">d</a></sup></span>
 of silver a year, your clothes and your food.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/17-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So the Levite agreed to live with him, and the young man became like one of his sons to him.
