<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>A certain man of Zorah, named Manoah, from the clan of the Danites, had a wife who was childless, unable to give birth. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>The angel of the <span class="name">Lord</span> appeared to her and said, &#8220;You are barren and childless, but you are going to become pregnant and give birth to a son. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Now see to it that you drink no wine or other fermented drink and that you do not eat anything unclean. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>You will become pregnant and have a son whose head is never to be touched by a razor because the boy is to be a Nazirite, dedicated to God from the womb. He will take the lead in delivering Israel from the hands of the Philistines.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then the woman went to her husband and told him, &#8220;A man of God came to me. He looked like an angel of God, very awesome. I didn&#8217;t ask him where he came from, and he didn&#8217;t tell me his name. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But he said to me, &#8216;You will become pregnant and have a son. Now then, drink no wine or other fermented drink and do not eat anything unclean, because the boy will be a Nazirite of God from the womb until the day of his death.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then Manoah prayed to the <span class="name">Lord</span>: &#8220;Pardon your servant, Lord. I beg you to let the man of God you sent to us come again to teach us how to bring up the boy who is to be born.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>God heard Manoah, and the angel of God came again to the woman while she was out in the field; but her husband Manoah was not with her. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>The woman hurried to tell her husband, &#8220;He&#8217;s here! The man who appeared to me the other day!&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Manoah got up and followed his wife. When he came to the man, he said, &#8220;Are you the man who talked to my wife?&#8221;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;I am,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So Manoah asked him, &#8220;When your words are fulfilled, what is to be the rule that governs the boy&#8217;s life and work?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>The angel of the <span class="name">Lord</span> answered, &#8220;Your wife must do all that I have told her. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>She must not eat anything that comes from the grapevine, nor drink any wine or other fermented drink nor eat anything unclean. She must do everything I have commanded her.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Manoah said to the angel of the <span class="name">Lord</span>, &#8220;We would like you to stay until we prepare a young goat for you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>The angel of the <span class="name">Lord</span> replied, &#8220;Even though you detain me, I will not eat any of your food. But if you prepare a burnt offering, offer it to the <span class="name">Lord</span>.&#8221; (Manoah did not realize that it was the angel of the <span class="name">Lord</span>.)</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then Manoah inquired of the angel of the <span class="name">Lord</span>, &#8220;What is your name, so that we may honor you when your word comes true?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>He replied, &#8220;Why do you ask my name? It is beyond understanding.

&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then Manoah took a young goat, together with the grain offering, and sacrificed it on a rock to the <span class="name">Lord</span>. And the <span class="name">Lord</span> did an amazing thing while Manoah and his wife watched: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>As the flame blazed up from the altar toward heaven, the angel of the <span class="name">Lord</span> ascended in the flame. Seeing this, Manoah and his wife fell with their faces to the ground. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>When the angel of the <span class="name">Lord</span> did not show himself again to Manoah and his wife, Manoah realized that it was the angel of the <span class="name">Lord</span>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>&#8220;We are doomed to die!&#8221; he said to his wife. &#8220;We have seen God!&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/13-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>But his wife answered, &#8220;If the <span class="name">Lord</span> had meant to kill us, he would not have accepted a burnt offering and grain offering from our hands, nor shown us all these things or now told us this.&#8221;</p>
