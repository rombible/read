<div class="chap"><p class="sectionhead">The Israelites Punish the Benjamites</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Then all Israel from Dan to Beersheba and from the land of Gilead came together as one and assembled before the <span class="name">Lord</span> in Mizpah. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>The leaders of all the people of the tribes of Israel took their places in the assembly of God&#8217;s people, four hundred thousand men armed with swords. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>(The Benjamites heard that the Israelites had gone up to Mizpah.) Then the Israelites said, &#8220;Tell us how this awful thing happened.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So the Levite, the husband of the murdered woman, said, &#8220;I and my concubine came to Gibeah in Benjamin to spend the night. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>During the night the men of Gibeah came after me and surrounded the house, intending to kill me. They raped my concubine, and she died. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>I took my concubine, cut her into pieces and sent one piece to each region of Israel&#8217;s inheritance, because they committed this lewd and outrageous act in Israel. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Now, all you Israelites, speak up and tell me what you have decided to do.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>All the men rose up together as one, saying, &#8220;None of us will go home. No, not one of us will return to his house. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But now this is what we&#8217;ll do to Gibeah: We&#8217;ll go up against it in the order decided by casting lots. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>We&#8217;ll take ten men out of every hundred from all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred from a thousand, and a thousand from ten thousand, to get provisions for the army. Then, when the army arrives at Gibeah

 in Benjamin, it can give them what they deserve for this outrageous act done in Israel.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So all the Israelites got together and united as one against the city.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>The tribes of Israel sent messengers throughout the tribe of Benjamin, saying, &#8220;What about this awful crime that was committed among you? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Now turn those wicked men of Gibeah over to us so that we may put them to death and purge the evil from Israel.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">But the Benjamites would not listen to their fellow Israelites. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>From their towns they came together at Gibeah to fight against the Israelites. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>At once the Benjamites mobilized twenty-six thousand swordsmen from their towns, in addition to seven hundred able young men from those living in Gibeah. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Among all these soldiers there were seven hundred select troops who were left-handed, each of whom could sling a stone at a hair and not miss.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Israel, apart from Benjamin, mustered four hundred thousand swordsmen, all of them fit for battle.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>The Israelites went up to Bethel
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or to the house of God; also in verse 26">b</a></sup></span>
 and inquired of God. They said, &#8220;Who of us is to go up first to fight against the Benjamites?&#8221;</p><p class="reg">The <span class="name">Lord</span> replied, &#8220;Judah shall go first.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>The next morning the Israelites got up and pitched camp near Gibeah. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>The Israelites went out to fight the Benjamites and took up battle positions against them at Gibeah.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>But the Israelites encouraged one another and again took up their positions where they had stationed themselves the first day. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>The Israelites went up and wept before the <span class="name">Lord</span> until evening, and they inquired of the <span class="name">Lord</span>.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then the Israelites drew near to Benjamin the second day. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>This time, when the Benjamites came out from Gibeah to oppose them, they cut down another eighteen thousand Israelites, all of them armed with swords.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Then all the Israelites, the whole army, went up to Bethel, and there they sat weeping before the <span class="name">Lord</span>.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>And the Israelites inquired of the <span class="name">Lord</span>. (In those days the ark of the covenant of God was there, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>with Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, ministering before it.)

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Then Israel set an ambush around Gibeah. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>They went up against the Benjamites on the third day and took up positions against Gibeah as they had done before. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>The Benjamites came out to meet them and were drawn away from the city.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>While the Benjamites were saying, &#8220;We are defeating them as before,&#8221; the Israelites were saying, &#8220;Let&#8217;s retreat and draw them away from the city to the roads.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>All the men of Israel moved from their places and took up positions at Baal Tamar, and the Israelite ambush charged out of its place on the west

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Then ten thousand of Israel&#8217;s able young men made a frontal attack on Gibeah. The fighting was so heavy that the Benjamites did not realize how near disaster was. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> defeated Benjamin before Israel, and on that day the Israelites struck down 25,100 Benjamites, all armed with swords.
