They said to Jephthah, &#8220;Why did you go to fight the Ammonites without calling us to go with you? We&#8217;re going to burn down your house over your head.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/12-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Jephthah answered, &#8220;I and my people were engaged in a great struggle with the Ammonites, and although I called, you didn&#8217;t save me out of their hands. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/12-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>When I saw that you wouldn&#8217;t help, I took my life in my hands and crossed over to fight the Ammonites, and the <span class="name">Lord</span> gave me the victory over them. Now why have you come up today to fight me?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/12-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Jephthah then called together the men of Gilead and fought against Ephraim. The Gileadites struck them down because the Ephraimites had said, &#8220;You Gileadites are renegades from Ephraim and Manasseh.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/12-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>The Gileadites captured the fords of the Jordan leading to Ephraim, and whenever a survivor of Ephraim said, &#8220;Let me cross over,&#8221; the men of Gilead asked him, &#8220;Are you an Ephraimite?&#8221; If he replied, &#8220;No,&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/12-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>they said, &#8220;All right, say &#8216;Shibboleth.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221; If he said, &#8220;Sibboleth,&#8221; because he could not pronounce the word correctly, they seized him and killed him at the fords of the Jordan. Forty-two thousand Ephraimites were killed at that time.</p>
