<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God: Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.

<p class="sectionhead">God&#8217;s Love and Ours</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Dear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>This is how we know that we live in him and he in us: He has given us of his Spirit. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/4-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/4-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/4-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And so we know and rely on the love God has for us.</p><p class="reg">God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/4-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>This is how love is made complete among us so that we will have confidence on the day of judgment: In this world we are like Jesus. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/4-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/4-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>We love because he first loved us. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/4-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Whoever claims to love God yet hates a brother or sister is a liar. For whoever does not love their brother and sister, whom they have seen, cannot love God, whom they have not seen. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/4-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And he has given us this command: Anyone who loves God must also love their brother and sister.</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><A name="footnotes"></a><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotebot">Or <i>spirit</i></span><br><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
