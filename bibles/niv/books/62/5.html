<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/5-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>This is how we know that we love the children of God: by loving God and carrying out his commands. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/5-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>In fact, this is love for God: to keep his commands. And his commands are not burdensome, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/5-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>for everyone born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world, even our faith. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/5-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Who is it that overcomes the world? Only the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/5-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>This is the one who came by water and blood&#8212;Jesus Christ. He did not come by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/5-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>For there are three that testify:

 Spirit, the water and the blood; and the three are in agreement. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/5-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>We accept human testimony, but God&#8217;s testimony is greater because it is the testimony of God, which he has given about his Son. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/5-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Whoever believes in the Son of God accepts this testimony. Whoever does not believe God has made him out to be a liar, because they have not believed the testimony God has given about his Son. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/5-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/5-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Concluding Affirmations</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/5-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/5-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/5-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>And if we know that he hears us&#8212;whatever we ask&#8212;we know that we have what we asked of him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/5-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>If you see any brother or sister commit a sin that does not lead to death, you should pray and God will give them life. I refer to those whose sin does not lead to death. There is a sin that leads to death. I am not saying that you should pray about that. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/5-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>All wrongdoing is sin, and there is sin that does not lead to death.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/5-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>We know that anyone born of God does not continue to sin; the One who was born of God keeps them safe, and the evil one cannot harm them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/5-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>We know that we are children of God, and that the whole world is under the control of the evil one. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/5-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>We know also that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may know him who is true. And we are in him who is true by being in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life.</p>
