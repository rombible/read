<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke. Then you are to put them in the ark.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So I made the ark out of acacia wood and chiseled out two stone tablets like the first ones, and I went up on the mountain with the two tablets in my hands. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> wrote on these tablets what he had written before, the Ten Commandments he had proclaimed to you on the mountain, out of the fire, on the day of the assembly.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then I came back down the mountain and put the tablets in the ark I had made, as the <span class="name">Lord</span> commanded me, and they are there now.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>(The Israelites traveled from the wells of Bene Jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died and was buried, and Eleazar his son succeeded him as priest. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>From there they traveled to Gudgodah and on to Jotbathah, a land with streams of water. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>At that time the <span class="name">Lord</span> set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the <span class="name">Lord</span>, to stand before the <span class="name">Lord</span> to minister and to pronounce blessings in his name, as they still do today. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>That is why the Levites have no share or inheritance among their fellow Israelites; the <span class="name">Lord</span> is their inheritance, as the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God told them.)</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Now I had stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights, as I did the first time, and the <span class="name">Lord</span> listened to me at this time also.
