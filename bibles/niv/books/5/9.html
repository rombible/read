<div class="chap"><p class="sectionhead">Not Because of Israel&#8217;s Righteousness</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Hear, Israel: You are now about to cross the Jordan to go in and dispossess nations greater and stronger than you, with large cities that have walls up to the sky. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>The people are strong and tall&#8212;Anakites! You know about them and have heard it said: &#8220;Who can stand up against the Anakites?&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But be assured today that the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God is the one who goes across ahead of you like a devouring fire. He will destroy them; he will subdue them before you. And you will drive them out and annihilate them quickly, as the <span class="name">Lord</span> has promised you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>After the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God has driven them out before you, do not say to yourself, &#8220;The <span class="name">Lord</span> has brought me here to take possession of this land because of my righteousness.&#8221; No, it is on account of the wickedness of these nations that the <span class="name">Lord</span> is going to drive them out before you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>It is not because of your righteousness or your integrity that you are going in to take possession of their land; but on account of the wickedness of these nations, the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God will drive them out before you, to accomplish what he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Understand, then, that it is not because of your righteousness that the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God is giving you this good land to possess, for you are a stiff-necked people.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">The Golden Calf</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Remember this and never forget how you aroused the anger of the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God in the wilderness. From the day you left Egypt until you arrived here, you have been rebellious against the <span class="name">Lord</span>. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>At Horeb you aroused the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s wrath so that he was angry enough to destroy you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>When I went up on the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant that the <span class="name">Lord</span> had made with you, I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights; I ate no bread and drank no water. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> gave me two stone tablets inscribed by the finger of God. On them were all the commandments the <span class="name">Lord</span> proclaimed to you on the mountain out of the fire, on the day of the assembly.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>At the end of the forty days and forty nights, the <span class="name">Lord</span> gave me the two stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then the <span class="name">Lord</span> told me, &#8220;Go down from here at once, because your people whom you brought out of Egypt have become corrupt. They have turned away quickly from what I commanded them and have made an idol for themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And the <span class="name">Lord</span> said to me, &#8220;I have seen this people, and they are a stiff-necked people indeed! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Let me alone, so that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven. And I will make you into a nation stronger and more numerous than they.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So I turned and went down from the mountain while it was ablaze with fire. And the two tablets of the covenant were in my hands. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>When I looked, I saw that you had sinned against the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God; you had made for yourselves an idol cast in the shape of a calf. You had turned aside quickly from the way that the <span class="name">Lord</span> had commanded you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So I took the two tablets and threw them out of my hands, breaking them to pieces before your eyes.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then once again I fell prostrate before the <span class="name">Lord</span> for forty days and forty nights; I ate no bread and drank no water, because of all the sin you had committed, doing what was evil in the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s sight and so arousing his anger. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>I feared the anger and wrath of the <span class="name">Lord</span>, for he was angry enough with you to destroy you. But again the <span class="name">Lord</span> listened to me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>And the <span class="name">Lord</span> was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him, but at that time I prayed for Aaron too. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Also I took that sinful thing of yours, the calf you had made, and burned it in the fire. Then I crushed it and ground it to powder as fine as dust and threw the dust into a stream that flowed down the mountain.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>You also made the <span class="name">Lord</span> angry at Taberah, at Massah and at Kibroth Hattaavah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>And when the <span class="name">Lord</span> sent you out from Kadesh Barnea, he said, &#8220;Go up and take possession of the land I have given you.&#8221; But you rebelled against the command of the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God. You did not trust him or obey him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>You have been rebellious against the <span class="name">Lord</span> ever since I have known you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>I lay prostrate before the <span class="name">Lord</span> those forty days and forty nights because the <span class="name">Lord</span> had said he would destroy you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>I prayed to the <span class="name">Lord</span> and said, &#8220;Sovereign <span class="name">Lord</span>, do not destroy your people, your own inheritance that you redeemed by your great power and brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Overlook the stubbornness of this people, their wickedness and their sin. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Otherwise, the country from which you brought us will say, &#8216;Because the <span class="name">Lord</span> was not able to take them into the land he had promised them, and because he hated them, he brought them out to put them to death in the wilderness.&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>But they are your people, your inheritance that you brought out by your great power and your outstretched arm.&#8221;</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
