They shall live on the food offerings presented to the <span class="name">Lord</span>, for that is their inheritance. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>They shall have no inheritance among their fellow Israelites; the <span class="name">Lord</span> is their inheritance, as he promised them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>This is the share due the priests from the people who sacrifice a bull or a sheep: the shoulder, the internal organs and the meat from the head. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>You are to give them the firstfruits of your grain, new wine and olive oil, and the first wool from the shearing of your sheep, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>for the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God has chosen them and their descendants out of all your tribes to stand and minister in the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s name always.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>If a Levite moves from one of your towns anywhere in Israel where he is living, and comes in all earnestness to the place the <span class="name">Lord</span> will choose, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>he may minister in the name of the <span class="name">Lord</span> his God like all his fellow Levites who serve there in the presence of the <span class="name">Lord</span>. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>He is to share equally in their benefits, even though he has received money from the sale of family possessions.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Occult Practices</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>When you enter the land the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God is giving you, do not learn to imitate the detestable ways of the nations there. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Let no one be found among you who sacrifices their son or daughter in the fire, who practices divination or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in witchcraft, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>or casts spells, or who is a medium or spiritist or who consults the dead. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Anyone who does these things is detestable to the <span class="name">Lord</span>; because of these same detestable practices the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God will drive out those nations before you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>You must be blameless before the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">The Prophet</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>The nations you will dispossess listen to those who practice sorcery or divination. But as for you, the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God has not permitted you to do so. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you, from your fellow Israelites. You must listen to him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>For this is what you asked of the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly when you said, &#8220;Let us not hear the voice of the <span class="name">Lord</span> our God nor see this great fire anymore, or we will die.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> said to me: &#8220;What they say is good. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their fellow Israelites, and I will put my words in his mouth. He will tell them everything I command him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>I myself will call to account anyone who does not listen to my words that the prophet speaks in my name. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>But a prophet who presumes to speak in my name anything I have not commanded, or a prophet who speaks in the name of other gods, is to be put to death.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>You may say to yourselves, &#8220;How can we know when a message has not been spoken by the <span class="name">Lord</span>?&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>If what a prophet proclaims in the name of the <span class="name">Lord</span> does not take place or come true, that is a message the <span class="name">Lord</span> has not spoken. That prophet has spoken presumptuously, so do not be alarmed.</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
