<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and when the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God has delivered them over to you and you have defeated them, then you must destroy them totally.
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="The Hebrew term refers to the irrevocable giving over of things or persons to the LORD, often by totally destroying them; also in verse 26.">a</a></sup></span>
 Make no treaty with them, and show them no mercy. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Do not intermarry with them. Do not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>for they will turn your children away from following me to serve other gods, and the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s anger will burn against you and will quickly destroy you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>This is what you are to do to them: Break down their altars, smash their sacred stones, cut down their Asherah poles

 and burn their idols in the fire. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>For you are a people holy to the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God. The <span class="name">Lord</span> your God has chosen you out of all the peoples on the face of the earth to be his people, his treasured possession.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> did not set his affection on you and choose you because you were more numerous than other peoples, for you were the fewest of all peoples. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But it was because the <span class="name">Lord</span> loved you and kept the oath he swore to your ancestors that he brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you from the land of slavery, from the power of Pharaoh king of Egypt. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Know therefore that the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God is God; he is the faithful God, keeping his covenant of love to a thousand generations of those who love him and keep his commandments. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>But</p><div class="stanza"><p class="line1">those who hate him he will repay to their face by destruction;</p><p class="line2">he will not be slow to repay to their face those who hate him.</p></div>
<p class="pcontinued"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Therefore, take care to follow the commands, decrees and laws I give you today.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>If you pay attention to these laws and are careful to follow them, then the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God will keep his covenant of love with you, as he swore to your ancestors. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>He will love you and bless you and increase your numbers. He will bless the fruit of your womb, the crops of your land&#8212;your grain, new wine and olive oil&#8212;the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks in the land he swore to your ancestors to give you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>You will be blessed more than any other people; none of your men or women will be childless, nor will any of your livestock be without young. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> will keep you free from every disease. He will not inflict on you the horrible diseases you knew in Egypt, but he will inflict them on all who hate you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>You must destroy all the peoples the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God gives over to you. Do not look on them with pity and do not serve their gods, for that will be a snare to you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>You may say to yourselves, &#8220;These nations are stronger than we are. How can we drive them out?&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>But do not be afraid of them; remember well what the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>You saw with your own eyes the great trials, the signs and wonders, the mighty hand and outstretched arm, with which the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God brought you out.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Moreover, the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God will send the hornet among them until even the survivors who hide from you have perished. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Do not be terrified by them, for the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God, who is among you, is a great and awesome God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> your God will drive out those nations before you, little by little. You will not be allowed to eliminate them all at once, or the wild animals will multiply around you.
