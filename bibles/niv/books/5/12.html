<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Destroy completely all the places on the high mountains, on the hills and under every spreading tree, where the nations you are dispossessing worship their gods. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Break down their altars, smash their sacred stones and burn their Asherah poles in the fire; cut down the idols of their gods and wipe out their names from those places.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>You must not worship the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God in their way. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>But you are to seek the place the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God will choose from among all your tribes to put his Name there for his dwelling. To that place you must go; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>there bring your burnt offerings and sacrifices, your tithes and special gifts, what you have vowed to give and your freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your herds and flocks. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>There, in the presence of the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God, you and your families shall eat and shall rejoice in everything you have put your hand to, because the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God has blessed you.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>But you will cross the Jordan and settle in the land the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God is giving you as an inheritance, and he will give you rest from all your enemies around you so that you will live in safety. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then to the place the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God will choose as a dwelling for his Name&#8212;there you are to bring everything I command you: your burnt offerings and sacrifices, your tithes and special gifts, and all the choice possessions you have vowed to the <span class="name">Lord</span>. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>And there rejoice before the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God&#8212;you, your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, and the Levites from your towns who have no allotment or inheritance of their own. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Be careful not to sacrifice your burnt offerings anywhere you please. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Offer them only at the place the <span class="name">Lord</span> will choose in one of your tribes, and there observe everything I command you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Nevertheless, you may slaughter your animals in any of your towns and eat as much of the meat as you want, as if it were gazelle or deer, according to the blessing the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God gives you.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>But you must not eat the blood; pour it out on the ground like water.
