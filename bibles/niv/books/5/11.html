<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Remember today that your children were not the ones who saw and experienced the discipline of the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God: his majesty, his mighty hand, his outstretched arm; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>the signs he performed and the things he did in the heart of Egypt, both to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his whole country; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>what he did to the Egyptian army, to its horses and chariots, how he overwhelmed them with the waters of the Red Sea
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or the Sea of Reeds">a</a></sup></span>
 as they were pursuing you, and how the <span class="name">Lord</span> brought lasting ruin on them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>It was not your children who saw what he did for you in the wilderness until you arrived at this place, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and what he did to Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab the Reubenite, when the earth opened its mouth right in the middle of all Israel and swallowed them up with their households, their tents and every living thing that belonged to them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But it was your own eyes that saw all these great things the <span class="name">Lord</span> has done.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Observe therefore all the commands I am giving you today, so that you may have the strength to go in and take over the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>and so that you may live long in the land the <span class="name">Lord</span> swore to your ancestors to give to them and their descendants, a land flowing with milk and honey. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>The land you are entering to take over is not like the land of Egypt, from which you have come, where you planted your seed and irrigated it by foot as in a vegetable garden. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But the land you are crossing the Jordan to take possession of is a land of mountains and valleys that drinks rain from heaven. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>It is a land the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God cares for; the eyes of the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God are continually on it from the beginning of the year to its end.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So if you faithfully obey the commands I am giving you today&#8212;to love the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul&#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>then I will send rain on your land in its season, both autumn and spring rains, so that you may gather in your grain, new wine and olive oil. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>I will provide grass in the fields for your cattle, and you will eat and be satisfied.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Be careful, or you will be enticed to turn away and worship other gods and bow down to them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Then the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s anger will burn against you, and he will shut up the heavens so that it will not rain and the ground will yield no produce, and you will soon perish from the good land the <span class="name">Lord</span> is giving you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Fix these words of mine in your hearts and minds; tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Teach them to your children, talking about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>so that your days and the days of your children may be many in the land the <span class="name">Lord</span> swore to give your ancestors, as many as the days that the heavens are above the earth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>If you carefully observe all these commands I am giving you to follow&#8212;to love the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God, to walk in obedience to him and to hold fast to him&#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>then the <span class="name">Lord</span> will drive out all these nations before you, and you will dispossess nations larger and stronger than you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Every place where you set your foot will be yours: Your territory will extend from the desert to Lebanon, and from the Euphrates River to the Mediterranean Sea. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>No one will be able to stand against you. The <span class="name">Lord</span> your God, as he promised you, will put the terror and fear of you on the whole land, wherever you go.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>See, I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse&#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>the blessing if you obey the commands of the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God that I am giving you today;
