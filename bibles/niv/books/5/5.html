<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>These are the commandments the <span class="name">Lord</span> proclaimed in a loud voice to your whole assembly there on the mountain from out of the fire, the cloud and the deep darkness; and he added nothing more.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>But now, why should we die? This great fire will consume us, and we will die if we hear the voice of the <span class="name">Lord</span> our God any longer. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>For what mortal has ever heard the voice of the living God speaking out of fire, as we have, and survived? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Go near and listen to all that the <span class="name">Lord</span> our God says. Then tell us whatever the <span class="name">Lord</span> our God tells you. We will listen and obey.&#8221;</p>
