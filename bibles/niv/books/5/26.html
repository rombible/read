<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>take some of the firstfruits of all that you produce from the soil of the land the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God is giving you and put them in a basket. Then go to the place the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God will choose as a dwelling for his Name 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and say to the priest in office at the time, &#8220;I declare today to the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God that I have come to the land the <span class="name">Lord</span> swore to our ancestors to give us.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>The priest shall take the basket from your hands and set it down in front of the altar of the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Then you shall declare before the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God: &#8220;My father was a wandering Aramean, and he went down into Egypt with a few people and lived there and became a great nation, powerful and numerous. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But the Egyptians mistreated us and made us suffer, subjecting us to harsh labor. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then we cried out to the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the God of our ancestors, and the <span class="name">Lord</span> heard our voice and saw our misery, toil and oppression. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So the <span class="name">Lord</span> brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, with great terror and with signs and wonders. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>He brought us to this place and gave us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey;

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then you and the Levites and the foreigners residing among you shall rejoice in all the good things the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God has given to you and your household.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>When you have finished setting aside a tenth of all your produce in the third year, the year of the tithe, you shall give it to the Levite, the foreigner, the fatherless and the widow, so that they may eat in your towns and be satisfied. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Then say to the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God: &#8220;I have removed from my house the sacred portion and have given it to the Levite, the foreigner, the fatherless and the widow, according to all you commanded. I have not turned aside from your commands nor have I forgotten any of them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>I have not eaten any of the sacred portion while I was in mourning, nor have I removed any of it while I was unclean, nor have I offered any of it to the dead.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Look down from heaven, your holy dwelling place, and bless your people Israel and the land you have given us as you promised on oath to our ancestors, a land flowing with milk and honey.&#8221;</p>
