<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or the Sea of Reeds">a</a></sup></span>
 as the <span class="name">Lord</span> had directed me. For a long time we made our way around the hill country of Seir.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then the <span class="name">Lord</span> said to me, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>&#8220;You have made your way around this hill country long enough; now turn north. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Give the people these orders: &#8216;You are about to pass through the territory of your relatives the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. They will be afraid of you, but be very careful. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Do not provoke them to war, for I will not give you any of their land, not even enough to put your foot on. I have given Esau the hill country of Seir as his own. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>You are to pay them in silver for the food you eat and the water you drink.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands. He has watched over your journey through this vast wilderness. These forty years the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God has been with you, and you have not lacked anything.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>So we went on past our relatives the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. We turned from the Arabah road, which comes up from Elath and Ezion Geber, and traveled along the desert road of Moab.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then the <span class="name">Lord</span> said to me, &#8220;Do not harass the Moabites or provoke them to war, for I will not give you any part of their land. I have given Ar to the descendants of Lot as a possession.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>(The Emites used to live there&#8212;a people strong and numerous, and as tall as the Anakites. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Like the Anakites, they too were considered Rephaites, but the Moabites called them Emites. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Horites used to live in Seir, but the descendants of Esau drove them out.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And the <span class="name">Lord</span> said, &#8220;Now get up and cross the Zered Valley.&#8221; So we crossed the valley.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Thirty-eight years passed from the time we left Kadesh Barnea until we crossed the Zered Valley.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s hand was against them until he had completely eliminated them from the camp.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Now when the last of these fighting men among the people had died, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>the <span class="name">Lord</span> said to me,

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>(That too was considered a land of the Rephaites, who used to live there; but the Ammonites called them Zamzummites.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>This very day I will begin to put the terror and fear of you on all the nations under heaven. They will hear reports of you and will tremble and be in anguish because of you.&#8221;</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>But Sihon king of Heshbon refused to let us pass through.
