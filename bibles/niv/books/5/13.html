<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>and if the sign or wonder spoken of takes place, and the prophet says, &#8220;Let us follow other gods&#8221; (gods you have not known) &#8220;and let us worship them,&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>you must not listen to the words of that prophet or dreamer. The <span class="name">Lord</span> your God is testing you to find out whether you love him with all your heart and with all your soul. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>It is the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God you must follow, and him you must revere. Keep his commands and obey him; serve him and hold fast to him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>That prophet or dreamer must be put to death for inciting rebellion against the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God, who brought you out of Egypt and redeemed you from the land of slavery.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>You must certainly put them to death. Your hand must be the first in putting them to death, and then the hands of all the people.
