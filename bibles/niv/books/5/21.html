<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>your elders and judges shall go out and measure the distance from the body to the neighboring towns. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then the elders of the town nearest the body shall take a heifer that has never been worked and has never worn a yoke 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and lead it down to a valley that has not been plowed or planted and where there is a flowing stream. There in the valley they are to break the heifer&#8217;s neck. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>The Levitical priests shall step forward, for the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God has chosen them to minister and to pronounce blessings in the name of the <span class="name">Lord</span> and to decide all cases of dispute and assault. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then all the elders of the town nearest the body shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley,

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Accept this atonement for your people Israel, whom you have redeemed, <span class="name">Lord</span>, and do not hold your people guilty of the blood of an innocent person.&#8221; Then the bloodshed will be atoned for,

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>and put aside the clothes she was wearing when captured. After she has lived in your house and mourned her father and mother for a full month, then you may go to her and be her husband and she shall be your wife. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>If you are not pleased with her, let her go wherever she wishes. You must not sell her or treat her as a slave, since you have dishonored her.</p>
