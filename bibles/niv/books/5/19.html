<div class="chap"><p class="sectionhead">Cities of Refuge</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>When the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God has destroyed the nations whose land he is giving you, and when you have driven them out and settled in their towns and houses, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>then set aside for yourselves three cities in the land the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God is giving you to possess. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Determine the distances involved and divide into three parts the land the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God is giving you as an inheritance, so that a person who kills someone may flee for refuge to one of these cities.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>This is the rule concerning anyone who kills a person and flees there for safety&#8212;anyone who kills a neighbor unintentionally, without malice aforethought. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>For instance, a man may go into the forest with his neighbor to cut wood, and as he swings his ax to fell a tree, the head may fly off and hit his neighbor and kill him. That man may flee to one of these cities and save his life. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Otherwise, the avenger of blood might pursue him in a rage, overtake him if the distance is too great, and kill him even though he is not deserving of death, since he did it to his neighbor without malice aforethought. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>This is why I command you to set aside for yourselves three cities.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>If the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God enlarges your territory, as he promised on oath to your ancestors, and gives you the whole land he promised them, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>because you carefully follow all these laws I command you today&#8212;to love the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God and to walk always in obedience to him&#8212;then you are to set aside three more cities. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Do this so that innocent blood will not be shed in your land, which the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God is giving you as your inheritance, and so that you will not be guilty of bloodshed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>But if out of hate someone lies in wait, assaults and kills a neighbor, and then flees to one of these cities, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>the killer shall be sent for by the town elders, be brought back from the city, and be handed over to the avenger of blood to die. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Show no pity. You must purge from Israel the guilt of shedding innocent blood, so that it may go well with you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Do not move your neighbor&#8217;s boundary stone set up by your predecessors in the inheritance you receive in the land the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God is giving you to possess.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Witnesses</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>One witness is not enough to convict anyone accused of any crime or offense they may have committed. A matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>If a malicious witness takes the stand to accuse someone of a crime, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>the two people involved in the dispute must stand in the presence of the <span class="name">Lord</span> before the priests and the judges who are in office at the time. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>The judges must make a thorough investigation, and if the witness proves to be a liar, giving false testimony against a fellow Israelite, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>then do to the false witness as that witness intended to do to the other party. You must purge the evil from among you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>The rest of the people will hear of this and be afraid, and never again will such an evil thing be done among you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Show no pity: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
