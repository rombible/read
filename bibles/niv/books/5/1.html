<div class="chap"><p class="sectionhead">The Command to Leave Horeb</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>These are the words Moses spoke to all Israel in the wilderness east of the Jordan&#8212;that is, in the Arabah&#8212;opposite Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth and Dizahab. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>(It takes eleven days to go from Horeb to Kadesh Barnea by the Mount Seir road.)</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses proclaimed to the Israelites all that the <span class="name">Lord</span> had commanded him concerning them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>This was after he had defeated Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, and at Edrei had defeated Og king of Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>East of the Jordan in the territory of Moab, Moses began to expound this law, saying:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> our God said to us at Horeb, &#8220;You have stayed long enough at this mountain. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Break camp and advance into the hill country of the Amorites; go to all the neighboring peoples in the Arabah, in the mountains, in the western foothills, in the Negev and along the coast, to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon, as far as the great river, the Euphrates. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>See, I have given you this land. Go in and take possession of the land the <span class="name">Lord</span> swore he would give to your fathers&#8212;to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob&#8212;and to their descendants after them.&#8221;</p>
<p class="sectionhead">The Appointment of Leaders</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>At that time I said to you, &#8220;You are too heavy a burden for me to carry alone. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> your God has increased your numbers so that today you are as numerous as the stars in the sky. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>May the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the God of your ancestors, increase you a thousand times and bless you as he has promised! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>But how can I bear your problems and your burdens and your disputes all by myself? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Choose some wise, understanding and respected men from each of your tribes, and I will set them over you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>You answered me, &#8220;What you propose to do is good.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So I took the leading men of your tribes, wise and respected men, and appointed them to have authority over you&#8212;as commanders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties and of tens and as tribal officials. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>And I charged your judges at that time, &#8220;Hear the disputes between your people and judge fairly, whether the case is between two Israelites or between an Israelite and a foreigner residing among you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Do not show partiality in judging; hear both small and great alike. Do not be afraid of anyone, for judgment belongs to God. Bring me any case too hard for you, and I will hear it.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>And at that time I told you everything you were to do.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Spies Sent Out</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Then, as the <span class="name">Lord</span> our God commanded us, we set out from Horeb and went toward the hill country of the Amorites through all that vast and dreadful wilderness that you have seen, and so we reached Kadesh Barnea. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Then I said to you, &#8220;You have reached the hill country of the Amorites, which the <span class="name">Lord</span> our God is giving us. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>See, the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God has given you the land. Go up and take possession of it as the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the God of your ancestors, told you. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then all of you came to me and said, &#8220;Let us send men ahead to spy out the land for us and bring back a report about the route we are to take and the towns we will come to.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>The idea seemed good to me; so I selected twelve of you, one man from each tribe. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>They left and went up into the hill country, and came to the Valley of Eshkol and explored it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Taking with them some of the fruit of the land, they brought it down to us and reported, &#8220;It is a good land that the <span class="name">Lord</span> our God is giving us.&#8221;</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Rebellion Against the <span class="name">Lord</span></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>But you were unwilling to go up; you rebelled against the command of the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>You grumbled in your tents and said, &#8220;The <span class="name">Lord</span> hates us; so he brought us out of Egypt to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites to destroy us. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Where can we go? Our brothers have made our hearts melt in fear. They say, &#8216;The people are stronger and taller than we are; the cities are large, with walls up to the sky. We even saw the Anakites there.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Then I said to you, &#8220;Do not be terrified; do not be afraid of them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> your God, who is going before you, will fight for you, as he did for you in Egypt, before your very eyes, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>and in the wilderness. There you saw how the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God carried you, as a father carries his son, all the way you went until you reached this place.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>In spite of this, you did not trust in the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>who went ahead of you on your journey, in fire by night and in a cloud by day, to search out places for you to camp and to show you the way you should go.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>When the <span class="name">Lord</span> heard what you said, he was angry and solemnly swore: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>&#8220;No one from this evil generation shall see the good land I swore to give your ancestors, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-36.htm"><b>36</b></a></span>except Caleb son of Jephunneh. He will see it, and I will give him and his descendants the land he set his feet on, because he followed the <span class="name">Lord</span> wholeheartedly.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-37.htm"><b>37</b></a></span>Because of you the <span class="name">Lord</span> became angry with me also and said, &#8220;You shall not enter it, either. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-38.htm"><b>38</b></a></span>But your assistant, Joshua son of Nun, will enter it. Encourage him, because he will lead Israel to inherit it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-39.htm"><b>39</b></a></span>And the little ones that you said would be taken captive, your children who do not yet know good from bad&#8212;they will enter the land. I will give it to them and they will take possession of it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-40.htm"><b>40</b></a></span>But as for you, turn around and set out toward the desert along the route to the Red Sea.

&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-41.htm"><b>41</b></a></span>Then you replied, &#8220;We have sinned against the <span class="name">Lord</span>. We will go up and fight, as the <span class="name">Lord</span> our God commanded us.&#8221; So every one of you put on his weapons, thinking it easy to go up into the hill country.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-42.htm"><b>42</b></a></span>But the <span class="name">Lord</span> said to me, &#8220;Tell them, &#8216;Do not go up and fight, because I will not be with you.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-43.htm"><b>43</b></a></span>So I told you, but you would not listen. You rebelled against the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s command and in your arrogance you marched up into the hill country.
