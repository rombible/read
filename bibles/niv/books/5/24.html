<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>then her first husband, who divorced her, is not allowed to marry her again after she has been defiled. That would be detestable in the eyes of the <span class="name">Lord</span>. Do not bring sin upon the land the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God is giving you as an inheritance.</p>

 be very careful to do exactly as the Levitical priests instruct you. You must follow carefully what I have commanded them.
