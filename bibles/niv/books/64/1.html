<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/3_john/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Dear friend, I pray that you may enjoy good health and that all may go well with you, even as your soul is getting along well. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/3_john/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>It gave me great joy when some believers came and testified about your faithfulness to the truth, telling how you continue to walk in it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/3_john/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in the truth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/3_john/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Dear friend, you are faithful in what you are doing for the brothers and sisters,

 even though they are strangers to you. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/3_john/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>They have told the church about your love. Please send them on their way in a manner that honors God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/3_john/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>It was for the sake of the Name that they went out, receiving no help from the pagans. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/3_john/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>We ought therefore to show hospitality to such people so that we may work together for the truth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/3_john/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to be first, will not welcome us. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/3_john/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>So when I come, I will call attention to what he is doing, spreading malicious nonsense about us. Not satisfied with that, he even refuses to welcome other believers. He also stops those who want to do so and puts them out of the church.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/3_john/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Dear friend, do not imitate what is evil but what is good. Anyone who does what is good is from God. Anyone who does what is evil has not seen God.
