<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Now Ahaziah had fallen through the lattice of his upper room in Samaria and injured himself. So he sent messengers, saying to them, &#8220;Go and consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron, to see if I will recover from this injury.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>But the angel of the <span class="name">Lord</span> said to Elijah the Tishbite, &#8220;Go up and meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and ask them, &#8216;Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going off to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron?&#8217; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Therefore this is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> says: &#8216;You will not leave the bed you are lying on. You will certainly die!&#8217;&#8239;&#8221; So Elijah went.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>When the messengers returned to the king, he asked them, &#8220;Why have you come back?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>&#8220;A man came to meet us,&#8221; they replied. &#8220;And he said to us, &#8216;Go back to the king who sent you and tell him, &#8220;This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> says: Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending messengers to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you will not leave the bed you are lying on. You will certainly die!&#8221;&#8239;&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>The king asked them, &#8220;What kind of man was it who came to meet you and told you this?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>They replied, &#8220;He had a garment of hair
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or He was a hairy man">a</a></sup></span>
 and had a leather belt around his waist.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">The king said, &#8220;That was Elijah the Tishbite.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then he sent to Elijah a captain with his company of fifty men. The captain went up to Elijah, who was sitting on the top of a hill, and said to him, &#8220;Man of God, the king says, &#8216;Come down!&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Elijah answered the captain, &#8220;If I am a man of God, may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men!&#8221; Then fire fell from heaven and consumed the captain and his men.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>At this the king sent to Elijah another captain with his fifty men. The captain said to him, &#8220;Man of God, this is what the king says, &#8216;Come down at once!&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>&#8220;If I am a man of God,&#8221; Elijah replied, &#8220;may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men!&#8221; Then the fire of God fell from heaven and consumed him and his fifty men.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>So the king sent a third captain with his fifty men. This third captain went up and fell on his knees before Elijah. &#8220;Man of God,&#8221; he begged, &#8220;please have respect for my life and the lives of these fifty men, your servants! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>See, fire has fallen from heaven and consumed the first two captains and all their men. But now have respect for my life!&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>The angel of the <span class="name">Lord</span> said to Elijah, &#8220;Go down with him; do not be afraid of him.&#8221; So Elijah got up and went down with him to the king.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>He told the king, &#8220;This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> says: Is it because there is no God in Israel for you to consult that you have sent messengers to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron? Because you have done this, you will never leave the bed you are lying on. You will certainly die!&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So he died, according to the word of the <span class="name">Lord</span> that Elijah had spoken.</p><p class="reg">Because Ahaziah had no son, Joram
