He burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron Valley and took the ashes to Bethel. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>He did away with the idolatrous priests appointed by the kings of Judah to burn incense on the high places of the towns of Judah and on those around Jerusalem&#8212;those who burned incense to Baal, to the sun and moon, to the constellations and to all the starry hosts. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>He took the Asherah pole from the temple of the <span class="name">Lord</span> to the Kidron Valley outside Jerusalem and burned it there.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>He also tore down the quarters of the male shrine prostitutes that were in the temple of the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the quarters where women did weaving for Asherah.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>He pulled down the altars the kings of Judah had erected on the roof near the upper room of Ahaz, and the altars Manasseh had built in the two courts of the temple of the <span class="name">Lord</span>. He removed them from there, smashed them to pieces and threw the rubble into the Kidron Valley. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>The king also desecrated the high places that were east of Jerusalem on the south of the Hill of Corruption&#8212;the ones Solomon king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the vile goddess of the Sidonians, for Chemosh the vile god of Moab, and for Molek the detestable god of the people of Ammon. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Josiah smashed the sacred stones and cut down the Asherah poles and covered the sites with human bones.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Even the altar at Bethel, the high place made by Jeroboam son of Nebat, who had caused Israel to sin&#8212;even that altar and high place he demolished. He burned the high place and ground it to powder, and burned the Asherah pole also. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then Josiah looked around, and when he saw the tombs that were there on the hillside, he had the bones removed from them and burned on the altar to defile it, in accordance with the word of the <span class="name">Lord</span> proclaimed by the man of God who foretold these things.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>The king asked, &#8220;What is that tombstone I see?&#8221;</p><p class="reg">The people of the city said, &#8220;It marks the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and pronounced against the altar of Bethel the very things you have done to it.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>&#8220;Leave it alone,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let anyone disturb his bones.&#8221; So they spared his bones and those of the prophet who had come from Samaria.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Just as he had done at Bethel, Josiah removed all the shrines at the high places that the kings of Israel had built in the towns of Samaria and that had aroused the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s anger. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Josiah slaughtered all the priests of those high places on the altars and burned human bones on them. Then he went back to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>The king gave this order to all the people: &#8220;Celebrate the Passover to the <span class="name">Lord</span> your God, as it is written in this Book of the Covenant.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Neither in the days of the judges who led Israel nor in the days of the kings of Israel and the kings of Judah had any such Passover been observed. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>But in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, this Passover was celebrated to the <span class="name">Lord</span> in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Furthermore, Josiah got rid of the mediums and spiritists, the household gods, the idols and all the other detestable things seen in Judah and Jerusalem. This he did to fulfill the requirements of the law written in the book that Hilkiah the priest had discovered in the temple of the <span class="name">Lord</span>. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Neither before nor after Josiah was there a king like him who turned to the <span class="name">Lord</span> as he did&#8212;with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his strength, in accordance with all the Law of Moses.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>Nevertheless, the <span class="name">Lord</span> did not turn away from the heat of his fierce anger, which burned against Judah because of all that Manasseh had done to arouse his anger. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>So the <span class="name">Lord</span> said, &#8220;I will remove Judah also from my presence as I removed Israel, and I will reject Jerusalem, the city I chose, and this temple, about which I said, &#8216;My Name shall be there.&#8217;
