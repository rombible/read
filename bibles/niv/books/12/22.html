His mother&#8217;s name was Jedidah daughter of Adaiah; she was from Bozkath. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>He did what was right in the eyes of the <span class="name">Lord</span> and followed completely the ways of his father David, not turning aside to the right or to the left.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>In the eighteenth year of his reign, King Josiah sent the secretary, Shaphan son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, to the temple of the <span class="name">Lord</span>. He said: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8220;Go up to Hilkiah the high priest and have him get ready the money that has been brought into the temple of the <span class="name">Lord</span>, which the doorkeepers have collected from the people. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>Have them entrust it to the men appointed to supervise the work on the temple. And have these men pay the workers who repair the temple of the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>the carpenters, the builders and the masons. Also have them purchase timber and dressed stone to repair the temple. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But they need not account for the money entrusted to them, because they are honest in their dealings.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the secretary, &#8220;I have found the Book of the Law in the temple of the <span class="name">Lord</span>.&#8221; He gave it to Shaphan, who read it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then Shaphan the secretary went to the king and reported to him: &#8220;Your officials have paid out the money that was in the temple of the <span class="name">Lord</span> and have entrusted it to the workers and supervisors at the temple.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Then Shaphan the secretary informed the king, &#8220;Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.&#8221; And Shaphan read from it in the presence of the king.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>When the king heard the words of the Book of the Law, he tore his robes. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>He gave these orders to Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Akbor son of Micaiah, Shaphan the secretary and Asaiah the king&#8217;s attendant: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>&#8220;Go and inquire of the <span class="name">Lord</span> for me and for the people and for all Judah about what is written in this book that has been found. Great is the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s anger that burns against us because those who have gone before us have not obeyed the words of this book; they have not acted in accordance with all that is written there concerning us.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Akbor, Shaphan and Asaiah went to speak to the prophet Huldah, who was the wife of Shallum son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe. She lived in Jerusalem, in the New Quarter.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>She said to them, &#8220;This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, says: Tell the man who sent you to me,

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>Because they have forsaken me and burned incense to other gods and aroused my anger by all the idols their hands have made,

 my anger will burn against this place and will not be quenched.&#8217;
