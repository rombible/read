<div class="chap"><p class="sectionhead">Manasseh King of Judah</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-five years. His mother&#8217;s name was Hephzibah. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>He did evil in the eyes of the <span class="name">Lord</span>, following the detestable practices of the nations the <span class="name">Lord</span> had driven out before the Israelites. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>He rebuilt the high places his father Hezekiah had destroyed; he also erected altars to Baal and made an Asherah pole, as Ahab king of Israel had done. He bowed down to all the starry hosts and worshiped them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>He built altars in the temple of the <span class="name">Lord</span>, of which the <span class="name">Lord</span> had said, &#8220;In Jerusalem I will put my Name.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>In the two courts of the temple of the <span class="name">Lord</span>, he built altars to all the starry hosts. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>He sacrificed his own son in the fire, practiced divination, sought omens, and consulted mediums and spiritists. He did much evil in the eyes of the <span class="name">Lord</span>, arousing his anger.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>He took the carved Asherah pole he had made and put it in the temple, of which the <span class="name">Lord</span> had said to David and to his son Solomon, &#8220;In this temple and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my Name forever. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>I will not again make the feet of the Israelites wander from the land I gave their ancestors, if only they will be careful to do everything I commanded them and will keep the whole Law that my servant Moses gave them.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But the people did not listen. Manasseh led them astray, so that they did more evil than the nations the <span class="name">Lord</span> had destroyed before the Israelites.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> said through his servants the prophets: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8220;Manasseh king of Judah has committed these detestable sins. He has done more evil than the Amorites who preceded him and has led Judah into sin with his idols. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Therefore this is what the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, says: I am going to bring such disaster on Jerusalem and Judah that the ears of everyone who hears of it will tingle. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>I will stretch out over Jerusalem the measuring line used against Samaria and the plumb line used against the house of Ahab. I will wipe out Jerusalem as one wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>I will forsake the remnant of my inheritance and give them into the hands of enemies. They will be looted and plundered by all their enemies; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>they have done evil in my eyes and have aroused my anger from the day their ancestors came out of Egypt until this day.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Moreover, Manasseh also shed so much innocent blood that he filled Jerusalem from end to end&#8212;besides the sin that he had caused Judah to commit, so that they did evil in the eyes of the <span class="name">Lord</span>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>As for the other events of Manasseh&#8217;s reign, and all he did, including the sin he committed, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Manasseh rested with his ancestors and was buried in his palace garden, the garden of Uzza. And Amon his son succeeded him as king.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Amon King of Judah</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem two years. His mother&#8217;s name was Meshullemeth daughter of Haruz; she was from Jotbah. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>He did evil in the eyes of the <span class="name">Lord</span>, as his father Manasseh had done. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>He followed completely the ways of his father, worshiping the idols his father had worshiped, and bowing down to them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>He forsook the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the God of his ancestors, and did not walk in obedience to him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Amon&#8217;s officials conspired against him and assassinated the king in his palace. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then the people of the land killed all who had plotted against King Amon, and they made Josiah his son king in his place.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>As for the other events of Amon&#8217;s reign, and what he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
