So Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria: to the officials of Jezreel,
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew; some Septuagint manuscripts and Vulgate of the city">a</a></sup></span>
 to the elders and to the guardians of Ahab&#8217;s children. He said, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>&#8220;You have your master&#8217;s sons with you and you have chariots and horses, a fortified city and weapons. Now as soon as this letter reaches you, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>choose the best and most worthy of your master&#8217;s sons and set him on his father&#8217;s throne. Then fight for your master&#8217;s house.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But they were terrified and said, &#8220;If two kings could not resist him, how can we?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>So the palace administrator, the city governor, the elders and the guardians sent this message to Jehu: &#8220;We are your servants and we will do anything you say. We will not appoint anyone as king; you do whatever you think best.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then Jehu wrote them a second letter, saying, &#8220;If you are on my side and will obey me, take the heads of your master&#8217;s sons and come to me in Jezreel by this time tomorrow.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">Now the royal princes, seventy of them, were with the leading men of the city, who were rearing them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>When the letter arrived, these men took the princes and slaughtered all seventy of them. They put their heads in baskets and sent them to Jehu in Jezreel. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>When the messenger arrived, he told Jehu, &#8220;They have brought the heads of the princes.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">Then Jehu ordered, &#8220;Put them in two piles at the entrance of the city gate until morning.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>The next morning Jehu went out. He stood before all the people and said, &#8220;You are innocent. It was I who conspired against my master and killed him, but who killed all these? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>Know, then, that not a word the <span class="name">Lord</span> has spoken against the house of Ahab will fail. The <span class="name">Lord</span> has done what he announced through his servant Elijah.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>So Jehu killed everyone in Jezreel who remained of the house of Ahab, as well as all his chief men, his close friends and his priests, leaving him no survivor.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Jehu then set out and went toward Samaria. At Beth Eked of the Shepherds, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>he met some relatives of Ahaziah king of Judah and asked, &#8220;Who are you?&#8221;</p><p class="reg">They said, &#8220;We are relatives of Ahaziah, and we have come down to greet the families of the king and of the queen mother.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>&#8220;Take them alive!&#8221; he ordered. So they took them alive and slaughtered them by the well of Beth Eked&#8212;forty-two of them. He left no survivor.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>After he left there, he came upon Jehonadab son of Rekab, who was on his way to meet him. Jehu greeted him and said, &#8220;Are you in accord with me, as I am with you?&#8221;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;I am,&#8221; Jehonadab answered.</p><p class="reg">&#8220;If so,&#8221; said Jehu, &#8220;give me your hand.&#8221; So he did, and Jehu helped him up into the chariot. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Jehu said, &#8220;Come with me and see my zeal for the <span class="name">Lord</span>.&#8221; Then he had him ride along in his chariot.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>When Jehu came to Samaria, he killed all who were left there of Ahab&#8217;s family; he destroyed them, according to the word of the <span class="name">Lord</span> spoken to Elijah.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Servants of Baal Killed</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then Jehu brought all the people together and said to them, &#8220;Ahab served Baal a little; Jehu will serve him much. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Now summon all the prophets of Baal, all his servants and all his priests. See that no one is missing, because I am going to hold a great sacrifice for Baal. Anyone who fails to come will no longer live.&#8221; But Jehu was acting deceptively in order to destroy the servants of Baal.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Jehu said, &#8220;Call an assembly in honor of Baal.&#8221; So they proclaimed it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then he sent word throughout Israel, and all the servants of Baal came; not one stayed away. They crowded into the temple of Baal until it was full from one end to the other. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And Jehu said to the keeper of the wardrobe, &#8220;Bring robes for all the servants of Baal.&#8221; So he brought out robes for them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Then Jehu and Jehonadab son of Rekab went into the temple of Baal. Jehu said to the servants of Baal, &#8220;Look around and see that no one who serves the <span class="name">Lord</span> is here with you&#8212;only servants of Baal.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>So they went in to make sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had posted eighty men outside with this warning: &#8220;If one of you lets any of the men I am placing in your hands escape, it will be your life for his life.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>As soon as Jehu had finished making the burnt offering, he ordered the guards and officers: &#8220;Go in and kill them; let no one escape.&#8221; So they cut them down with the sword. The guards and officers threw the bodies out and then entered the inner shrine of the temple of Baal. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>They brought the sacred stone out of the temple of Baal and burned it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>They demolished the sacred stone of Baal and tore down the temple of Baal, and people have used it for a latrine to this day.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>So Jehu destroyed Baal worship in Israel. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>However, he did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit&#8212;the worship of the golden calves at Bethel and Dan.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> said to Jehu, &#8220;Because you have done well in accomplishing what is right in my eyes and have done to the house of Ahab all I had in mind to do, your descendants will sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>Yet Jehu was not careful to keep the law of the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, with all his heart. He did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam, which he had caused Israel to commit.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>In those days the <span class="name">Lord</span> began to reduce the size of Israel. Hazael overpowered the Israelites throughout their territory 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>east of the Jordan in all the land of Gilead (the region of Gad, Reuben and Manasseh), from Aroer by the Arnon Gorge through Gilead to Bashan.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>As for the other events of Jehu&#8217;s reign, all he did, and all his achievements, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-35.htm"><b>35</b></a></span>Jehu rested with his ancestors and was buried in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son succeeded him as king.
