<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>When you get there, look for Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi. Go to him, get him away from his companions and take him into an inner room. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Then take the flask and pour the oil on his head and declare, &#8216;This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> says: I anoint you king over Israel.&#8217; Then open the door and run; don&#8217;t delay!&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>So the young prophet went to Ramoth Gilead. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>When he arrived, he found the army officers sitting together. &#8220;I have a message for you, commander,&#8221; he said.</p><p class="reg">&#8220;For which of us?&#8221; asked Jehu.</p><p class="reg">&#8220;For you, commander,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Jehu got up and went into the house. Then the prophet poured the oil on Jehu&#8217;s head and declared, &#8220;This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, says: &#8216;I anoint you king over the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s people Israel. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>You are to destroy the house of Ahab your master, and I will avenge the blood of my servants the prophets and the blood of all the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s servants shed by Jezebel. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>The whole house of Ahab will perish. I will cut off from Ahab every last male in Israel&#8212;slave or free.
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or Israel--every ruler or leader">a</a></sup></span>
 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat and like the house of Baasha son of Ahijah. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>As for Jezebel, dogs will devour her on the plot of ground at Jezreel, and no one will bury her.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221; Then he opened the door and ran.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>When Jehu went out to his fellow officers, one of them asked him, &#8220;Is everything all right? Why did this maniac come to you?&#8221;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;You know the man and the sort of things he says,&#8221; Jehu replied.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>&#8220;That&#8217;s not true!&#8221; they said. &#8220;Tell us.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">Jehu said, &#8220;Here is what he told me: &#8216;This is what the <span class="name">Lord</span> says: I anoint you king over Israel.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>They quickly took their cloaks and spread them under him on the bare steps. Then they blew the trumpet and shouted, &#8220;Jehu is king!&#8221;</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Jehu Kills Joram and Ahaziah</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>So Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, conspired against Joram. (Now Joram and all Israel had been defending Ramoth Gilead against Hazael king of Aram, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>but King Joram
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Hebrew Jehoram, a variant of Joram; also in verses 17 and 21-24">b</a></sup></span>
 had returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds the Arameans had inflicted on him in the battle with Hazael king of Aram.) Jehu said, &#8220;If you desire to make me king, don&#8217;t let anyone slip out of the city to go and tell the news in Jezreel.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then he got into his chariot and rode to Jezreel, because Joram was resting there and Ahaziah king of Judah had gone down to see him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>When the lookout standing on the tower in Jezreel saw Jehu&#8217;s troops approaching, he called out, &#8220;I see some troops coming.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;Get a horseman,&#8221; Joram ordered. &#8220;Send him to meet them and ask, &#8216;Do you come in peace?&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>The horseman rode off to meet Jehu and said, &#8220;This is what the king says: &#8216;Do you come in peace?&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;What do you have to do with peace?&#8221; Jehu replied. &#8220;Fall in behind me.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">The lookout reported, &#8220;The messenger has reached them, but he isn&#8217;t coming back.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>So the king sent out a second horseman. When he came to them he said, &#8220;This is what the king says: &#8216;Do you come in peace?&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p><p class="reg">Jehu replied, &#8220;What do you have to do with peace? Fall in behind me.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>The lookout reported, &#8220;He has reached them, but he isn&#8217;t coming back either. The driving is like that of Jehu son of Nimshi&#8212;he drives like a maniac.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>&#8220;Hitch up my chariot,&#8221; Joram ordered. And when it was hitched up, Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah rode out, each in his own chariot, to meet Jehu. They met him at the plot of ground that had belonged to Naboth the Jezreelite. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>When Joram saw Jehu he asked, &#8220;Have you come in peace, Jehu?&#8221;</p><p class="reg">&#8220;How can there be peace,&#8221; Jehu replied, &#8220;as long as all the idolatry and witchcraft of your mother Jezebel abound?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>Joram turned about and fled, calling out to Ahaziah, &#8220;Treachery, Ahaziah!&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then Jehu drew his bow and shot Joram between the shoulders. The arrow pierced his heart and he slumped down in his chariot. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Jehu said to Bidkar, his chariot officer, &#8220;Pick him up and throw him on the field that belonged to Naboth the Jezreelite. Remember how you and I were riding together in chariots behind Ahab his father when the <span class="name">Lord</span> spoke this prophecy against him: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>&#8216;Yesterday I saw the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons, declares the <span class="name">Lord</span>, and I will surely make you pay for it on this plot of ground, declares the <span class="name">Lord</span>.&#8217;
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="See 1 Kings 21:19.">c</a></sup></span>
 Now then, pick him up and throw him on that plot, in accordance with the word of the <span class="name">Lord</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>When Ahaziah king of Judah saw what had happened, he fled up the road to Beth Haggan.
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or fled by way of the garden house">d</a></sup></span>
 Jehu chased him, shouting, &#8220;Kill him too!&#8221; They wounded him in his chariot on the way up to Gur near Ibleam, but he escaped to Megiddo and died there. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>His servants took him by chariot to Jerusalem and buried him with his ancestors in his tomb in the City of David.

<p class="sectionhead">Jezebel Killed</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>Then Jehu went to Jezreel. When Jezebel heard about it, she put on eye makeup, arranged her hair and looked out of a window. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>As Jehu entered the gate, she asked, &#8220;Have you come in peace, you Zimri, you murderer of your master?&#8221;

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-33.htm"><b>33</b></a></span>&#8220;Throw her down!&#8221; Jehu said. So they threw her down, and some of her blood spattered the wall and the horses as they trampled her underfoot.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-34.htm"><b>34</b></a></span>Jehu went in and ate and drank. &#8220;Take care of that cursed woman,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and bury her, for she was a king&#8217;s daughter.&#8221;
