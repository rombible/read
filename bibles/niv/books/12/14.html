 son of Jehoahaz king of Israel, Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah began to reign. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother&#8217;s name was Jehoaddan; she was from Jerusalem. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>He did what was right in the eyes of the <span class="name">Lord</span>, but not as his father David had done. In everything he followed the example of his father Joash. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>The high places, however, were not removed; the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, with the challenge: &#8220;Come, let us face each other in battle.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>But Jehoash king of Israel replied to Amaziah king of Judah: &#8220;A thistle in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar in Lebanon, &#8216;Give your daughter to my son in marriage.&#8217; Then a wild beast in Lebanon came along and trampled the thistle underfoot.
