<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then the city wall was broken through, and the whole army fled at night through the gate between the two walls near the king&#8217;s garden, though the Babylonians

 army pursued the king and overtook him in the plains of Jericho. All his soldiers were separated from him and scattered,
