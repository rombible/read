<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>He did evil in the eyes of the <span class="name">Lord</span> by following the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit, and he did not turn away from them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s anger burned against Israel, and for a long time he kept them under the power of Hazael king of Aram and Ben-Hadad his son.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Then Jehoahaz sought the <span class="name">Lord</span>&#8217;s favor, and the <span class="name">Lord</span> listened to him, for he saw how severely the king of Aram was oppressing Israel. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>The <span class="name">Lord</span> provided a deliverer for Israel, and they escaped from the power of Aram. So the Israelites lived in their own homes as they had before. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>But they did not turn away from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, which he had caused Israel to commit; they continued in them. Also, the Asherah pole

 remained standing in Samaria.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Nothing had been left of the army of Jehoahaz except fifty horsemen, ten chariots and ten thousand foot soldiers, for the king of Aram had destroyed the rest and made them like the dust at threshing time.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>As for the other events of the reign of Jehoahaz, all he did and his achievements, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Jehoahaz rested with his ancestors and was buried in Samaria. And Jehoash

 his son succeeded him as king.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Jehoash King of Israel</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>In the thirty-seventh year of Joash king of Judah, Jehoash son of Jehoahaz became king of Israel in Samaria, and he reigned sixteen years. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>He did evil in the eyes of the <span class="name">Lord</span> and did not turn away from any of the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit; he continued in them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>As for the other events of the reign of Jehoash, all he did and his achievements, including his war against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>Jehoash rested with his ancestors, and Jeroboam succeeded him on the throne. Jehoash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>Now Elisha had been suffering from the illness from which he died.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>Elisha said, &#8220;Get a bow and some arrows,&#8221; and he did so. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>&#8220;Take the bow in your hands,&#8221; he said to the king of Israel. When he had taken it, Elisha put his hands on the king&#8217;s hands.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then he said, &#8220;Take the arrows,&#8221; and the king took them. Elisha told him, &#8220;Strike the ground.&#8221; He struck it three times and stopped. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>The man of God was angry with him and said, &#8220;You should have struck the ground five or six times; then you would have defeated Aram and completely destroyed it.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Elisha died and was buried.</p><p class="reg">Now Moabite raiders used to enter the country every spring.
