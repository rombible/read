<p class="sectionhead">The Return to Jerusalem</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/8-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>I assembled them at the canal that flows toward Ahava, and we camped there three days. When I checked among the people and the priests, I found no Levites there. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/8-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So I summoned Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah and Meshullam, who were leaders, and Joiarib and Elnathan, who were men of learning, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/8-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>and I ordered them to go to Iddo, the leader in Kasiphia. I told them what to say to Iddo and his fellow Levites, the temple servants in Kasiphia, so that they might bring attendants to us for the house of our God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/8-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Because the gracious hand of our God was on us, they brought us Sherebiah, a capable man, from the descendants of Mahli son of Levi, the son of Israel, and Sherebiah&#8217;s sons and brothers, 18 in all; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/8-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>and Hashabiah, together with Jeshaiah from the descendants of Merari, and his brothers and nephews, 20 in all. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/8-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>They also brought 220 of the temple servants&#8212;a body that David and the officials had established to assist the Levites. All were registered by name.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/8-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>There, by the Ahava Canal, I proclaimed a fast, so that we might humble ourselves before our God and ask him for a safe journey for us and our children, with all our possessions. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/8-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>I was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers and horsemen to protect us from enemies on the road, because we had told the king, &#8220;The gracious hand of our God is on everyone who looks to him, but his great anger is against all who forsake him.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/8-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>So we fasted and petitioned our God about this, and he answered our prayer.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/8-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests, namely, Sherebiah, Hashabiah and ten of their brothers, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/8-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>and I weighed out to them the offering of silver and gold and the articles that the king, his advisers, his officials and all Israel present there had donated for the house of our God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/8-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>I weighed out to them 650 talents

 100 talents

 and two fine articles of polished bronze, as precious as gold.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/8-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>I said to them, &#8220;You as well as these articles are consecrated to the <span class="name">Lord</span>.
