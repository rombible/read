 among them complained against the Hebraic Jews because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution of food. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/6-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So the Twelve gathered all the disciples together and said, &#8220;It would not be right for us to neglect the ministry of the word of God in order to wait on tables. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/6-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Brothers and sisters, choose seven men from among you who are known to be full of the Spirit and wisdom. We will turn this responsibility over to them 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/6-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>and will give our attention to prayer and the ministry of the word.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/6-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>This proposal pleased the whole group. They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit; also Philip, Procorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas from Antioch, a convert to Judaism. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/6-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>They presented these men to the apostles, who prayed and laid their hands on them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/6-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>So the word of God spread. The number of disciples in Jerusalem increased rapidly, and a large number of priests became obedient to the faith.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">Stephen Seized</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/6-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Now Stephen, a man full of God&#8217;s grace and power, performed great wonders and signs among the people. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/6-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Opposition arose, however, from members of the Synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called)&#8212;Jews of Cyrene and Alexandria as well as the provinces of Cilicia and Asia&#8212;who began to argue with Stephen. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/6-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>But they could not stand up against the wisdom the Spirit gave him as he spoke.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/6-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Then they secretly persuaded some men to say, &#8220;We have heard Stephen speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/6-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>So they stirred up the people and the elders and the teachers of the law. They seized Stephen and brought him before the Sanhedrin. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/6-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>They produced false witnesses, who testified, &#8220;This fellow never stops speaking against this holy place and against the law. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/6-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs Moses handed down to us.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/6-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>All who were sitting in the Sanhedrin looked intently at Stephen, and they saw that his face was like the face of an angel.</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><A name="footnotes"></a><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotebot">That is, Jews who had adopted the Greek language and culture</span><br><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
