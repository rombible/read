<div class="chap"><p class="sectionhead">Peter and John Before the Sanhedrin</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/4-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>The priests and the captain of the temple guard and the Sadducees came up to Peter and John while they were speaking to the people. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/4-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>They were greatly disturbed because the apostles were teaching the people, proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection of the dead. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/4-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>They seized Peter and John and, because it was evening, they put them in jail until the next day. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/4-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But many who heard the message believed; so the number of men who believed grew to about five thousand.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/4-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>The next day the rulers, the elders and the teachers of the law met in Jerusalem. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/4-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Annas the high priest was there, and so were Caiaphas, John, Alexander and others of the high priest&#8217;s family. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/4-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>They had Peter and John brought before them and began to question them: &#8220;By what power or what name did you do this?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/4-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them: &#8220;Rulers and elders of the people! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/4-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>If we are being called to account today for an act of kindness shown to a man who was lame and are being asked how he was healed, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/4-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>then know this, you and all the people of Israel: It is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified but whom God raised from the dead, that this man stands before you healed. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/4-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Jesus is</p><div class="stanza"><p class="line1">&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;the stone you builders rejected,</p><p class="line2">which has become the cornerstone.&#8217;

</p></div>
<p class="pcontinued"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/4-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/4-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>When they saw the courage of Peter and John and realized that they were unschooled, ordinary men, they were astonished and they took note that these men had been with Jesus. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/4-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>But since they could see the man who had been healed standing there with them, there was nothing they could say. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/4-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>So they ordered them to withdraw from the Sanhedrin and then conferred together. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/4-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>&#8220;What are we going to do with these men?&#8221; they asked. &#8220;Everyone living in Jerusalem knows they have performed a notable sign, and we cannot deny it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/4-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>But to stop this thing from spreading any further among the people, we must warn them to speak no longer to anyone in this name.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/4-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Then they called them in again and commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/4-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>But Peter and John replied, &#8220;Which is right in God&#8217;s eyes: to listen to you, or to him? You be the judges! 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/4-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>As for us, we cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/4-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>After further threats they let them go. They could not decide how to punish them, because all the people were praising God for what had happened. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/4-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>For the man who was miraculously healed was over forty years old.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">The Believers Pray</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/4-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>On their release, Peter and John went back to their own people and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/4-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>When they heard this, they raised their voices together in prayer to God. &#8220;Sovereign Lord,&#8221; they said, &#8220;you made the heavens and the earth and the sea, and everything in them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/4-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>You spoke by the Holy Spirit through the mouth of your servant, our father David:</p><div class="stanza"><p class="line1">&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;Why do the nations rage</p><p class="line2">and the peoples plot in vain?</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/4-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>Now, Lord, consider their threats and enable your servants to speak your word with great boldness.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/4-31.htm"><b>31</b></a></span>After they prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God boldly.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">The Believers Share Their Possessions</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/4-32.htm"><b>32</b></a></span>All the believers were one in heart and mind.
