<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>After his suffering, he presented himself to them and gave many convincing proofs that he was alive. He appeared to them over a period of forty days and spoke about the kingdom of God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>On one occasion, while he was eating with them, he gave them this command: <span class="red">&#8220;Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my Father promised, which you have heard me speak about.</span>

 the Holy Spirit.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>Then they gathered around him and asked him, &#8220;Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>He said to them: <span class="red">&#8220;It is not for you to know the times or dates the Father has set by his own authority.</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span><span class="red">But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>After he said this, he was taken up before their very eyes, and a cloud hid him from their sight.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>They were looking intently up into the sky as he was going, when suddenly two men dressed in white stood beside them. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8220;Men of Galilee,&#8221; they said, &#8220;why do you stand here looking into the sky?

<p class="sectionhead">Matthias Chosen to Replace Judas</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>Then the apostles returned to Jerusalem from the hill called the Mount of Olives, a Sabbath day&#8217;s walk

 from the city. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>When they arrived, they went upstairs to the room where they were staying.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>They all joined together constantly in prayer, along with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>In those days Peter stood up among the believers (a group numbering about a hundred and twenty)

 the Scripture had to be fulfilled in which the Holy Spirit spoke long ago through David concerning Judas, who served as guide for those who arrested Jesus. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>He was one of our number and shared in our ministry.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>(With the payment he received for his wickedness, Judas bought a field; there he fell headlong, his body burst open and all his intestines spilled out.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>&#8220;For,&#8221; said Peter, &#8220;it is written in the Book of Psalms:</p><div class="stanza"><p class="line1">&#8220;&#8239;&#8216;May his place be deserted;</p><p class="line2">let there be no one to dwell in it,&#8217;
