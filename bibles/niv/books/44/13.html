<div class="chap"><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>Now in the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen (who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch) and Saul. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, &#8220;Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>So after they had fasted and prayed, they placed their hands on them and sent them off.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">On Cyprus</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>The two of them, sent on their way by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia and sailed from there to Cyprus. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>When they arrived at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish synagogues. John was with them as their helper.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>They traveled through the whole island until they came to Paphos. There they met a Jewish sorcerer and false prophet named Bar-Jesus, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>who was an attendant of the proconsul, Sergius Paulus. The proconsul, an intelligent man, sent for Barnabas and Saul because he wanted to hear the word of God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But Elymas the sorcerer (for that is what his name means) opposed them and tried to turn the proconsul from the faith. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>Then Saul, who was also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked straight at Elymas and said, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>&#8220;You are a child of the devil and an enemy of everything that is right! You are full of all kinds of deceit and trickery. Will you never stop perverting the right ways of the Lord? 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>Now the hand of the Lord is against you. You are going to be blind for a time, not even able to see the light of the sun.&#8221;</p><p class="reg">Immediately mist and darkness came over him, and he groped about, seeking someone to lead him by the hand. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>When the proconsul saw what had happened, he believed, for he was amazed at the teaching about the Lord.</p>
<p class="sectionhead">In Pisidian Antioch</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>From Paphos, Paul and his companions sailed to Perga in Pamphylia, where John left them to return to Jerusalem. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>From Perga they went on to Pisidian Antioch. On the Sabbath they entered the synagogue and sat down. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>After the reading from the Law and the Prophets, the leaders of the synagogue sent word to them, saying, &#8220;Brothers, if you have a word of exhortation for the people, please speak.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Standing up, Paul motioned with his hand and said: &#8220;Fellow Israelites and you Gentiles who worship God, listen to me!

 in the wilderness;

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>All this took about 450 years.</p><p class="reg">&#8220;After this, God gave them judges until the time of Samuel the prophet. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>Then the people asked for a king, and he gave them Saul son of Kish, of the tribe of Benjamin, who ruled forty years.

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>As John was completing his work, he said: &#8216;Who do you suppose I am? I am not the one you are looking for. But there is one coming after me whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.&#8217;</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>The people of Jerusalem and their rulers did not recognize Jesus, yet in condemning him they fulfilled the words of the prophets that are read every Sabbath. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>Though they found no proper ground for a death sentence, they asked Pilate to have him executed.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-44.htm"><b>44</b></a></span>On the next Sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord.
