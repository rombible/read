<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>When Paul was called in, Tertullus presented his case before Felix: &#8220;We have enjoyed a long period of peace under you, and your foresight has brought about reforms in this nation. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>Everywhere and in every way, most excellent Felix, we acknowledge this with profound gratitude. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>But in order not to weary you further, I would request that you be kind enough to hear us briefly.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8220;We have found this man to be a troublemaker, stirring up riots among the Jews all over the world. He is a ringleader of the Nazarene sect 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>and even tried to desecrate the temple; so we seized him. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-7.htm"><b>[7]</b></a></span>
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Some manuscripts include here him, and we would have judged him in accordance with our law. But the commander Lysias came and took him from us with much violence, 8 ordering his accusers to come before you.">a</a></sup></span>

<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>By examining him yourself you will be able to learn the truth about all these charges we are bringing against him.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>The other Jews joined in the accusation, asserting that these things were true.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>When the governor motioned for him to speak, Paul replied: &#8220;I know that for a number of years you have been a judge over this nation; so I gladly make my defense. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>You can easily verify that no more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>My accusers did not find me arguing with anyone at the temple, or stirring up a crowd in the synagogues or anywhere else in the city. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>And they cannot prove to you the charges they are now making against me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>However, I admit that I worship the God of our ancestors as a follower of the Way, which they call a sect. I believe everything that is in accordance with the Law and that is written in the Prophets, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>and I have the same hope in God as these men themselves have, that there will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>So I strive always to keep my conscience clear before God and man.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>&#8220;After an absence of several years, I came to Jerusalem to bring my people gifts for the poor and to present offerings. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>I was ceremonially clean when they found me in the temple courts doing this. There was no crowd with me, nor was I involved in any disturbance. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>But there are some Jews from the province of Asia, who ought to be here before you and bring charges if they have anything against me. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Or these who are here should state what crime they found in me when I stood before the Sanhedrin&#8212; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>unless it was this one thing I shouted as I stood in their presence: &#8216;It is concerning the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you today.&#8217;&#8239;&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>Then Felix, who was well acquainted with the Way, adjourned the proceedings. &#8220;When Lysias the commander comes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I will decide your case.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>He ordered the centurion to keep Paul under guard but to give him some freedom and permit his friends to take care of his needs.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>Several days later Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish. He sent for Paul and listened to him as he spoke about faith in Christ Jesus. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>As Paul talked about righteousness, self-control and the judgment to come, Felix was afraid and said, &#8220;That&#8217;s enough for now! You may leave. When I find it convenient, I will send for you.&#8221; 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>At the same time he was hoping that Paul would offer him a bribe, so he sent for him frequently and talked with him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>When two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, but because Felix wanted to grant a favor to the Jews, he left Paul in prison.</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><A name="footnotes"></a><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotebot">Some manuscripts include here <i>him, and we would have judged him in accordance with our law.
