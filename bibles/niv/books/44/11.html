<div class="chap"><p class="sectionhead">Peter Explains His Actions</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-1.htm"><b>1</b></a></span>The apostles and the believers throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcised believers criticized him 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>and said, &#8220;You went into the house of uncircumcised men and ate with them.&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>Starting from the beginning, Peter told them the whole story: 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>&#8220;I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision. I saw something like a large sheet being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came down to where I was. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>I looked into it and saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, reptiles and birds. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Then I heard a voice telling me, <span class="red">&#8216;Get up, Peter. Kill and eat.&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>&#8220;I replied, &#8216;Surely not, Lord! Nothing impure or unclean has ever entered my mouth.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;The voice spoke from heaven a second time, <span class="red">&#8216;Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.&#8217;</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>This happened three times, and then it was all pulled up to heaven again.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8220;Right then three men who had been sent to me from Caesarea stopped at the house where I was staying. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>The Spirit told me to have no hesitation about going with them. These six brothers also went with me, and we entered the man&#8217;s house. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>He told us how he had seen an angel appear in his house and say, &#8216;Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>He will bring you a message through which you and all your household will be saved.&#8217;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>&#8220;As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit came on them as he had come on us at the beginning. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>Then I remembered what the Lord had said: <span class="red">&#8216;John baptized with
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or in">a</a></sup></span>
 water, but you will be baptized with
<span class="nivfootnote"><sup><a href="#footnotes" title="Or in">b</a></sup></span>
 the Holy Spirit.&#8217;</span> 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>So if God gave them the same gift he gave us who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to think that I could stand in God&#8217;s way?&#8221;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>When they heard this, they had no further objections and praised God, saying, &#8220;So then, even to Gentiles God has granted repentance that leads to life.&#8221;</p>
<p class="sectionhead">The Church in Antioch</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>Now those who had been scattered by the persecution that broke out when Stephen was killed traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus and Antioch, spreading the word only among Jews. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>Some of them, however, men from Cyprus and Cyrene, went to Antioch and began to speak to Greeks also, telling them the good news about the Lord Jesus. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>The Lord&#8217;s hand was with them, and a great number of people believed and turned to the Lord.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>News of this reached the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>When he arrived and saw what the grace of God had done, he was glad and encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with all their hearts. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>He was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith, and a great number of people were brought to the Lord.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>and when he found him, he brought him to Antioch. So for a whole year Barnabas and Saul met with the church and taught great numbers of people. The disciples were called Christians first at Antioch.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>During this time some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-28.htm"><b>28</b></a></span>One of them, named Agabus, stood up and through the Spirit predicted that a severe famine would spread over the entire Roman world. (This happened during the reign of Claudius.) 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-29.htm"><b>29</b></a></span>The disciples, as each one was able, decided to provide help for the brothers and sisters living in Judea. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-30.htm"><b>30</b></a></span>This they did, sending their gift to the elders by Barnabas and Saul.</p><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"><span class="mainfootnotes"><A name="footnotes"></a><span class="mainfootnoteshdg">Footnotes:</span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">a</span> <span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotebot">Or <i>in</i></span><br><span class="nivfootnotesbot">b</span> <span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotebot">Or <i>in</i></span><br><hr size="1" color="DDEEFF"></div></div><div id="botbox">
