<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>&#8220;So he left the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Harran. After the death of his father, God sent him to this land where you are now living. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>He gave him no inheritance here, not even enough ground to set his foot on. But God promised him that he and his descendants after him would possess the land, even though at that time Abraham had no child. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>God spoke to him in this way: &#8216;For four hundred years your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own, and they will be enslaved and mistreated. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves,&#8217; God said, &#8216;and afterward they will come out of that country and worship me in this place.&#8217;

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>&#8220;Because the patriarchs were jealous of Joseph, they sold him as a slave into Egypt. But God was with him

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>&#8220;Then a famine struck all Egypt and Canaan, bringing great suffering, and our ancestors could not find food.
