<p class=bodytext><p class="bodytext"><a name="2Ch 23:1"></a><span class="versenum">1</span> In the seventh year Jehoiada made a bold move. He made a pact<a onclick=vOpenNote(14,23,231) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,14,23,231) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,14,23,231) ><SUP>1</SUP></A> with the officers of the units of hundreds: Azariah son of Jehoram, Ishmael son of Jehochanan, Azariah son of Obed, Maaseiah son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat son of Zikri. 
<a name="2Ch 23:2"></a><span class="versenum">2</span> They traveled throughout Judah and assembled the Levites from all the cities of Judah, as well as the Israelite family leaders.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They came to Jerusalem,<a onclick=vOpenNote(14,23,232) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,14,23,232) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,14,23,232) ><SUP>2</SUP></A> 
<a name="2Ch 23:3"></a><span class="versenum">3</span> and the whole assembly made a covenant with the king in the temple of God. Jehoiada<a onclick=vOpenNote(14,23,233) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,14,23,233) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,14,23,233) ><SUP>3</SUP></A> said to them, &#8220;The king&#8217;s son will rule, just as the <sc>Lord promised David&#8217;s descendants. 
<a name="2Ch 23:4"></a><span class="versenum">4</span> This is what you must do. One third of you priests and Levites who are on duty during the Sabbath will guard the doors. 
<a name="2Ch 23:5"></a><span class="versenum">5</span> Another third of you will be stationed at the royal palace and still another third at the Foundation Gate. All the others<a onclick=vOpenNote(14,23,234) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,14,23,234) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,14,23,234) ><SUP>4</SUP></A> will stand in the courtyards of the <sc>Lord&#8217;s temple. 
<a name="2Ch 23:6"></a><span class="versenum">6</span> No one must enter the <sc>Lord&#8217;s temple except the priests and Levites who are on duty. They may enter because they are ceremonially pure. All the others should carry out their assigned service to the <sc>Lord. 
<a name="2Ch 23:7"></a><span class="versenum">7</span> The Levites must surround the king. Each of you must hold his weapon in his hand. Whoever tries to enter the temple<a onclick=vOpenNote(14,23,235) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,14,23,235) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,14,23,235) ><SUP>5</SUP></A> must be killed. You must accompany the king wherever he goes.&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(14,23,236) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,14,23,236) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,14,23,236) ><SUP>6</SUP></A></p>

Each of them took his men, those who were on duty during the Sabbath as well as those who were off duty on the Sabbath. Jehoiada the priest did not release his divisions from their duties. 
<a name="2Ch 23:9"></a><span class="versenum">9</span> Jehoiada the priest gave to the officers of the units of hundreds King David&#8217;s spears and shields<a onclick=vOpenNote(14,23,238) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,14,23,238) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,14,23,238) ><SUP>8</SUP></A> that were kept in God&#8217;s temple. 
<a name="2Ch 23:10"></a><span class="versenum">10</span> He placed the men at their posts, each holding his weapon in his hand. They lined up from the south side of the temple to the north side and stood near the altar and the temple, surrounding the king.<a onclick=vOpenNote(14,23,239) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,14,23,239) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,14,23,239) ><SUP>9</SUP></A> 
<a name="2Ch 23:11"></a><span class="versenum">11</span> Jehoiada and his sons led out the king&#8217;s son and placed on him the crown and the royal insignia.<a onclick=vOpenNote(14,23,2310) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,14,23,2310) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,14,23,2310) ><SUP>10</SUP></A> They proclaimed him king and poured olive oil on his head.<a onclick=vOpenNote(14,23,2311) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,14,23,2311) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,14,23,2311) ><SUP>11</SUP></A> They declared, &#8220;Long live the king!&#8221;</p>

The officers and trumpeters stood beside the king and all the people of the land were celebrating and blowing trumpets, and the musicians with various instruments were leading the celebration. Athaliah tore her clothes and yelled, &#8220;Treason! Treason!&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(14,23,2315) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,14,23,2315) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,14,23,2315) ><SUP>15</SUP></A> 
<a name="2Ch 23:14"></a><span class="versenum">14</span> Jehoiada the priest sent out the officers of the units of hundreds, who were in charge of the army, and ordered them, &#8220;Bring her outside the temple to the guards.<a onclick=vOpenNote(14,23,2316) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,14,23,2316) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,14,23,2316) ><SUP>16</SUP></A> Put the sword to anyone who follows her.&#8221; The priest gave this order because he had decided she should not be executed in the <sc>Lord&#8217;s temple.<a onclick=vOpenNote(14,23,2317) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,14,23,2317) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,14,23,2317) ><SUP>17</SUP></A> 
<a name="2Ch 23:15"></a><span class="versenum">15</span> They seized her and took her into the precincts of the royal palace through the horses&#8217; entrance.<a onclick=vOpenNote(14,23,2318) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,14,23,2318) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,14,23,2318) ><SUP>18</SUP></A> There they executed her.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Ch 23:16"></a><span class="versenum">16</span> Jehoiada then drew up a covenant stipulating that he, all the people, and the king should be loyal to the <sc>Lord.<a onclick=vOpenNote(14,23,2319) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,14,23,2319) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,14,23,2319) ><SUP>19</SUP></A>

<a name="2Ch 23:18"></a><span class="versenum">18</span> Jehoiada then assigned the duties of the <sc>Lord&#8217;s temple to the priests, the Levites whom David had assigned to the <sc>Lord&#8217;s temple. They were responsible for offering burnt sacrifices to the <sc>Lord with joy and music, according to<a onclick=vOpenNote(14,23,2322) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,14,23,2322) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,14,23,2322) ><SUP>22</SUP></A> the law of Moses and the edict of David.
