<a name="2Ch 29:24"></a><span class="versenum">24</span> Then the priests slaughtered them.

<a name="2Ch 29:27"></a><span class="versenum">27</span> Hezekiah ordered the burnt sacrifice to be offered on the altar. As they began to offer the sacrifice, they also began to sing to the <sc>Lord, accompanied by the trumpets and the musical instruments of King David of Israel.
