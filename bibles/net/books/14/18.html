<a name="2Ch 18:8"></a><span class="versenum">8</span> The king of Israel summoned an officer and said, &#8220;Quickly bring Micaiah son of Imlah.&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">

All the prophets were prophesying before them. 
<a name="2Ch 18:10"></a><span class="versenum">10</span> Zedekiah son of Kenaanah made iron horns and said, &#8220;This is what the <sc>Lord says, &#8216;With these you will gore Syria until they are destroyed!&#8217;&#8221; 
<a name="2Ch 18:11"></a><span class="versenum">11</span> All the prophets were prophesying the same, saying, &#8220;Attack Ramoth Gilead! You will succeed; the <sc>Lord will hand it over to the king!&#8221; 
<a name="2Ch 18:12"></a><span class="versenum">12</span> Now the messenger who went to summon Micaiah said to him, &#8220;Look, the prophets are in complete agreement that the king will succeed.<a onclick=vOpenNote(14,18,1816) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,14,18,1816) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,14,18,1816) ><SUP>16</SUP></A> Your words must agree with theirs; you must predict success!&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(14,18,1817) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,14,18,1817) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,14,18,1817) ><SUP>17</SUP></A> 
<a name="2Ch 18:13"></a><span class="versenum">13</span> But Micaiah said, &#8220;As certainly as the <sc>Lord lives, I will say what my God tells me to say!&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">

You will succeed; they will be handed over to you.&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(14,18,1819) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,14,18,1819) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,14,18,1819) ><SUP>19</SUP></A> 
<a name="2Ch 18:15"></a><span class="versenum">15</span> The king said to him, &#8220;How many times must I make you solemnly promise in<a onclick=vOpenNote(14,18,1820) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,14,18,1820) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,14,18,1820) ><SUP>20</SUP></A> the name of the <sc>Lord to tell me only the truth?&#8221; 
<a name="2Ch 18:16"></a><span class="versenum">16</span> Micaiah<a onclick=vOpenNote(14,18,1821) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,14,18,1821) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,14,18,1821) ><SUP>21</SUP></A> replied, &#8220;I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains like sheep that have no shepherd. Then the <sc>Lord said, &#8216;They have no master. They should go home in peace.&#8217;&#8221; 
<a name="2Ch 18:17"></a><span class="versenum">17</span> The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell you he does not prophesy prosperity for me, but disaster?&#8221; 
<a name="2Ch 18:18"></a><span class="versenum">18</span> Micaiah<a onclick=vOpenNote(14,18,1822) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,14,18,1822) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,14,18,1822) ><SUP>22</SUP></A> said, &#8220;That being the case, hear the word of the <sc>Lord: I saw the <sc>Lord sitting on his throne, with all the heavenly assembly standing on his right and on his left. 
<a name="2Ch 18:19"></a><span class="versenum">19</span> The <sc>Lord said, &#8216;Who will deceive King Ahab of Israel, so he will attack Ramoth Gilead and die there?&#8217; One said this and another that. 
<a name="2Ch 18:20"></a><span class="versenum">20</span> Then a spirit<a onclick=vOpenNote(14,18,1823) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,14,18,1823) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,14,18,1823) ><SUP>23</SUP></A> stepped forward and stood before the <sc>Lord. He said, &#8216;I will deceive him.&#8217; The <sc>Lord asked him, &#8216;How?&#8217; 
<a name="2Ch 18:21"></a><span class="versenum">21</span> He replied, &#8216;I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets.&#8217; The <sc>Lord</><a onclick=vOpenNote(14,18,1824) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,14,18,1824) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,14,18,1824) ><SUP>24</SUP></A> said, &#8216;Deceive and overpower him.<a onclick=vOpenNote(14,18,1825) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,14,18,1825) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,14,18,1825) ><SUP>25</SUP></A> Go out and do as you have proposed.&#8217; 
<a name="2Ch 18:22"></a><span class="versenum">22</span> So now, look, the <sc>Lord has placed a lying spirit in the mouths of all these prophets of yours; but the <sc>Lord has decreed disaster for you.&#8221; 
<a name="2Ch 18:23"></a><span class="versenum">23</span> Zedekiah son of Kenaanah approached, hit Micaiah on the jaw, and said, &#8220;Which way did the <sc>Lord&#8217;s spirit go when he went from me to speak to you?&#8221; 
<a name="2Ch 18:24"></a><span class="versenum">24</span> Micaiah replied, &#8220;Look, you will see in the day when you go into an inner room to hide.&#8221; 
<a name="2Ch 18:25"></a><span class="versenum">25</span> Then the king of Israel said, &#8220;Take Micaiah and return him to Amon the city official and Joash the king&#8217;s son. 
<a name="2Ch 18:26"></a><span class="versenum">26</span> Say, &#8216;This is what the king says: &#8220;Put this man in prison. Give him only a little bread and water<a onclick=vOpenNote(14,18,1826) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,14,18,1826) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,14,18,1826) ><SUP>26</SUP></A> until I return safely.&#8221;&#8217;&#8221; 
<a name="2Ch 18:27"></a><span class="versenum">27</span> Micaiah said, &#8220;If you really do return safely, then the <sc>Lord has not spoken through me!&#8221; Then he added, &#8220;Take note,<a onclick=vOpenNote(14,18,1827) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,14,18,1827) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,14,18,1827) ><SUP>27</SUP></A> all you people.&#8221;</p>

<a name="2Ch 18:28"></a><span class="versenum">28</span> The king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah attacked Ramoth Gilead.

<a name="2Ch 18:31"></a><span class="versenum">31</span> When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they said, &#8220;He must be the king of Israel!&#8221; So they turned and attacked him, but Jehoshaphat cried out. The <sc>Lord helped him; God lured them away from him. 
<a name="2Ch 18:32"></a><span class="versenum">32</span> When the chariot commanders realized he was not the king of Israel, they turned away from him. 
<a name="2Ch 18:33"></a><span class="versenum">33</span> Now an archer shot an arrow at random<a onclick=vOpenNote(14,18,1830) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,14,18,1830) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,14,18,1830) ><SUP>30</SUP></A> and it struck the king of Israel between the plates of his armor. The king<a onclick=vOpenNote(14,18,1831) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,14,18,1831) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,14,18,1831) ><SUP>31</SUP></A> ordered his charioteer, &#8220;Turn around and take me from the battle line,<a onclick=vOpenNote(14,18,1832) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,14,18,1832) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,14,18,1832) ><SUP>32</SUP></A> for I am wounded.&#8221; 
<a name="2Ch 18:34"></a><span class="versenum">34</span> While the battle raged throughout the day, the king stood propped up in his chariot opposite the Syrians. He died in the evening as the sun was setting.</p>
