<a name="2Ch 35:7"></a><span class="versenum">7</span> From his own royal flocks and herds, Josiah supplied the people with 30,000 lambs and goats for the Passover sacrifice, as well as 3,000 cattle.<a onclick=vOpenNote(14,35,355) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,14,35,355) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,14,35,355) ><SUP>5</SUP></A> 
<a name="2Ch 35:8"></a><span class="versenum">8</span> His officials also willingly contributed to the people, priests, and Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, the leaders of God&#8217;s temple, supplied 2,600 Passover sacrifices and 300 cattle. 
<a name="2Ch 35:9"></a><span class="versenum">9</span> Konaniah and his brothers Shemaiah and Nethanel, along with Hashabiah, Jeiel, and Jozabad, the officials of the Levites, supplied the Levites with 5,000 Passover sacrifices and 500 cattle. 
<a name="2Ch 35:10"></a><span class="versenum">10</span> Preparations were made,<a onclick=vOpenNote(14,35,356) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,14,35,356) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,14,35,356) ><SUP>6</SUP></A> and the priests stood at their posts and the Levites in their divisions as prescribed by the king. 
<a name="2Ch 35:11"></a><span class="versenum">11</span> They slaughtered the Passover lambs and the priests splashed the blood,<a onclick=vOpenNote(14,35,357) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,14,35,357) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,14,35,357) ><SUP>7</SUP></A> while the Levites skinned the animals. 
<a name="2Ch 35:12"></a><span class="versenum">12</span> They reserved the burnt offerings and the cattle for the family divisions of the people to present to the <sc>Lord, as prescribed in the scroll of Moses.<a onclick=vOpenNote(14,35,358) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,14,35,358) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,14,35,358) ><SUP>8</SUP></A> 
<a name="2Ch 35:13"></a><span class="versenum">13</span> They cooked the Passover sacrifices over the open fire as prescribed and cooked the consecrated offerings in pots, kettles, and pans. They quickly served them to all the people. 
<a name="2Ch 35:14"></a><span class="versenum">14</span> Afterward they made preparations for themselves and for the priests, because the priests, the descendants of Aaron, were offering burnt sacrifices and fat portions until evening. The Levites made preparations for themselves and for the priests, the descendants of Aaron. 
<a name="2Ch 35:15"></a><span class="versenum">15</span> The musicians, the descendants of Asaph, manned their posts, as prescribed by David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun the king&#8217;s prophet.<a onclick=vOpenNote(14,35,359) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,14,35,359) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,14,35,359) ><SUP>9</SUP></A> The guards at the various gates did not need to leave their posts, for their fellow Levites made preparations for them. 
<a name="2Ch 35:16"></a><span class="versenum">16</span> So all the preparations for the <sc>Lord&#8217;s service were made that day, as the Passover was observed and the burnt sacrifices were offered on the altar of the <sc>Lord, as prescribed by King Josiah. 
<a name="2Ch 35:17"></a><span class="versenum">17</span> So the Israelites who were present observed the Passover at that time, as well as the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days. 
<a name="2Ch 35:18"></a><span class="versenum">18</span> A Passover like this had not been observed in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet. None of the kings of Israel had observed a Passover like the one celebrated by Josiah, the priests, the Levites, all the people of Judah and Israel who were there, and the residents of Jerusalem. 
<a name="2Ch 35:19"></a><span class="versenum">19</span> This Passover was observed in the eighteenth year of Josiah&#8217;s reign.</p>
