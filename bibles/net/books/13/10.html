So Saul took the sword and fell on it. 
<a name="1Ch 10:5"></a><span class="versenum">5</span> When his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his sword and died. 
<a name="1Ch 10:6"></a><span class="versenum">6</span> So Saul and his three sons died; his whole household<a onclick=vOpenNote(13,10,107) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,13,10,107) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,13,10,107) ><SUP>7</SUP></A> died together.

<a name="1Ch 10:9"></a><span class="versenum">9</span> They stripped his corpse, and then carried off his head and his armor. They sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines proclaiming the news to their idols and their people. 
<a name="1Ch 10:10"></a><span class="versenum">10</span> They placed his armor in the temple of their gods<a onclick=vOpenNote(13,10,109) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,13,10,109) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,13,10,109) ><SUP>9</SUP></A> and hung his head in the temple of Dagon.
