<a name="1Ki 17:2"></a><span class="versenum">2</span> The <sc>Lord told him:<a onclick=vOpenNote(11,17,173) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,11,17,173) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,11,17,173) ><SUP>3</SUP></A> 
<a name="1Ki 17:3"></a><span class="versenum">3</span> &#8220;Leave here and travel eastward. Hide out in the Kerith Valley near the Jordan. 
<a name="1Ki 17:4"></a><span class="versenum">4</span> Drink from the stream; I have already told<a onclick=vOpenNote(11,17,174) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,11,17,174) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,11,17,174) ><SUP>4</SUP></A> the ravens to bring you food<a onclick=vOpenNote(11,17,175) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,11,17,175) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,11,17,175) ><SUP>5</SUP></A> there.&#8221; 
<a name="1Ki 17:5"></a><span class="versenum">5</span> So he did<a onclick=vOpenNote(11,17,176) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,11,17,176) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,11,17,176) ><SUP>6</SUP></A> as the <sc>Lord told him; he went and lived in the Kerith Valley near the Jordan. 
<a name="1Ki 17:6"></a><span class="versenum">6</span> The ravens would bring him bread and meat each morning and evening, and he would drink from the stream.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Ki 17:7"></a><span class="versenum">7</span> After a while,<a onclick=vOpenNote(11,17,177) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,11,17,177) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,11,17,177) ><SUP>7</SUP></A> the stream dried up because there had been no rain in the land. 
<a name="1Ki 17:8"></a><span class="versenum">8</span> The <sc>Lord told him,<a onclick=vOpenNote(11,17,178) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,11,17,178) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,11,17,178) ><SUP>8</SUP></A> 
<a name="1Ki 17:9"></a><span class="versenum">9</span> &#8220;Get up, go to Zarephath in Sidonian territory, and live there. I have already told<a onclick=vOpenNote(11,17,179) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,11,17,179) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,11,17,179) ><SUP>9</SUP></A> a widow who lives there to provide for you.&#8221; 
<a name="1Ki 17:10"></a><span class="versenum">10</span> So he got up and went to Zarephath. When he went through the city gate, there was a widow gathering wood. He called out to her, &#8220;Please give me a cup<a onclick=vOpenNote(11,17,1710) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,11,17,1710) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,11,17,1710) ><SUP>10</SUP></A> of water, so I can take a drink.&#8221; 
<a name="1Ki 17:11"></a><span class="versenum">11</span> As she went to get it, he called out to her, &#8220;Please bring me a piece of bread.&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(11,17,1711) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,11,17,1711) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,11,17,1711) ><SUP>11</SUP></A> 
<a name="1Ki 17:12"></a><span class="versenum">12</span> She said, &#8220;As certainly as the <sc>Lord your God lives, I have no food, except for a handful of flour in a jar and a little olive oil in a jug. Right now I am gathering a couple of sticks for a fire. Then I&#8217;m going home to make one final meal for my son and myself. After we have eaten that, we will die of starvation.&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(11,17,1712) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,11,17,1712) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,11,17,1712) ><SUP>12</SUP></A> 
<a name="1Ki 17:13"></a><span class="versenum">13</span> Elijah said to her, &#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid. Go and do as you planned.<a onclick=vOpenNote(11,17,1713) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,11,17,1713) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,11,17,1713) ><SUP>13</SUP></A> But first make a small cake for me and bring it to me; then make something for yourself and your son. 
<a name="1Ki 17:14"></a><span class="versenum">14</span> For this is what the <sc>Lord God of Israel says, &#8216;The jar of flour will not be empty and the jug of oil will not run out until the day the <sc>Lord makes it rain on the surface of the ground.&#8217;&#8221; 
<a name="1Ki 17:15"></a><span class="versenum">15</span> She went and did as Elijah told her; there was always enough food for Elijah and for her and her family.<a onclick=vOpenNote(11,17,1714) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,11,17,1714) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,11,17,1714) ><SUP>14</SUP></A> 
<a name="1Ki 17:16"></a><span class="versenum">16</span> The jar of flour was never empty and the jug of oil never ran out, just as the <sc>Lord had promised<a onclick=vOpenNote(11,17,1715) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,11,17,1715) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,11,17,1715) ><SUP>15</SUP></A> through Elijah.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Ki 17:17"></a><span class="versenum">17</span> After this<a onclick=vOpenNote(11,17,1716) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,11,17,1716) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,11,17,1716) ><SUP>16</SUP></A> the son of the woman who owned the house got sick. His illness was so severe he could no longer breathe. 
<a name="1Ki 17:18"></a><span class="versenum">18</span> She asked Elijah, &#8220;Why, prophet, have you come<a onclick=vOpenNote(11,17,1717) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,11,17,1717) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,11,17,1717) ><SUP>17</SUP></A> to me to confront me with<a onclick=vOpenNote(11,17,1718) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,11,17,1718) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,11,17,1718) ><SUP>18</SUP></A> my sin and kill my son?&#8221; 
<a name="1Ki 17:19"></a><span class="versenum">19</span> He said to her, &#8220;Hand me your son.&#8221; He took him from her arms, carried him to the upper room where he was staying, and laid him down on his bed. 
<a name="1Ki 17:20"></a><span class="versenum">20</span> Then he called out to the <sc>Lord, &#8220;O <sc>Lord, my God, are you also bringing disaster on this widow I am staying with by killing her son?&#8221; 
<a name="1Ki 17:21"></a><span class="versenum">21</span> He stretched out over the boy three times and called out to the <sc>Lord, &#8220;O <sc>Lord, my God, please let this boy&#8217;s breath return to him.&#8221; 
<a name="1Ki 17:22"></a><span class="versenum">22</span> The <sc>Lord answered Elijah&#8217;s prayer; the boy&#8217;s breath returned to him and he lived. 
<a name="1Ki 17:23"></a><span class="versenum">23</span> Elijah took the boy, brought him down from the upper room to the house, and handed him to his mother. Elijah then said, &#8220;See, your son is alive!&#8221; 
<a name="1Ki 17:24"></a><span class="versenum">24</span> The woman said to Elijah, &#8220;Now I know that you are a prophet and that the <sc>Lord really does speak through you.&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(11,17,1719) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,11,17,1719) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,11,17,1719) ><SUP>19</SUP></A></p>
