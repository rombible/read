<a name="1Ki 22:9"></a><span class="versenum">9</span> The king of Israel summoned an official and said, &#8220;Quickly bring Micaiah son of Imlah.&#8221; </p>

<a name="1Ki 22:14"></a><span class="versenum">14</span> But Micaiah said, &#8220;As certainly as the <sc>Lord lives, I will say what the <sc>Lord tells me to say.&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Ki 22:15"></a><span class="versenum">15</span> When he came before the king, the king asked him, &#8220;Micaiah, should we attack Ramoth Gilead or not?&#8221; He answered him, &#8220;Attack!

Then the <sc>Lord said, &#8216;They have no master. They should go home in peace.&#8217;&#8221; 
<a name="1Ki 22:18"></a><span class="versenum">18</span> The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell you he does not prophesy prosperity for me, but disaster?&#8221; 
<a name="1Ki 22:19"></a><span class="versenum">19</span> Micaiah<a onclick=vOpenNote(11,22,2219) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,11,22,2219) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,11,22,2219) ><SUP>19</SUP></A> said, &#8220;That being the case, hear the word of the <sc>Lord. I saw the <sc>Lord sitting on his throne, with all the heavenly assembly standing on his right and on his left. 
<a name="1Ki 22:20"></a><span class="versenum">20</span> The <sc>Lord said, &#8216;Who will deceive Ahab, so he will attack Ramoth Gilead and die<a onclick=vOpenNote(11,22,2220) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,11,22,2220) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,11,22,2220) ><SUP>20</SUP></A> there?&#8217; One said this and another that. 
<a name="1Ki 22:21"></a><span class="versenum">21</span> Then a spirit<a onclick=vOpenNote(11,22,2221) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,11,22,2221) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,11,22,2221) ><SUP>21</SUP></A> stepped forward and stood before the <sc>Lord. He said, &#8216;I will deceive him.&#8217; The <sc>Lord asked him, &#8216;How?&#8217; 
<a name="1Ki 22:22"></a><span class="versenum">22</span> He replied, &#8216;I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets.&#8217; The <sc>Lord</><a onclick=vOpenNote(11,22,2222) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,11,22,2222) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,11,22,2222) ><SUP>22</SUP></A> said, &#8216;Deceive and overpower him.<a onclick=vOpenNote(11,22,2223) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,11,22,2223) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,11,22,2223) ><SUP>23</SUP></A> Go out and do as you have proposed.&#8217; 
<a name="1Ki 22:23"></a><span class="versenum">23</span> So now, look, the <sc>Lord has placed a lying spirit in the mouths of all these prophets of yours; but the <sc>Lord has decreed disaster for you.&#8221; 
<a name="1Ki 22:24"></a><span class="versenum">24</span> Zedekiah son of Kenaanah approached, hit Micaiah on the jaw, and said, &#8220;Which way did the <sc>Lord&#8217;s spirit go when he went from me to speak to you?&#8221; 
<a name="1Ki 22:25"></a><span class="versenum">25</span> Micaiah replied, &#8220;Look, you will see in the day when you go into an inner room to hide.&#8221; 
<a name="1Ki 22:26"></a><span class="versenum">26</span> Then the king of Israel said, &#8220;Take Micaiah and return him to Amon the city official and Joash the king&#8217;s son. 
<a name="1Ki 22:27"></a><span class="versenum">27</span> Say, &#8216;This is what the king says, &#8220;Put this man in prison.

<a name="1Ki 22:28"></a><span class="versenum">28</span> Micaiah said, &#8220;If you really do safely return, then the <sc>Lord has not spoken through me.&#8221; Then he added, &#8220;Take note,<a onclick=vOpenNote(11,22,2226) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,11,22,2226) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,11,22,2226) ><SUP>26</SUP></A> all you people.&#8221;</p>

<a name="1Ki 22:29"></a><span class="versenum">29</span> The king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah attacked Ramoth Gilead.

<a name="1Ki 22:31"></a><span class="versenum">31</span> Now the king of Syria had ordered his thirty-two chariot commanders, &#8220;Do not fight common soldiers or high-ranking officers;<a onclick=vOpenNote(11,22,2228) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,11,22,2228) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,11,22,2228) ><SUP>28</SUP></A> fight only the king of Israel.&#8221; 
<a name="1Ki 22:32"></a><span class="versenum">32</span> When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they said, &#8220;He must be the king of Israel.&#8221; So they turned and attacked him, but Jehoshaphat cried out. 
<a name="1Ki 22:33"></a><span class="versenum">33</span> When the chariot commanders realized he was not the king of Israel, they turned away from him.
