<a name="1Ki 19:2"></a><span class="versenum">2</span> Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah with this warning,<a onclick=vOpenNote(11,19,191) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,11,19,191) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,11,19,191) ><SUP>1</SUP></A> &#8220;May the gods judge me severely<a onclick=vOpenNote(11,19,192) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,11,19,192) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,11,19,192) ><SUP>2</SUP></A> if by this time tomorrow I do not take your life as you did theirs!&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(11,19,193) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,11,19,193) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,11,19,193) ><SUP>3</SUP></A></p>

He left his servant there, 
<a name="1Ki 19:4"></a><span class="versenum">4</span> while he went a day&#8217;s journey into the desert. He went and sat down under a shrub<a onclick=vOpenNote(11,19,195) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,11,19,195) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,11,19,195) ><SUP>5</SUP></A> and asked the <sc>Lord to take his life:<a onclick=vOpenNote(11,19,196) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,11,19,196) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,11,19,196) ><SUP>6</SUP></A> &#8220;I&#8217;ve had enough! Now, O <sc>Lord, take my life. After all, I&#8217;m no better than my ancestors.&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(11,19,197) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,11,19,197) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,11,19,197) ><SUP>7</SUP></A> 
<a name="1Ki 19:5"></a><span class="versenum">5</span> He stretched out<a onclick=vOpenNote(11,19,198) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,11,19,198) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,11,19,198) ><SUP>8</SUP></A> and fell asleep under the shrub. All of a sudden an angelic messenger<a onclick=vOpenNote(11,19,199) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,11,19,199) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,11,19,199) ><SUP>9</SUP></A> touched him and said, &#8220;Get up and eat.&#8221; 
<a name="1Ki 19:6"></a><span class="versenum">6</span> He looked and right there by his head was a cake baking on hot coals and a jug of water. He ate and drank and then slept some more.<a onclick=vOpenNote(11,19,1910) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,11,19,1910) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,11,19,1910) ><SUP>10</SUP></A> 
<a name="1Ki 19:7"></a><span class="versenum">7</span> The <sc>Lord&#8217;s angelic messenger came back again, touched him, and said, &#8220;Get up and eat, for otherwise you won&#8217;t be able to make the journey.&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(11,19,1911) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,11,19,1911) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,11,19,1911) ><SUP>11</SUP></A> 
<a name="1Ki 19:8"></a><span class="versenum">8</span> So he got up and ate and drank. That meal gave him the strength to travel forty days and forty nights until he reached Horeb, the mountain of God.</p>

<a name="1Ki 19:9"></a><span class="versenum">9</span> He went into a cave there and spent the night. All of a sudden the <sc>Lord spoke to him, &#8220;Why are you here, Elijah?&#8221; 
<a name="1Ki 19:10"></a><span class="versenum">10</span> He answered, &#8220;I have been absolutely loyal<a onclick=vOpenNote(11,19,1912) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,11,19,1912) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,11,19,1912) ><SUP>12</SUP></A> to the <sc>Lord, the sovereign God,<a onclick=vOpenNote(11,19,1913) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,11,19,1913) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,11,19,1913) ><SUP>13</SUP></A> even though the Israelites have abandoned the agreement they made with you,<a onclick=vOpenNote(11,19,1914) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,11,19,1914) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,11,19,1914) ><SUP>14</SUP></A> torn down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword.

<p class="bodytext">A very powerful wind went before the <sc>Lord, digging into the mountain and causing landslides,<a onclick=vOpenNote(11,19,1917) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,11,19,1917) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,11,19,1917) ><SUP>17</SUP></A> but the <sc>Lord was not in the wind.

<a name="1Ki 19:12"></a><span class="versenum">12</span> After the earthquake, there was a fire, but the <sc>Lord was not in the fire. After the fire, there was a soft whisper.<a onclick=vOpenNote(11,19,1918) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,11,19,1918) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,11,19,1918) ><SUP>18</SUP></A> 
<a name="1Ki 19:13"></a><span class="versenum">13</span> When Elijah heard it, he covered his face with his robe and went out and stood at the entrance to the cave.

<a name="1Ki 19:15"></a><span class="versenum">15</span> The <sc>Lord said to him, &#8220;Go back the way you came and then head for the Desert of Damascus. Go and anoint Hazael king over Syria. 
<a name="1Ki 19:16"></a><span class="versenum">16</span> You must anoint Jehu son of Nimshi king over Israel, and Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel Meholah to take your place as prophet.

<a name="1Ki 19:18"></a><span class="versenum">18</span> I still have left in Israel seven thousand followers who have not bowed their knees to Baal or kissed the images of him.&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(11,19,1924) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,11,19,1924) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,11,19,1924) ><SUP>24</SUP></A></p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Ki 19:19"></a><span class="versenum">19</span> Elijah went from there and found Elisha son of Shaphat. He was plowing with twelve pairs of oxen; he was near the twelfth pair. Elijah passed by him and threw his robe over him. 
<a name="1Ki 19:20"></a><span class="versenum">20</span> He left the oxen, ran after Elijah, and said, &#8220;Please let me kiss my father and mother goodbye, then I will follow you.&#8221; Elijah<a onclick=vOpenNote(11,19,1925) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,11,19,1925) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,11,19,1925) ><SUP>25</SUP></A> said to him, &#8220;Go back!

He cooked the meat over a fire that he made by burning the harness and yoke.<a onclick=vOpenNote(11,19,1927) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,11,19,1927) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,11,19,1927) ><SUP>27</SUP></A> He gave the people meat and they ate.
