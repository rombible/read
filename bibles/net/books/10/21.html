<p class=bodytext><p class="paragraphtitle">The Gibeonites Demand Revenge</p><p class="bodytext"><a name="2Sa 21:1"></a><span class="versenum">1</span> During David&#8217;s reign there was a famine for three consecutive years. So David inquired of the <sc>Lord.<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,21,211) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,21,211) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,21,211) ><SUP>1</SUP></A> The <sc>Lord said, &#8220;It is because of Saul and his bloodstained family,<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,21,212) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,21,212) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,21,212) ><SUP>2</SUP></A> because he murdered the Gibeonites.&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Sa 21:2"></a><span class="versenum">2</span> So the king summoned the Gibeonites and spoke with them. (Now the Gibeonites were not descendants of Israel; they were a remnant of the Amorites. The Israelites had made a promise to<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,21,213) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,21,213) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,21,213) ><SUP>3</SUP></A> them, but Saul tried to kill them because of his zeal for the people of Israel and Judah.) 
<a name="2Sa 21:3"></a><span class="versenum">3</span> David said to the Gibeonites, &#8220;What can I do for you, and how can I make amends so that you will bless<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,21,214) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,21,214) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,21,214) ><SUP>4</SUP></A> the <sc>Lord&#8217;s inheritance?&#8221; </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Sa 21:4"></a><span class="versenum">4</span> The Gibeonites said to him, &#8220;We<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,21,215) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,21,215) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,21,215) ><SUP>5</SUP></A> have no claim to silver or gold from Saul or from his family,<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,21,216) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,21,216) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,21,216) ><SUP>6</SUP></A> nor would we be justified in putting to death anyone in Israel.&#8221; David asked,<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,21,217) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,21,217) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,21,217) ><SUP>7</SUP></A> &#8220;What then are you asking me to do for you?&#8221; 
<a name="2Sa 21:5"></a><span class="versenum">5</span> They replied to the king, &#8220;As for this man who exterminated us and who schemed against us so that we were destroyed and left without status throughout all the borders of Israel &#8211; 
<a name="2Sa 21:6"></a><span class="versenum">6</span> let seven of his male descendants be turned over to us, and we will execute<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,21,218) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,21,218) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,21,218) ><SUP>8</SUP></A> them before the <sc>Lord in Gibeah of Saul, who was the <sc>Lord&#8217;s chosen one.&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,21,219) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,21,219) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,21,219) ><SUP>9</SUP></A> The king replied, &#8220;I will turn them over.&#8221; </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Sa 21:7"></a><span class="versenum">7</span> The king had mercy on Mephibosheth son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, in light of the <sc>Lord&#8217;s oath that had been taken between David and Jonathan son of Saul. 
<a name="2Sa 21:8"></a><span class="versenum">8</span> So the king took Armoni and Mephibosheth, the two sons of Aiah&#8217;s daughter Rizpah whom she had born to Saul, and the five sons of Saul&#8217;s daughter Merab<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,21,2110) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,21,2110) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,21,2110) ><SUP>10</SUP></A> whom she had born to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite. 
<a name="2Sa 21:9"></a><span class="versenum">9</span> He turned them over to the Gibeonites, and they executed them on a hill before the <sc>Lord. The seven of them<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,21,2111) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,21,2111) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,21,2111) ><SUP>11</SUP></A> died<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,21,2112) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,21,2112) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,21,2112) ><SUP>12</SUP></A> together; they were put to death during harvest time &#8211; during the first days of the beginning<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,21,2113) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,21,2113) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,21,2113) ><SUP>13</SUP></A> of the barley harvest. </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Sa 21:10"></a><span class="versenum">10</span> Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it out for herself on a rock. From the beginning of the harvest until the rain fell on them,<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,21,2114) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,21,2114) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,21,2114) ><SUP>14</SUP></A> she did not allow the birds of the air to feed<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,21,2115) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,21,2115) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,21,2115) ><SUP>15</SUP></A> on them by day, nor the wild animals<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,21,2116) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,21,2116) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,21,2116) ><SUP>16</SUP></A> by night. 
<a name="2Sa 21:11"></a><span class="versenum">11</span> When David was told what Rizpah daughter of Aiah, Saul&#8217;s concubine, had done,

(They had secretly taken<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,21,2120) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,21,2120) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,21,2120) ><SUP>20</SUP></A> them from the plaza at Beth Shan. It was there that Philistines<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,21,2121) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,21,2121) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,21,2121) ><SUP>21</SUP></A> publicly exposed their corpses<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,21,2122) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,21,2122) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,21,2122) ><SUP>22</SUP></A> after<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,21,2123) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,21,2123) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,21,2123) ><SUP>23</SUP></A> they<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,21,2124) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,21,2124) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,21,2124) ><SUP>24</SUP></A> had killed Saul at Gilboa.)

<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Sa 21:14"></a><span class="versenum">14</span> They buried the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan in the land of Benjamin at Zela in the grave of his father Kish. After they had done everything<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,21,2126) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,21,2126) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,21,2126) ><SUP>26</SUP></A> that the king had commanded, God responded to their prayers<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,21,2127) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,21,2127) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,21,2127) ><SUP>27</SUP></A> for the land.</p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Israel Engages in Various Battles with the Philistines</p><p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Sa 21:15"></a><span class="versenum">15</span> Another battle was fought between the Philistines and Israel. So David went down with his soldiers<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,21,2128) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,21,2128) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,21,2128) ><SUP>28</SUP></A> and fought the Philistines. David became exhausted. 
<a name="2Sa 21:16"></a><span class="versenum">16</span> Now Ishbi-Benob, one of the descendants of Rapha,<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,21,2129) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,21,2129) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,21,2129) ><SUP>29</SUP></A> had a spear<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,21,2130) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,21,2130) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,21,2130) ><SUP>30</SUP></A> that weighed three hundred bronze shekels,<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,21,2131) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,21,2131) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,21,2131) ><SUP>31</SUP></A> and he was armed with a new weapon.<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,21,2132) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,21,2132) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,21,2132) ><SUP>32</SUP></A> He had said that he would kill David. 
<a name="2Sa 21:17"></a><span class="versenum">17</span> But Abishai the son of Zeruiah came to David&#8217;s aid, striking the Philistine down and killing him. Then David&#8217;s men took an oath saying, &#8220;You will not go out to battle with us again! You must not extinguish the lamp of Israel!&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Sa 21:18"></a><span class="versenum">18</span> Later there was another battle with the Philistines, this time in Gob. On that occasion Sibbekai the Hushathite killed Saph, who was one of the descendants of Rapha. 
<a name="2Sa 21:19"></a><span class="versenum">19</span> Yet another battle occurred with the Philistines in Gob. On that occasion Elhanan the son of Jair<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,21,2133) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,21,2133) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,21,2133) ><SUP>33</SUP></A> the Bethlehemite killed the brother of Goliath the Gittite,<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,21,2134) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,21,2134) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,21,2134) ><SUP>34</SUP></A> the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver&#8217;s beam. 
<a name="2Sa 21:20"></a><span class="versenum">20</span> Yet another battle occurred in Gath. On that occasion there was a large man<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,21,2135) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,21,2135) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,21,2135) ><SUP>35</SUP></A> who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in all! He too was a descendant of Rapha. 
<a name="2Sa 21:21"></a><span class="versenum">21</span> When he taunted Israel, Jonathan, the son of David&#8217;s brother Shimeah, killed him.
