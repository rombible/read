<a name="2Sa 1:2"></a><span class="versenum">2</span> On the third day a man arrived from the camp of Saul with his clothes torn and dirt on his head.<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,1,14) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,1,14) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,1,14) ><SUP>4</SUP></A> When he approached David, the man<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,1,15) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,1,15) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,1,15) ><SUP>5</SUP></A> threw himself to the ground.<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,1,16) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,1,16) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,1,16) ><SUP>6</SUP></A></p>

<a name="2Sa 1:3"></a><span class="versenum">3</span> David asked him, &#8220;Where are you coming from?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;I have escaped from the camp of Israel.&#8221; 
<a name="2Sa 1:4"></a><span class="versenum">4</span> David inquired, &#8220;How were things going?<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,1,17) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,1,17) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,1,17) ><SUP>7</SUP></A> Tell me!&#8221; He replied, &#8220;The people fled from the battle and many of them<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,1,18) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,1,18) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,1,18) ><SUP>8</SUP></A> fell dead.<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,1,19) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,1,19) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,1,19) ><SUP>9</SUP></A> Even Saul and his son Jonathan are dead!&#8221; 
<a name="2Sa 1:5"></a><span class="versenum">5</span> David said to the young man<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,1,110) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,1,110) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,1,110) ><SUP>10</SUP></A> who was telling him this, &#8220;How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,1,111) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,1,111) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,1,111) ><SUP>11</SUP></A> 
<a name="2Sa 1:6"></a><span class="versenum">6</span> The young man who was telling him this<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,1,112) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,1,112) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,1,112) ><SUP>12</SUP></A> said, &#8220;I just happened to be on Mount Gilboa and came across Saul leaning on his spear for support. The chariots and leaders of the horsemen were in hot pursuit of him. 
<a name="2Sa 1:7"></a><span class="versenum">7</span> When he turned around and saw me, he called out to me. I answered, &#8216;Here I am!&#8217; 
<a name="2Sa 1:8"></a><span class="versenum">8</span> He asked me, &#8216;Who are you?&#8217; I told him, &#8216;I&#8217;m<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,1,113) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,1,113) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,1,113) ><SUP>13</SUP></A> an Amalekite.&#8217; 
<a name="2Sa 1:9"></a><span class="versenum">9</span> He said to me, &#8216;Stand over me and finish me off!<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,1,114) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,1,114) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,1,114) ><SUP>14</SUP></A> I&#8217;m very dizzy,<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,1,115) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,1,115) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,1,115) ><SUP>15</SUP></A> even though I&#8217;m still alive.&#8217;<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,1,116) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,1,116) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,1,116) ><SUP>16</SUP></A> 
<a name="2Sa 1:10"></a><span class="versenum">10</span> So I stood over him and put him to death, since I knew that he couldn&#8217;t live in such a condition.<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,1,117) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,1,117) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,1,117) ><SUP>17</SUP></A> Then I took the crown which was on his head and the<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,1,118) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,1,118) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,1,118) ><SUP>18</SUP></A> bracelet which was on his arm. I have brought them here to my lord.&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,1,119) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,1,119) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,1,119) ><SUP>19</SUP></A></p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Sa 1:11"></a><span class="versenum">11</span> David then grabbed his own clothes<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,1,120) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,1,120) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,1,120) ><SUP>20</SUP></A> and tore them, as did all the men who were with him. 
<a name="2Sa 1:12"></a><span class="versenum">12</span> They lamented and wept and fasted until evening because Saul, his son Jonathan, the <sc>Lord&#8217;s people, and the house of Israel had fallen by the sword.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Sa 1:13"></a><span class="versenum">13</span> David said to the young man who told this to him, &#8220;Where are you from?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;I am an Amalekite, the son of a resident foreigner.&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,1,121) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,1,121) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,1,121) ><SUP>21</SUP></A> 
<a name="2Sa 1:14"></a><span class="versenum">14</span> David replied to him, &#8220;How is it that you were not afraid to reach out your hand to destroy the <sc>Lord&#8217;s anointed?&#8221; 
<a name="2Sa 1:15"></a><span class="versenum">15</span> Then David called one of the soldiers<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,1,122) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,1,122) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,1,122) ><SUP>22</SUP></A> and said, &#8220;Come here and strike him down!&#8221; So he struck him down, and he died. 
<a name="2Sa 1:16"></a><span class="versenum">16</span> David said to him, &#8220;Your blood be on your own head! Your own mouth has testified against you, saying &#8216;I have put the <sc>Lord&#8217;s anointed to death.&#8217;&#8221; </p>
