<p class=bodytext><p class="bodytext"><a name="2Sa 19:1"></a><span class="versenum">1</span> <b>(19:2)</b> Joab was told, &#8220;The king is weeping and mourning over Absalom.&#8221; 
<a name="2Sa 19:2"></a><span class="versenum">2</span> So the victory of that day was turned to mourning as far as all the people were concerned. For the people heard on that day, &#8220;The king is grieved over his son.&#8221; 
<a name="2Sa 19:3"></a><span class="versenum">3</span> That day the people stole away to go to the city the way people who are embarrassed steal away in fleeing from battle. 
<a name="2Sa 19:4"></a><span class="versenum">4</span> The king covered his face and cried out loudly,<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,19,191) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,19,191) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,19,191) ><SUP>1</SUP></A> &#8220;My son, Absalom!

<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Sa 19:5"></a><span class="versenum">5</span> So Joab visited<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,19,192) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,19,192) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,19,192) ><SUP>2</SUP></A> the king at his home. He said, &#8220;Today you have embarrassed all your servants who have saved your life this day, as well as the lives of your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your concubines. 
<a name="2Sa 19:6"></a><span class="versenum">6</span> You seem to love your enemies and hate your friends! For you have as much as declared today that leaders and servants don&#8217;t matter to you. I realize now<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,19,193) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,19,193) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,19,193) ><SUP>3</SUP></A> that if<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,19,194) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,19,194) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,19,194) ><SUP>4</SUP></A> Absalom were alive and all of us were dead today,<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,19,195) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,19,195) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,19,195) ><SUP>5</SUP></A> it would be all right with you. 
<a name="2Sa 19:7"></a><span class="versenum">7</span> So get up now and go out and give some encouragement to<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,19,196) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,19,196) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,19,196) ><SUP>6</SUP></A> your servants. For I swear by the <sc>Lord that if you don&#8217;t go out there, not a single man will stay here with you tonight! This disaster will be worse for you than any disaster that has overtaken you from your youth right to the present time!&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Sa 19:8"></a><span class="versenum">8</span> So the king got up and sat at the city gate. When all the people were informed that the king was sitting at the city gate, they<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,19,197) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,19,197) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,19,197) ><SUP>7</SUP></A> all came before him.</p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">David Goes Back to Jerusalem</p><p class="bodytext">But the Israelite soldiers<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,19,198) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,19,198) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,19,198) ><SUP>8</SUP></A> had all fled to their own homes.<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,19,199) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,19,199) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,19,199) ><SUP>9</SUP></A> 
<a name="2Sa 19:9"></a><span class="versenum">9</span> All the people throughout all the tribes of Israel were arguing among themselves saying, &#8220;The king delivered us from the hand of our enemies.

<a name="2Sa 19:10"></a><span class="versenum">10</span> But Absalom, whom we anointed as our king,<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,19,1910) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,19,1910) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,19,1910) ><SUP>10</SUP></A> has died in battle.

<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Sa 19:11"></a><span class="versenum">11</span> Then King David sent a message to Zadok and Abiathar the priests saying, &#8220;Tell the elders of Judah, &#8216;Why should you delay any further in bringing the king back to his palace,<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,19,1912) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,19,1912) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,19,1912) ><SUP>12</SUP></A> when everything Israel is saying has come to the king&#8217;s attention.<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,19,1913) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,19,1913) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,19,1913) ><SUP>13</SUP></A>

Then they sent word to the king saying, &#8220;Return, you and all your servants as well.&#8221; 
<a name="2Sa 19:15"></a><span class="versenum">15</span> So the king returned and came to the Jordan River.<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,19,1918) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,19,1918) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,19,1918) ><SUP>18</SUP></A> </p>

<a name="2Sa 19:16"></a><span class="versenum">16</span> Shimei son of Gera the Benjaminite from Bahurim came down quickly with the men of Judah to meet King David. 
<a name="2Sa 19:17"></a><span class="versenum">17</span> There were a thousand men from Benjamin with him, along with Ziba the servant<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,19,1921) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,19,1921) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,19,1921) ><SUP>21</SUP></A> of Saul&#8217;s household, and with him his fifteen sons and twenty servants.

<a name="2Sa 19:18"></a><span class="versenum">18</span> They crossed at the ford in order to help the king&#8217;s household cross and to do whatever he thought appropriate.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now after he had crossed the Jordan, Shimei son of Gera threw himself down before the king. 
<a name="2Sa 19:19"></a><span class="versenum">19</span> He said to the king, &#8220;Don&#8217;t think badly of me, my lord, and don&#8217;t recall the sin of your servant on the day when you, my lord the king, left<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,19,1923) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,19,1923) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,19,1923) ><SUP>23</SUP></A> Jerusalem!<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,19,1924) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,19,1924) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,19,1924) ><SUP>24</SUP></A> Please don&#8217;t call it to mind!

<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Sa 19:21"></a><span class="versenum">21</span> Abishai son of Zeruiah replied, &#8220;For this should not Shimei be put to death? After all, he cursed the <sc>Lord&#8217;s anointed!&#8221; 
<a name="2Sa 19:22"></a><span class="versenum">22</span> But David said, &#8220;What do we have in common,<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,19,1926) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,19,1926) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,19,1926) ><SUP>26</SUP></A> you sons of Zeruiah?

<a name="2Sa 19:23"></a><span class="versenum">23</span> The king said to Shimei, &#8220;You won&#8217;t die.&#8221; The king vowed an oath<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,19,1927) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,19,1927) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,19,1927) ><SUP>27</SUP></A> concerning this.</p>

<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Sa 19:25"></a><span class="versenum">25</span> When he came from Jerusalem to meet the king, the king asked him, &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you go with me, Mephibosheth?&#8221; 
<a name="2Sa 19:26"></a><span class="versenum">26</span> He replied, &#8220;My lord the king, my servant deceived me!

<a name="2Sa 19:27"></a><span class="versenum">27</span> But my servant<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,19,1935) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,19,1935) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,19,1935) ><SUP>35</SUP></A> has slandered me<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,19,1936) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,19,1936) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,19,1936) ><SUP>36</SUP></A> to my lord the king. But my lord the king is like an angel of God. Do whatever seems appropriate to you. 
<a name="2Sa 19:28"></a><span class="versenum">28</span> After all, there was no one in the entire house of my grandfather<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,19,1937) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,19,1937) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,19,1937) ><SUP>37</SUP></A> who did not deserve death from my lord the king. But instead you allowed me to eat at your own table!<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,19,1938) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,19,1938) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,19,1938) ><SUP>38</SUP></A> What further claim do I have to ask<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,19,1939) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,19,1939) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,19,1939) ><SUP>39</SUP></A> the king for anything?&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Sa 19:29"></a><span class="versenum">29</span> Then the king replied to him, &#8220;Why should you continue speaking like this? You and Ziba will inherit the field together.&#8221; 
<a name="2Sa 19:30"></a><span class="versenum">30</span> Mephibosheth said to the king, &#8220;Let him have<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,19,1940) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,19,1940) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,19,1940) ><SUP>40</SUP></A> the whole thing!

<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Sa 19:31"></a><span class="versenum">31</span> Now when Barzillai the Gileadite had come down from Rogelim, he crossed the Jordan with the king so he could send him on his way from there.<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,19,1942) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,19,1942) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,19,1942) ><SUP>42</SUP></A> 
<a name="2Sa 19:32"></a><span class="versenum">32</span> But Barzillai was very old &#8211; eighty years old, in fact &#8211; and he had taken care of the king when he stayed in Mahanaim, for he was a very rich<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,19,1943) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,19,1943) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,19,1943) ><SUP>43</SUP></A> man. 
<a name="2Sa 19:33"></a><span class="versenum">33</span> So the king said to Barzillai, &#8220;Cross over with me, and I will take care of you while you are with me in Jerusalem.&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Sa 19:34"></a><span class="versenum">34</span> Barzillai replied to the king, &#8220;How many days do I have left to my life, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem? 
<a name="2Sa 19:35"></a><span class="versenum">35</span> I am presently eighty years old. Am I able to discern good and bad?

Am I still able to hear the voices of male and female singers? Why should I<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,19,1945) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,19,1945) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,19,1945) ><SUP>45</SUP></A> continue to be a burden to my lord the king? 
<a name="2Sa 19:36"></a><span class="versenum">36</span> I will cross the Jordan with the king and go a short distance.<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,19,1946) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,19,1946) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,19,1946) ><SUP>46</SUP></A> Why should the king reward me in this way? 
<a name="2Sa 19:37"></a><span class="versenum">37</span> Let me<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,19,1947) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,19,1947) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,19,1947) ><SUP>47</SUP></A> return so that I may die in my own city near the grave of my father and my mother.

<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Sa 19:38"></a><span class="versenum">38</span> The king replied, &#8220;Kimham will cross over with me, and I will do for him whatever I deem appropriate. And whatever you choose, I will do for you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Sa 19:39"></a><span class="versenum">39</span> So all the people crossed the Jordan, as did the king.

<a name="2Sa 19:40"></a><span class="versenum">40</span> When the king crossed over to Gilgal, Kimham<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,19,1949) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,19,1949) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,19,1949) ><SUP>49</SUP></A> crossed over with him. Now all the soldiers<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,19,1950) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,19,1950) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,19,1950) ><SUP>50</SUP></A> of Judah along with half of the soldiers of Israel had helped the king cross over.<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,19,1951) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,19,1951) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,19,1951) ><SUP>51</SUP></A></p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Sa 19:41"></a><span class="versenum">41</span> Then all the men of Israel began coming to the king. They asked the king, &#8220;Why did our brothers, the men of Judah, sneak the king away and help the king and his household cross the Jordan &#8211; and not only him but all of David&#8217;s men as well?&#8221; </p>
<p class="bodytext"> 
<a name="2Sa 19:42"></a><span class="versenum">42</span> All the men of Judah replied to the men of Israel, &#8220;Because the king is our close relative! Why are you so upset about this?
