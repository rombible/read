<a name="2Sa 12:2"></a><span class="versenum">2</span> The rich man had a great many flocks and herds. 
<a name="2Sa 12:3"></a><span class="versenum">3</span> But the poor man had nothing except for a little lamb he had acquired. He raised it, and it grew up alongside him and his children.<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,12,125) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,12,125) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,12,125) ><SUP>5</SUP></A> It used to<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,12,126) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,12,126) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,12,126) ><SUP>6</SUP></A> eat his food,<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,12,127) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,12,127) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,12,127) ><SUP>7</SUP></A> drink from his cup, and sleep in his arms.<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,12,128) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,12,128) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,12,128) ><SUP>8</SUP></A> It was just like a daughter to him.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Sa 12:4"></a><span class="versenum">4</span> &#8220;When a traveler arrived at the rich man&#8217;s home,<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,12,129) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,12,129) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,12,129) ><SUP>9</SUP></A> he did not want to use one of his own sheep or cattle to feed<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,12,1210) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,12,1210) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,12,1210) ><SUP>10</SUP></A> the traveler who had come to visit him.<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,12,1211) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,12,1211) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,12,1211) ><SUP>11</SUP></A> Instead, he took the poor man&#8217;s lamb and cooked<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,12,1212) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,12,1212) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,12,1212) ><SUP>12</SUP></A> it for the man who had come to visit him.&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Sa 12:5"></a><span class="versenum">5</span> Then David became very angry at this man. He said to Nathan, &#8220;As surely as the <sc>Lord lives, the man who did this deserves to die!<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,12,1213) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,12,1213) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,12,1213) ><SUP>13</SUP></A> 
<a name="2Sa 12:6"></a><span class="versenum">6</span> Because he committed this cold-hearted crime, he must pay for the lamb four times over!&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,12,1214) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,12,1214) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,12,1214) ><SUP>14</SUP></A></p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Sa 12:7"></a><span class="versenum">7</span> Nathan said to David, &#8220;You are that man! This is what the <sc>Lord God of Israel says: &#8216;I chose<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,12,1215) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,12,1215) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,12,1215) ><SUP>15</SUP></A> you to be king over Israel and I rescued you from the hand of Saul. 
<a name="2Sa 12:8"></a><span class="versenum">8</span> I gave you your master&#8217;s house, and put your master&#8217;s wives into your arms.<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,12,1216) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,12,1216) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,12,1216) ><SUP>16</SUP></A> I also gave you the house of Israel and Judah. And if all that somehow seems insignificant, I would have given you so much more as well! 
<a name="2Sa 12:9"></a><span class="versenum">9</span> Why have you shown contempt for the word of the <sc>Lord by doing evil in my<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,12,1217) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,12,1217) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,12,1217) ><SUP>17</SUP></A> sight? You have struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword and you have taken his wife as your own!<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,12,1218) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,12,1218) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,12,1218) ><SUP>18</SUP></A> You have killed him with the sword of the Ammonites. 
<a name="2Sa 12:10"></a><span class="versenum">10</span> So now the sword will never depart from your house. For you have despised me by taking the wife of Uriah the Hittite as your own!&#8217; 
<a name="2Sa 12:11"></a><span class="versenum">11</span> This is what the <sc>Lord says: &#8216;I am about to bring disaster on you<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,12,1219) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,12,1219) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,12,1219) ><SUP>19</SUP></A> from inside your own household!<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,12,1220) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,12,1220) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,12,1220) ><SUP>20</SUP></A> Right before your eyes I will take your wives and hand them over to your companion.<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,12,1221) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,12,1221) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,12,1221) ><SUP>21</SUP></A> He will have sexual relations with<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,12,1222) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,12,1222) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,12,1222) ><SUP>22</SUP></A> your wives in broad daylight!<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,12,1223) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,12,1223) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,12,1223) ><SUP>23</SUP></A> 
<a name="2Sa 12:12"></a><span class="versenum">12</span> Although you have acted in secret, I will do this thing before all Israel, and in broad daylight.&#8217;&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,12,1224) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,12,1224) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,12,1224) ><SUP>24</SUP></A></p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Sa 12:13"></a><span class="versenum">13</span> Then David exclaimed to Nathan, &#8220;I have sinned against the <sc>Lord!&#8221; Nathan replied to David, &#8220;Yes, and the <sc>Lord has forgiven<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,12,1225) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,12,1225) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,12,1225) ><SUP>25</SUP></A> your sin. You are not going to die. 
<a name="2Sa 12:14"></a><span class="versenum">14</span> Nonetheless, because you have treated the <sc>Lord with such contempt<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,12,1226) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,12,1226) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,12,1226) ><SUP>26</SUP></A> in this matter, the son who has been born to you will certainly die.&#8221; </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Sa 12:15"></a><span class="versenum">15</span> Then Nathan went to his home. The <sc>Lord struck the child that Uriah&#8217;s wife had borne to David, and the child became very ill.<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,12,1227) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,12,1227) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,12,1227) ><SUP>27</SUP></A> 
<a name="2Sa 12:16"></a><span class="versenum">16</span> Then David prayed to<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,12,1228) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,12,1228) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,12,1228) ><SUP>28</SUP></A> God for the child and fasted.<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,12,1229) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,12,1229) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,12,1229) ><SUP>29</SUP></A> He would even<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,12,1230) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,12,1230) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,12,1230) ><SUP>30</SUP></A> go and spend the night lying on the ground. 
<a name="2Sa 12:17"></a><span class="versenum">17</span> The elders of his house stood over him and tried to lift him from the ground, but he was unwilling, and refused to eat food with them.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Sa 12:18"></a><span class="versenum">18</span> On the seventh day the child died. But the servants of David were afraid to inform him that the child had died, for they said, &#8220;While the child was still alive he would not listen to us<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,12,1231) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,12,1231) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,12,1231) ><SUP>31</SUP></A> when we spoke to him. How can we tell him that the child is dead? He will do himself harm!&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,12,1232) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,12,1232) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,12,1232) ><SUP>32</SUP></A> </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Sa 12:19"></a><span class="versenum">19</span> When David saw that his servants were whispering to one another, he<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,12,1233) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,12,1233) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,12,1233) ><SUP>33</SUP></A> realized that the child was dead. So David asked his servants, &#8220;Is the child dead?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;Yes, he&#8217;s dead.&#8221; 
<a name="2Sa 12:20"></a><span class="versenum">20</span> So David got up from the ground, bathed, put on oil, and changed his clothes. He went to the house of the <sc>Lord and worshiped. Then, when he entered his palace, he requested that food be brought to him, and he ate. </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Sa 12:21"></a><span class="versenum">21</span> His servants said to him, &#8220;What is this that you have done? While<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,12,1234) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,12,1234) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,12,1234) ><SUP>34</SUP></A> the child was still alive, you fasted and wept. Once the child was dead you got up and ate food!&#8221; 
<a name="2Sa 12:22"></a><span class="versenum">22</span> He replied, &#8220;While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept because I thought,<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,12,1235) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,12,1235) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,12,1235) ><SUP>35</SUP></A> &#8216;Perhaps<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,12,1236) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,12,1236) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,12,1236) ><SUP>36</SUP></A> the <sc>Lord will show pity and the child will live. 
<a name="2Sa 12:23"></a><span class="versenum">23</span> But now he is dead. Why should I fast? Am I able to bring him back? I will go to him, but he cannot return to me!&#8217;&#8221; </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Sa 12:24"></a><span class="versenum">24</span> So David comforted his wife Bathsheba. He went to her and had marital relations with her.<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,12,1237) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,12,1237) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,12,1237) ><SUP>37</SUP></A> She gave birth to a son, and David<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,12,1238) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,12,1238) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,12,1238) ><SUP>38</SUP></A> named him Solomon.

<a name="2Sa 12:25"></a><span class="versenum">25</span> and sent word through Nathan the prophet that he should be named Jedidiah<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,12,1240) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,12,1240) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,12,1240) ><SUP>40</SUP></A> for the <sc>Lord&#8217;s sake.</p>

<a name="2Sa 12:27"></a><span class="versenum">27</span> Joab then sent messengers to David, saying, &#8220;I have fought against Rabbah and have captured the water supply of the city.<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,12,1242) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,12,1242) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,12,1242) ><SUP>42</SUP></A>
