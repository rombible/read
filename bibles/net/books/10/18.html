<p class=bodytext><p class="paragraphtitle">The Death of Absalom</p><p class="bodytext"><a name="2Sa 18:1"></a><span class="versenum">1</span> David assembled the army that was with him. He appointed leaders of thousands and leaders of hundreds. 
<a name="2Sa 18:2"></a><span class="versenum">2</span> David then sent out the army &#8211; a third under the leadership of Joab, a third under the leadership of Joab&#8217;s brother Abishai son of Zeruiah, and a third under the leadership of Ittai the Gittite. The king said to the troops, &#8220;I too will indeed march out with you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Sa 18:3"></a><span class="versenum">3</span> But the soldiers replied,<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,18,181) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,18,181) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,18,181) ><SUP>1</SUP></A> &#8220;You should not do this!<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,18,182) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,18,182) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,18,182) ><SUP>2</SUP></A> For if we should have to make a rapid retreat, they won&#8217;t be too concerned about us.<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,18,183) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,18,183) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,18,183) ><SUP>3</SUP></A> Even if half of us should die, they won&#8217;t be too concerned about us.

So it is better if you remain in the city for support.&#8221; 
<a name="2Sa 18:4"></a><span class="versenum">4</span> Then the king said to them, &#8220;I will do whatever seems best to you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">So the king stayed beside the city gate, while all the army marched out by hundreds and by thousands. 
<a name="2Sa 18:5"></a><span class="versenum">5</span> The king gave this order to Joab, Abishai, and Ittai: &#8220;For my sake deal gently with the young man Absalom.&#8221; Now the entire army was listening when the king gave all the leaders this order concerning Absalom.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Sa 18:6"></a><span class="versenum">6</span> Then the army marched out to the field to fight against Israel. The battle took place in the forest of Ephraim. 
<a name="2Sa 18:7"></a><span class="versenum">7</span> The army of Israel was defeated there by David&#8217;s men.<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,18,185) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,18,185) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,18,185) ><SUP>5</SUP></A> The slaughter there was great that day &#8211; 20,000 soldiers were killed. 
<a name="2Sa 18:8"></a><span class="versenum">8</span> The battle there was spread out over the whole area, and the forest consumed more soldiers than the sword devoured that day.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Sa 18:9"></a><span class="versenum">9</span> Then Absalom happened to come across David&#8217;s men. Now as Absalom was riding on his<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,18,186) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,18,186) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,18,186) ><SUP>6</SUP></A> mule, it<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,18,187) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,18,187) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,18,187) ><SUP>7</SUP></A> went under the branches of a large oak tree. His head got caught in the oak and he was suspended in midair,<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,18,188) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,18,188) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,18,188) ><SUP>8</SUP></A> while the mule he had been riding kept going.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Sa 18:10"></a><span class="versenum">10</span> When one<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,18,189) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,18,189) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,18,189) ><SUP>9</SUP></A> of the men saw this, he reported it to Joab saying, &#8220;I saw Absalom hanging in an oak tree.
<a name="2Sa 18:11"></a><span class="versenum">11</span> Joab replied to the man who was telling him this, &#8220;What! You saw this? Why didn&#8217;t you strike him down right on the spot?<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,18,1810) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,18,1810) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,18,1810) ><SUP>10</SUP></A> I would have given you ten pieces of silver<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,18,1811) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,18,1811) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,18,1811) ><SUP>11</SUP></A> and a commemorative belt!&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,18,1812) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,18,1812) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,18,1812) ><SUP>12</SUP></A></p>

In our very presence<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,18,1817) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,18,1817) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,18,1817) ><SUP>17</SUP></A> the king gave this order to you and Abishai and Ittai, &#8216;Protect the young man Absalom for my sake.&#8217;<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,18,1818) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,18,1818) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,18,1818) ><SUP>18</SUP></A> 
<a name="2Sa 18:13"></a><span class="versenum">13</span> If I had acted at risk of my own life<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,18,1819) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,18,1819) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,18,1819) ><SUP>19</SUP></A> &#8211; and nothing is hidden from the king! &#8211; you would have abandoned me.&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,18,1820) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,18,1820) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,18,1820) ><SUP>20</SUP></A></p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Sa 18:14"></a><span class="versenum">14</span> Joab replied, &#8220;I will not wait around like this for you!&#8221; He took three spears in his hand and thrust them into the middle of Absalom while he was still alive in the middle of the oak tree.<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,18,1821) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,18,1821) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,18,1821) ><SUP>21</SUP></A> 
<a name="2Sa 18:15"></a><span class="versenum">15</span> Then ten soldiers who were Joab&#8217;s armor bearers struck Absalom and finished him off.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Sa 18:16"></a><span class="versenum">16</span> Then Joab blew the trumpet<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,18,1822) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,18,1822) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,18,1822) ><SUP>22</SUP></A> and the army turned back from chasing Israel, for Joab had called for the army to halt. 
<a name="2Sa 18:17"></a><span class="versenum">17</span> They took Absalom, threw him into a large pit in the forest, and stacked a huge pile of stones over him. In the meantime all the Israelite soldiers fled to their homes.<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,18,1823) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,18,1823) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,18,1823) ><SUP>23</SUP></A></p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Sa 18:18"></a><span class="versenum">18</span> Prior to this<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,18,1824) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,18,1824) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,18,1824) ><SUP>24</SUP></A> Absalom had set up a monument<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,18,1825) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,18,1825) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,18,1825) ><SUP>25</SUP></A> and dedicated it to himself in the King&#8217;s Valley, reasoning &#8220;I have no son who will carry on my name.&#8221; He named the monument after himself, and to this day it is known as Absalom&#8217;s Memorial.</p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">David Learns of Absalom&#8217;s Death</p><p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Sa 18:19"></a><span class="versenum">19</span> Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, &#8220;Let me run and give the king the good news that the <sc>Lord has vindicated him before his enemies.&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,18,1826) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,18,1826) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,18,1826) ><SUP>26</SUP></A> 
<a name="2Sa 18:20"></a><span class="versenum">20</span> But Joab said to him, &#8220;You will not be a bearer of good news today. You will bear good news some other day, but not today,<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,18,1827) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,18,1827) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,18,1827) ><SUP>27</SUP></A> for the king&#8217;s son is dead.&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Sa 18:21"></a><span class="versenum">21</span> Then Joab said to the Cushite, &#8220;Go and tell the king what you have seen.&#8221; After bowing to Joab, the Cushite ran off. 
<a name="2Sa 18:22"></a><span class="versenum">22</span> Ahimaaz the son of Zadok again spoke to Joab, &#8220;Whatever happens, let me go after the Cushite.&#8221; But Joab said, &#8220;Why is it that you want to go, my son? You have no good news that will bring you a reward.&#8221; 
<a name="2Sa 18:23"></a><span class="versenum">23</span> But he said,<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,18,1828) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,18,1828) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,18,1828) ><SUP>28</SUP></A> &#8220;Whatever happens, I want to go!&#8221; So Joab<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,18,1829) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,18,1829) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,18,1829) ><SUP>29</SUP></A> said to him, &#8220;Then go!&#8221; So Ahimaaz ran by the way of the Jordan plain, and he passed the Cushite.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Sa 18:24"></a><span class="versenum">24</span> Now David was sitting between the inner and outer gates,<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,18,1830) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,18,1830) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,18,1830) ><SUP>30</SUP></A> and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate at the wall. When he looked, he saw a man running by himself. 
<a name="2Sa 18:25"></a><span class="versenum">25</span> So the watchman called out and informed the king. The king said, &#8220;If he is by himself, he brings good news.&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,18,1831) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,18,1831) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,18,1831) ><SUP>31</SUP></A> The runner<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,18,1832) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,18,1832) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,18,1832) ><SUP>32</SUP></A> came ever closer.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Sa 18:26"></a><span class="versenum">26</span> Then the watchman saw another man running. The watchman called out to the gatekeeper, &#8220;There is another man running by himself.&#8221; The king said, &#8220;This one also is bringing good news.&#8221; 
<a name="2Sa 18:27"></a><span class="versenum">27</span> The watchman said, &#8220;It appears to me that the first runner is Ahimaaz<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,18,1833) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,18,1833) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,18,1833) ><SUP>33</SUP></A> son of Zadok.&#8221; The king said, &#8220;He is a good man, and he comes with good news.&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Sa 18:28"></a><span class="versenum">28</span> Then Ahimaaz called out and said to the king, &#8220;Greetings!&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,18,1834) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,18,1834) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,18,1834) ><SUP>34</SUP></A> He bowed down before the king with his face toward the ground and said, &#8220;May the <sc>Lord your God be praised because he has defeated<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,18,1835) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,18,1835) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,18,1835) ><SUP>35</SUP></A> the men who opposed<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,18,1836) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,18,1836) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,18,1836) ><SUP>36</SUP></A> my lord the king!&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Sa 18:29"></a><span class="versenum">29</span> The king replied, &#8220;How is the young man Absalom?&#8221; Ahimaaz replied, &#8220;I saw a great deal of confusion when Joab was sending the king&#8217;s servant and me, your servant, but I don&#8217;t know what it was all about.&#8221; 
<a name="2Sa 18:30"></a><span class="versenum">30</span> The king said, &#8220;Turn aside and take your place here.&#8221; So he turned aside and waited. </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Sa 18:31"></a><span class="versenum">31</span> Then the Cushite arrived and said,<a onclick=vOpenNote(10,18,1837) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,10,18,1837) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,10,18,1837) ><SUP>37</SUP></A> &#8220;May my lord the king now receive the good news!
