<p class=bodytext><p class="paragraphtitle">David Goes to Nob</p><p class="bodytext"><b>(21:1)</b><a onclick=vOpenNote(9,21,211) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,21,211) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,21,211) ><SUP>1</SUP></A> Then David<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,21,212) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,21,212) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,21,212) ><SUP>2</SUP></A> got up and left, while Jonathan went back to the city. <a name="1Sa 21:1"></a><span class="versenum">1</span> <b>(21:2)</b> David went to Ahimelech the priest in Nob. Ahimelech was shaking with fear when he met<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,21,213) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,21,213) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,21,213) ><SUP>3</SUP></A> David, and said to him, &#8220;Why are you by yourself with no one accompanying you?&#8221; 
<a name="1Sa 21:2"></a><span class="versenum">2</span> David replied to Ahimelech the priest, &#8220;The king instructed me to do something, but he said to me, &#8216;Don&#8217;t let anyone know the reason I am sending you or the instructions I have given you.&#8217;<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,21,214) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,21,214) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,21,214) ><SUP>4</SUP></A> I have told my soldiers<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,21,215) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,21,215) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,21,215) ><SUP>5</SUP></A> to wait at a certain place.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,21,216) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,21,216) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,21,216) ><SUP>6</SUP></A> 
<a name="1Sa 21:3"></a><span class="versenum">3</span> Now what do you have at your disposal?<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,21,217) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,21,217) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,21,217) ><SUP>7</SUP></A> Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever can be found.&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 21:4"></a><span class="versenum">4</span> The priest replied to David, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have any ordinary bread at my disposal. Only holy bread is available, and then only if your soldiers<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,21,218) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,21,218) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,21,218) ><SUP>8</SUP></A> have abstained from sexual relations with women.&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,21,219) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,21,219) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,21,219) ><SUP>9</SUP></A> 
<a name="1Sa 21:5"></a><span class="versenum">5</span> David said to the priest, &#8220;Certainly women have been kept away from us, just as on previous occasions when I have set out. The soldiers&#8217;<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,21,2110) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,21,2110) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,21,2110) ><SUP>10</SUP></A> equipment is holy, even on an ordinary journey. How much more so will they be holy today, along with their equipment!&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 21:6"></a><span class="versenum">6</span> So the priest gave him holy bread, for there was no bread there other than the bread of the Presence. It had been removed from before the <sc>Lord in order to replace it with hot bread on the day it had been taken away. 
<a name="1Sa 21:7"></a><span class="versenum">7</span> (One of Saul&#8217;s servants was there that day, detained before the <sc>Lord. His name was Doeg the Edomite, who was in charge of Saul&#8217;s shepherds.) 
<a name="1Sa 21:8"></a><span class="versenum">8</span> David said to Ahimelech, &#8220;Is there no sword or spear here at your disposal? I don&#8217;t have my own sword or equipment in hand due to the urgency of the king&#8217;s instructions.&#8221;</p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">David Goes to Gath</p><p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 21:9"></a><span class="versenum">9</span> The priest replied, &#8220;The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you struck down in the valley of Elah, is wrapped in a garment behind the ephod. If you wish, take it for yourself. Other than that, there&#8217;s nothing here.&#8221; David said, &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing like it! Give it to me!&#8221; 
<a name="1Sa 21:10"></a><span class="versenum">10</span> So on that day David arose and fled from Saul. He went to King Achish of Gath. 
<a name="1Sa 21:11"></a><span class="versenum">11</span> The servants of Achish said to him, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t this David, the king of the land? Isn&#8217;t he the one that they sing about when they dance, saying,</p>
<p class="poetry">&#8216;Saul struck down his thousands,</p>
<p class="poetry">But David his tens of thousands&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 21:12"></a><span class="versenum">12</span> David thought about what they said<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,21,2111) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,21,2111) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,21,2111) ><SUP>11</SUP></A> and was very afraid of King Achish of Gath. 
<a name="1Sa 21:13"></a><span class="versenum">13</span> He altered his behavior in their presence.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,21,2112) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,21,2112) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,21,2112) ><SUP>12</SUP></A> Since he was in their power,<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,21,2113) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,21,2113) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,21,2113) ><SUP>13</SUP></A> he pretended to be insane, making marks on the doors of the gate and letting his saliva run down his beard.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 21:14"></a><span class="versenum">14</span> Achish said to his servants, &#8220;Look at this madman! Why did you bring him to me? 
<a name="1Sa 21:15"></a><span class="versenum">15</span> Do I have a shortage of fools, that you have brought me this man to display his insanity in front of me? Should this man enter my house?&#8221;</p>
