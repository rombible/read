<a name="1Sa 17:13"></a><span class="versenum">13</span> Jesse&#8217;s three oldest sons had followed Saul to war.

<a name="1Sa 17:14"></a><span class="versenum">14</span> Now David was the youngest. While the three oldest sons followed Saul, 
<a name="1Sa 17:15"></a><span class="versenum">15</span> David was going back and forth<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,17,1722) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,17,1722) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,17,1722) ><SUP>22</SUP></A> from Saul in order to care for his father&#8217;s sheep in Bethlehem. </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 17:16"></a><span class="versenum">16</span> Meanwhile for forty days the Philistine approached every morning and evening and took his position. 
<a name="1Sa 17:17"></a><span class="versenum">17</span> Jesse said to his son David, &#8220;Take your brothers this ephah of roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread; go quickly<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,17,1723) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,17,1723) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,17,1723) ><SUP>23</SUP></A> to the camp to your brothers.

<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 17:20"></a><span class="versenum">20</span> So David got up early in the morning and entrusted the flock to someone else who would watch over it.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,17,1728) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,17,1728) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,17,1728) ><SUP>28</SUP></A> After loading up, he went just as Jesse had instructed him.

<a name="1Sa 17:21"></a><span class="versenum">21</span> Israel and the Philistines drew up their battle lines opposite one another. 
<a name="1Sa 17:22"></a><span class="versenum">22</span> After David had entrusted his cargo to the care of the supply officer,<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,17,1730) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,17,1730) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,17,1730) ><SUP>30</SUP></A> he ran to the battlefront. When he arrived, he asked his brothers how they were doing. 
<a name="1Sa 17:23"></a><span class="versenum">23</span> As he was speaking with them, the champion named Goliath, the Philistine from Gath, was coming up from the battle lines of the Philistines.

<a name="1Sa 17:24"></a><span class="versenum">24</span> When all the men of Israel saw this man, they retreated<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,17,1732) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,17,1732) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,17,1732) ><SUP>32</SUP></A> from his presence and were very afraid. </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 17:25"></a><span class="versenum">25</span> The men of Israel said, &#8220;Have you seen this man who is coming up?

<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 17:26"></a><span class="versenum">26</span> David asked the men who were standing near him, &#8220;What will be done for the man who strikes down this Philistine and frees Israel from this humiliation?<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,17,1734) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,17,1734) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,17,1734) ><SUP>34</SUP></A> For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he defies the armies of the living God?&#8221;

<a name="1Sa 17:29"></a><span class="versenum">29</span> David replied, &#8220;What have I done now? Can&#8217;t I say anything?&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,17,1740) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,17,1740) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,17,1740) ><SUP>40</SUP></A> 
<a name="1Sa 17:30"></a><span class="versenum">30</span> Then he turned from those who were nearby to someone else and asked the same question,<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,17,1741) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,17,1741) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,17,1741) ><SUP>41</SUP></A> but they<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,17,1742) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,17,1742) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,17,1742) ><SUP>42</SUP></A> gave him the same answer as before. 
<a name="1Sa 17:31"></a><span class="versenum">31</span> When David&#8217;s words were overheard and reported to Saul, he called for him.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,17,1743) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,17,1743) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,17,1743) ><SUP>43</SUP></A></p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 17:32"></a><span class="versenum">32</span> David said to Saul, &#8220;Don&#8217;t let anyone be discouraged.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,17,1744) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,17,1744) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,17,1744) ><SUP>44</SUP></A> Your servant will go and fight this Philistine!&#8221;

<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 17:34"></a><span class="versenum">34</span> David replied to Saul, &#8220;Your servant has been a shepherd for his father&#8217;s flock. Whenever a lion or bear would come and carry off a sheep from the flock, 
<a name="1Sa 17:35"></a><span class="versenum">35</span> I would go out after it, strike it down, and rescue the sheep from its mouth. If it rose up against me, I would grab it by its jaw, strike it, and kill it. 
<a name="1Sa 17:36"></a><span class="versenum">36</span> Your servant has struck down both the lion and the bear. This uncircumcised Philistine will be just like one of them.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,17,1745) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,17,1745) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,17,1745) ><SUP>45</SUP></A> For he has defied the armies of the living God!&#8221; 
<a name="1Sa 17:37"></a><span class="versenum">37</span> David went on to say, &#8220;The <sc>Lord who delivered me from the lion and the bear will also deliver me from the hand of this Philistine!&#8221; Then Saul said to David, &#8220;Go! The <sc>Lord will be with you.&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,17,1746) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,17,1746) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,17,1746) ><SUP>46</SUP></A></p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 17:38"></a><span class="versenum">38</span> Then Saul clothed David with his own fighting attire and put a bronze helmet on his head. He also put body armor on him. 
<a name="1Sa 17:39"></a><span class="versenum">39</span> David strapped on his sword over his fighting attire and tried to walk around, but he was not used to them.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,17,1747) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,17,1747) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,17,1747) ><SUP>47</SUP></A> David said to Saul, &#8220;I can&#8217;t walk in these things, for I&#8217;m not used to them.&#8221; So David removed them. 
<a name="1Sa 17:40"></a><span class="versenum">40</span> He took his staff in his hand, picked out five smooth stones from the stream, placed them in the pouch<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,17,1748) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,17,1748) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,17,1748) ><SUP>48</SUP></A> of his shepherd&#8217;s bag, took his sling in hand, and approached the Philistine.</p>

<a name="1Sa 17:42"></a><span class="versenum">42</span> When the Philistine looked carefully at David, he despised him, for he was only a ruddy and handsome boy. 
<a name="1Sa 17:43"></a><span class="versenum">43</span> The Philistine said to David, &#8220;Am I a dog, that you are coming after me with sticks?&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,17,1750) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,17,1750) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,17,1750) ><SUP>50</SUP></A> Then the Philistine cursed David by his gods.

<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 17:45"></a><span class="versenum">45</span> But David replied to the Philistine, &#8220;You are coming against me with sword and spear and javelin. But I am coming against you in the name of the <sc>Lord of hosts, the God of Israel&#8217;s armies, whom you have defied! 
<a name="1Sa 17:46"></a><span class="versenum">46</span> This very day the <sc>Lord will deliver you into my hand! I will strike you down and cut off your head.

<a name="1Sa 17:47"></a><span class="versenum">47</span> and all this assembly will know that it is not by sword or spear that the <sc>Lord saves! For the battle is the <sc>Lord&#8217;s, and he will deliver you into our hand.&#8221; </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 17:48"></a><span class="versenum">48</span> The Philistine drew steadily closer to David to attack him, while David quickly ran toward the battle line to attack the Philistine.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,17,1752) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,17,1752) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,17,1752) ><SUP>52</SUP></A> 
<a name="1Sa 17:49"></a><span class="versenum">49</span> David reached his hand into the bag and took out a stone. He slung it, striking the Philistine on the forehead. The stone sank deeply into his forehead, and he fell down with his face to the ground. </p>
