<p class=bodytext><p class="paragraphtitle">David Defeats the Amalekites</p><p class="bodytext"><a name="1Sa 30:1"></a><span class="versenum">1</span> On the third day David and his men came to Ziklag. Now the Amalekites had raided the Negev and Ziklag. They attacked Ziklag and burned it.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,30,301) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,30,301) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,30,301) ><SUP>1</SUP></A> 
<a name="1Sa 30:2"></a><span class="versenum">2</span> They took captive the women who were in it, from the youngest to the oldest, but they did not kill anyone. They simply carried them off and went on their way. </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 30:3"></a><span class="versenum">3</span> When David and his men came to the city, they found it burned.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,30,302) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,30,302) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,30,302) ><SUP>2</SUP></A> Their wives, sons, and daughters had been taken captive. 
<a name="1Sa 30:4"></a><span class="versenum">4</span> Then David and the men<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,30,303) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,30,303) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,30,303) ><SUP>3</SUP></A> who were with him wept loudly<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,30,304) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,30,304) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,30,304) ><SUP>4</SUP></A> until they could weep no more.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,30,305) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,30,305) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,30,305) ><SUP>5</SUP></A> 
<a name="1Sa 30:5"></a><span class="versenum">5</span> David&#8217;s two wives had been taken captive &#8211; Ahinoam the Jezreelite and Abigail the Carmelite, Nabal&#8217;s widow. 
<a name="1Sa 30:6"></a><span class="versenum">6</span> David was very upset, for the men<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,30,306) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,30,306) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,30,306) ><SUP>6</SUP></A> were thinking of stoning him;<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,30,307) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,30,307) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,30,307) ><SUP>7</SUP></A> each man grieved bitterly<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,30,308) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,30,308) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,30,308) ><SUP>8</SUP></A> over his sons and daughters. But David drew strength from the <sc>Lord his God.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 30:7"></a><span class="versenum">7</span> Then David said to the priest Abiathar son of Ahimelech, &#8220;Bring me the ephod.&#8221; So Abiathar brought the ephod to David. 
<a name="1Sa 30:8"></a><span class="versenum">8</span> David inquired of the <sc>Lord, saying, &#8220;Should I pursue this raiding band? Will I overtake them?&#8221; He said to him, &#8220;Pursue, for you will certainly overtake them and carry out a rescue!&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 30:9"></a><span class="versenum">9</span> So David went, accompanied by his six hundred men. When he came to the Wadi Besor, those who were in the rear stayed there.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,30,309) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,30,309) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,30,309) ><SUP>9</SUP></A> 
<a name="1Sa 30:10"></a><span class="versenum">10</span> David and four hundred men continued the pursuit, but two hundred men who were too exhausted to cross the Wadi Besor stayed there. </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 30:11"></a><span class="versenum">11</span> Then they found an Egyptian in the field and brought him to David. They gave him bread to eat and water to drink. 
<a name="1Sa 30:12"></a><span class="versenum">12</span> They gave him a slice of pressed figs and two bunches of raisins to eat. This greatly refreshed him,<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,30,3010) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,30,3010) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,30,3010) ><SUP>10</SUP></A> for he had not eaten food or drunk water for three days and three nights. 
<a name="1Sa 30:13"></a><span class="versenum">13</span> David said to him, &#8220;To whom do you belong, and where are you from?&#8221; The young man said, &#8220;I am an Egyptian, the servant of an Amalekite man. My master abandoned me when I was ill for three days. 
<a name="1Sa 30:14"></a><span class="versenum">14</span> We conducted a raid on the Negev of the Kerethites, on the area of Judah, and on the Negev of Caleb. We burned Ziklag.&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,30,3011) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,30,3011) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,30,3011) ><SUP>11</SUP></A> 
<a name="1Sa 30:15"></a><span class="versenum">15</span> David said to him, &#8220;Can you take us down to this raiding party?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Swear to me by God that you will not kill me or hand me over to my master, and I will take you down to this raiding party.&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 30:16"></a><span class="versenum">16</span> So he took David<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,30,3012) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,30,3012) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,30,3012) ><SUP>12</SUP></A> down, and they found them spread out over the land. They were eating and drinking and enjoying themselves because of all the loot<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,30,3013) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,30,3013) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,30,3013) ><SUP>13</SUP></A> they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah. 
<a name="1Sa 30:17"></a><span class="versenum">17</span> But David struck them down from twilight until the following evening. None of them escaped, with the exception of four hundred young men who got away on camels.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,30,3014) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,30,3014) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,30,3014) ><SUP>14</SUP></A> 
<a name="1Sa 30:18"></a><span class="versenum">18</span> David retrieved everything the Amalekites had taken; he<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,30,3015) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,30,3015) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,30,3015) ><SUP>15</SUP></A> also rescued his two wives. 
<a name="1Sa 30:19"></a><span class="versenum">19</span> There was nothing missing, whether small or great. He retrieved sons and daughters, the plunder, and everything else they had taken.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,30,3016) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,30,3016) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,30,3016) ><SUP>16</SUP></A> David brought everything back. 
<a name="1Sa 30:20"></a><span class="versenum">20</span> David took all the flocks and herds and drove them in front of the rest of the animals. People were saying, &#8220;This is David&#8217;s plunder!&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 30:21"></a><span class="versenum">21</span> Then David approached the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to go with him,<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,30,3017) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,30,3017) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,30,3017) ><SUP>17</SUP></A> those whom they had left at the Wadi Besor. They went out to meet David and the people who were with him. When David approached the people, he asked how they were doing. 
<a name="1Sa 30:22"></a><span class="versenum">22</span> But all the evil and worthless men among those who had gone with David said, &#8220;Since they didn&#8217;t go with us,<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,30,3018) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,30,3018) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,30,3018) ><SUP>18</SUP></A> we won&#8217;t give them any of the loot we retrieved! They may take only their wives and children. Let them lead them away and be gone!&#8221; </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 30:23"></a><span class="versenum">23</span> But David said, &#8220;No! You shouldn&#8217;t do this, my brothers. Look at what the <sc>Lord has given us!<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,30,3019) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,30,3019) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,30,3019) ><SUP>19</SUP></A> He has protected us and has delivered into our hands the raiding party that came against us. 
<a name="1Sa 30:24"></a><span class="versenum">24</span> Who will listen to you in this matter? The portion of the one who went down into the battle will be the same as the portion of the one who remained with the equipment! Let their portions be the same!&#8221; </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 30:25"></a><span class="versenum">25</span> From that time onward it was a binding ordinance<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,30,3020) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,30,3020) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,30,3020) ><SUP>20</SUP></A> for Israel, right up to the present time. </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 30:26"></a><span class="versenum">26</span> When David came to Ziklag, he sent some of the plunder to the elders of Judah who were his friends, saying, &#8220;Here&#8217;s a gift<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,30,3021) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,30,3021) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,30,3021) ><SUP>21</SUP></A> for you from the looting of the <sc>Lord&#8217;s enemies!&#8221; 
<a name="1Sa 30:27"></a><span class="versenum">27</span> The gift was for those in the following locations:<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,30,3022) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,30,3022) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,30,3022) ><SUP>22</SUP></A> for those in Bethel,<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,30,3023) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,30,3023) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,30,3023) ><SUP>23</SUP></A> Ramoth Negev, and Jattir; 
<a name="1Sa 30:28"></a><span class="versenum">28</span> for those in Aroer, Siphmoth, Eshtemoa, 
<a name="1Sa 30:29"></a><span class="versenum">29</span> and Racal; for those in the cities of the Jerahmeelites and Kenites; 
<a name="1Sa 30:30"></a><span class="versenum">30</span> for those in Hormah, Bor Ashan, Athach, 
<a name="1Sa 30:31"></a><span class="versenum">31</span> and Hebron; and for those in whatever other places David and his men had traveled. </p>
