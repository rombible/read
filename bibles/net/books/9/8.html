<p class=bodytext><p class="paragraphtitle">Israel Seeks a King</p><p class="bodytext"><a name="1Sa 8:1"></a><span class="versenum">1</span> In his old age Samuel appointed his sons as judges over Israel. 
<a name="1Sa 8:2"></a><span class="versenum">2</span> The name of his firstborn son was Joel, and the name of his second son was Abijah. They were judges in Beer Sheba. 
<a name="1Sa 8:3"></a><span class="versenum">3</span> But his sons did not follow<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,8,81) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,8,81) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,8,81) ><SUP>1</SUP></A> his ways. Instead, they made money dishonestly, accepted bribes, and perverted justice.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,8,82) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,8,82) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,8,82) ><SUP>2</SUP></A></p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 8:4"></a><span class="versenum">4</span> So all the elders of Israel gathered together and approached Samuel at Ramah. 
<a name="1Sa 8:5"></a><span class="versenum">5</span> They said to him, &#8220;Look, you are old, and your sons don&#8217;t follow your ways. So now appoint over us a king to lead<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,8,83) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,8,83) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,8,83) ><SUP>3</SUP></A> us, just like all the other nations have.&#8221; </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 8:6"></a><span class="versenum">6</span> But this request displeased Samuel, for<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,8,84) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,8,84) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,8,84) ><SUP>4</SUP></A> they said, &#8220;Give us a king to lead us.&#8221; So Samuel prayed to the <sc>Lord. 
<a name="1Sa 8:7"></a><span class="versenum">7</span> The <sc>Lord said to Samuel, &#8220;Do everything the people request of you.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,8,85) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,8,85) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,8,85) ><SUP>5</SUP></A> For it is not you that they have rejected, but it is me that they have rejected as their king. 
<a name="1Sa 8:8"></a><span class="versenum">8</span> Just as they have done<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,8,86) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,8,86) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,8,86) ><SUP>6</SUP></A> from the day that I brought them up from Egypt until this very day, they have rejected me and have served other gods. This is what they are also doing to you. 
<a name="1Sa 8:9"></a><span class="versenum">9</span> So now do as they say.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,8,87) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,8,87) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,8,87) ><SUP>7</SUP></A> But seriously warn<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,8,88) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,8,88) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,8,88) ><SUP>8</SUP></A> them and make them aware of the policies of the king who will rule over them.&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,8,89) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,8,89) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,8,89) ><SUP>9</SUP></A> </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 8:10"></a><span class="versenum">10</span> So Samuel spoke all the words of the <sc>Lord to the people who were asking him for a king. 
<a name="1Sa 8:11"></a><span class="versenum">11</span> He said, &#8220;Here are the policies of the king who will rule over you: He will conscript your sons and put them in his chariot forces and in his cavalry; they will run in front of his chariot. 
<a name="1Sa 8:12"></a><span class="versenum">12</span> He will appoint for himself leaders of thousands and leaders of fifties,<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,8,810) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,8,810) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,8,810) ><SUP>10</SUP></A> as well as those who plow his ground, reap his harvest, and make his weapons of war and his chariot equipment. 
<a name="1Sa 8:13"></a><span class="versenum">13</span> He will take your daughters to be ointment makers, cooks, and bakers. 
<a name="1Sa 8:14"></a><span class="versenum">14</span> He will take your best fields and vineyards and give them to his own servants. 
<a name="1Sa 8:15"></a><span class="versenum">15</span> He will demand a tenth of your seed and of the produce of your vineyards and give it to his administrators<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,8,811) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,8,811) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,8,811) ><SUP>11</SUP></A> and his servants. 
<a name="1Sa 8:16"></a><span class="versenum">16</span> He will take your male and female servants, as well as your best cattle and your donkeys, and assign them for his own use. 
<a name="1Sa 8:17"></a><span class="versenum">17</span> He will demand a tenth of your flocks, and you yourselves will be his servants. 
<a name="1Sa 8:18"></a><span class="versenum">18</span> In that day you will cry out because of your king whom you have chosen for yourselves, but the <sc>Lord won&#8217;t answer you in that day.&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,8,812) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,8,812) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,8,812) ><SUP>12</SUP></A> </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 8:19"></a><span class="versenum">19</span> But the people refused to heed Samuel&#8217;s warning.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,8,813) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,8,813) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,8,813) ><SUP>13</SUP></A> Instead they said, &#8220;No! There will be a king over us! 
<a name="1Sa 8:20"></a><span class="versenum">20</span> We will be like all the other nations. Our king will judge us and lead us<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,8,814) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,8,814) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,8,814) ><SUP>14</SUP></A> and fight our battles.&#8221; </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 8:21"></a><span class="versenum">21</span> So Samuel listened to everything the people said and then reported it to the <sc>Lord.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,8,815) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,8,815) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,8,815) ><SUP>15</SUP></A> 
<a name="1Sa 8:22"></a><span class="versenum">22</span> The <sc>Lord said to Samuel, &#8220;Do as they say<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,8,816) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,8,816) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,8,816) ><SUP>16</SUP></A> and install a king over them.&#8221; Then Samuel said to the men of Israel, &#8220;Each of you go back to his own city.&#8221;</p>
