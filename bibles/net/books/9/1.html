<p class=bodytext><p class="paragraphtitle">Hannah Gives Birth to Samuel</p><p class="bodytext"><a name="1Sa 1:1"></a><span class="versenum">1</span> There was a man from Ramathaim Zophim,<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,1,11) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,1,11) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,1,11) ><SUP>1</SUP></A> from the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Elkanah. He was the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite. 
<a name="1Sa 1:2"></a><span class="versenum">2</span> He had two wives; the name of the first was Hannah and the name of the second was Peninnah. Now Peninnah had children, but Hannah was childless. </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 1:3"></a><span class="versenum">3</span> Year after year<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,1,12) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,1,12) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,1,12) ><SUP>2</SUP></A> this man would go up from his city to worship and to sacrifice to the <sc>Lord of hosts at Shiloh. It was there that the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phineas, served as the <sc>Lord&#8217;s priests. 
<a name="1Sa 1:4"></a><span class="versenum">4</span> Whenever the day came for Elkanah to sacrifice, he used to give meat portions to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters. 
<a name="1Sa 1:5"></a><span class="versenum">5</span> But he would give a double<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,1,13) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,1,13) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,1,13) ><SUP>3</SUP></A> portion to Hannah, because he especially loved her.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,1,14) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,1,14) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,1,14) ><SUP>4</SUP></A> Now the <sc>Lord had not enabled her to have children.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,1,15) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,1,15) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,1,15) ><SUP>5</SUP></A> 
<a name="1Sa 1:6"></a><span class="versenum">6</span> Her rival wife used to upset her and make her worry,<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,1,16) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,1,16) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,1,16) ><SUP>6</SUP></A> for the <sc>Lord had not enabled her to have children. 
<a name="1Sa 1:7"></a><span class="versenum">7</span> Peninnah<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,1,17) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,1,17) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,1,17) ><SUP>7</SUP></A> would behave this way year after year. Whenever Hannah<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,1,18) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,1,18) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,1,18) ><SUP>8</SUP></A> went up to the <sc>Lord&#8217;s house, Peninnah<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,1,19) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,1,19) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,1,19) ><SUP>9</SUP></A> would upset her so that she would weep and refuse to eat. 
<a name="1Sa 1:8"></a><span class="versenum">8</span> Finally her husband Elkanah said to her, &#8220;Hannah, why do you weep and not eat? Why are you so sad?<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,1,110) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,1,110) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,1,110) ><SUP>10</SUP></A> Am I not better to you than ten<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,1,111) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,1,111) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,1,111) ><SUP>11</SUP></A> sons?&#8221; </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 1:9"></a><span class="versenum">9</span> On one occasion in Shiloh, after they had finished eating and drinking, Hannah got up.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,1,112) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,1,112) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,1,112) ><SUP>12</SUP></A> (Now at the time Eli the priest was sitting in his chair<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,1,113) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,1,113) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,1,113) ><SUP>13</SUP></A> by the doorpost of the <sc>Lord&#8217;s temple.) 
<a name="1Sa 1:10"></a><span class="versenum">10</span> She was very upset<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,1,114) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,1,114) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,1,114) ><SUP>14</SUP></A> as she prayed to the <sc>Lord, and she was weeping uncontrollably.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,1,115) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,1,115) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,1,115) ><SUP>15</SUP></A> 
<a name="1Sa 1:11"></a><span class="versenum">11</span> She made a vow saying, &#8220;O <sc>Lord of hosts, if you will look with compassion<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,1,116) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,1,116) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,1,116) ><SUP>16</SUP></A> on the suffering of your female servant,<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,1,117) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,1,117) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,1,117) ><SUP>17</SUP></A> remembering me and not forgetting your servant, and give a male child<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,1,118) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,1,118) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,1,118) ><SUP>18</SUP></A> to your servant, then I will dedicate him to the <sc>Lord all the days of his life. His hair will never be cut.&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,1,119) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,1,119) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,1,119) ><SUP>19</SUP></A> </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 1:12"></a><span class="versenum">12</span> As she continued praying to<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,1,120) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,1,120) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,1,120) ><SUP>20</SUP></A> the <sc>Lord, Eli was watching her mouth. 
<a name="1Sa 1:13"></a><span class="versenum">13</span> Now Hannah was speaking from her heart. Although her lips were moving, her voice was inaudible. Eli therefore thought she was drunk. 
<a name="1Sa 1:14"></a><span class="versenum">14</span> So he<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,1,121) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,1,121) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,1,121) ><SUP>21</SUP></A> said to her, &#8220;How often do you intend to get drunk? Put away your wine!&#8221; </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 1:15"></a><span class="versenum">15</span> But Hannah replied, &#8220;That&#8217;s not the way it is,<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,1,122) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,1,122) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,1,122) ><SUP>22</SUP></A> my lord! I am under a great deal of stress.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,1,123) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,1,123) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,1,123) ><SUP>23</SUP></A> I have drunk neither wine nor beer. Rather, I have poured out my soul to<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,1,124) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,1,124) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,1,124) ><SUP>24</SUP></A> the <sc>Lord. 
<a name="1Sa 1:16"></a><span class="versenum">16</span> Don&#8217;t consider your servant a wicked woman,<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,1,125) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,1,125) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,1,125) ><SUP>25</SUP></A> for until now I have spoken from my deep pain and anguish.&#8221; </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 1:17"></a><span class="versenum">17</span> Eli replied, &#8220;Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant the request that you have asked of him.&#8221; 
<a name="1Sa 1:18"></a><span class="versenum">18</span> She said, &#8220;May I, your servant, find favor in your sight.&#8221; So the woman went her way and got something to eat.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,1,126) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,1,126) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,1,126) ><SUP>26</SUP></A> Her face no longer looked sad.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 1:19"></a><span class="versenum">19</span> They got up early the next morning and after worshiping the <sc>Lord, they returned to their home at Ramah. Elkanah had marital relations with<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,1,127) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,1,127) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,1,127) ><SUP>27</SUP></A> his wife Hannah, and the <sc>Lord remembered<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,1,128) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,1,128) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,1,128) ><SUP>28</SUP></A> her. 
<a name="1Sa 1:20"></a><span class="versenum">20</span> After some time Hannah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel, thinking, &#8220;I asked the <sc>Lord for him.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,1,129) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,1,129) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,1,129) ><SUP>29</SUP></A></p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Hannah Dedicates Samuel to the Lord</p><p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 1:21"></a><span class="versenum">21</span> This man Elkanah went up with all his family to make the yearly sacrifice to the <sc>Lord and to keep his vow, 
<a name="1Sa 1:22"></a><span class="versenum">22</span> but Hannah did not go up with them.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,1,130) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,1,130) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,1,130) ><SUP>30</SUP></A> Instead she told her husband, &#8220;Once the boy is weaned, I will bring him and appear before the <sc>Lord, and he will remain there from then on.&#8221; </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 1:23"></a><span class="versenum">23</span> So her husband Elkanah said to her, &#8220;Do what you think best.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,1,131) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,1,131) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,1,131) ><SUP>31</SUP></A> Stay until you have weaned him. May the <sc>Lord fulfill his promise.&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,1,132) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,1,132) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,1,132) ><SUP>32</SUP></A></p>
<p class="bodytext">So the woman stayed and nursed her son until she had weaned him. 
<a name="1Sa 1:24"></a><span class="versenum">24</span> Once she had weaned him, she took him up with her, along with three bulls, an ephah<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,1,133) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,1,133) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,1,133) ><SUP>33</SUP></A> of flour, and a container<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,1,134) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,1,134) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,1,134) ><SUP>34</SUP></A> of wine. She brought him to the <sc>Lord&#8217;s house at Shiloh, even though he was young.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,1,135) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,1,135) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,1,135) ><SUP>35</SUP></A> 
<a name="1Sa 1:25"></a><span class="versenum">25</span> Once the bull had been slaughtered, they brought the boy to Eli. 
<a name="1Sa 1:26"></a><span class="versenum">26</span> She said, &#8220;Just as surely as you are alive, my lord, I am the woman who previously stood here with you in order to pray to the <sc>Lord. 
<a name="1Sa 1:27"></a><span class="versenum">27</span> I prayed for this boy, and the <sc>Lord has given me the request that I asked of him. 
<a name="1Sa 1:28"></a><span class="versenum">28</span> Now I dedicate him to the <sc>Lord. From this time on he is dedicated to the <sc>Lord.&#8221; Then they<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,1,136) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,1,136) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,1,136) ><SUP>36</SUP></A> worshiped the <sc>Lord there.</p>
