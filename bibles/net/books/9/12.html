<a name="1Sa 12:2"></a><span class="versenum">2</span> Now look! This king walks before you. As for me, I am old and gray, though my sons are here with you. I have walked before you from the time of my youth till the present day. 
<a name="1Sa 12:3"></a><span class="versenum">3</span> Here I am. Bring a charge against me before the <sc>Lord and before his chosen king.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,12,124) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,12,124) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,12,124) ><SUP>4</SUP></A> Whose ox have I taken?

<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 12:4"></a><span class="versenum">4</span> They replied, &#8220;You have not wronged us or oppressed us. You have not taken anything from the hand of anyone.&#8221; 
<a name="1Sa 12:5"></a><span class="versenum">5</span> He said to them, &#8220;The <sc>Lord is witness against you, and his chosen king<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,12,126) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,12,126) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,12,126) ><SUP>6</SUP></A> is witness this day, that you have not found any reason to accuse me.&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,12,127) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,12,127) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,12,127) ><SUP>7</SUP></A> They said, &#8220;He is witness!&#8221; </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 12:6"></a><span class="versenum">6</span> Samuel said to the people, &#8220;The <sc>Lord is the one who chose Moses and Aaron and who brought your ancestors<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,12,128) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,12,128) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,12,128) ><SUP>8</SUP></A> up from the land of Egypt. 
<a name="1Sa 12:7"></a><span class="versenum">7</span> Now take your positions, so I may confront you<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,12,129) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,12,129) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,12,129) ><SUP>9</SUP></A> before the <sc>Lord regarding all the <sc>Lord&#8217;s just actions toward you and your ancestors.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,12,1210) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,12,1210) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,12,1210) ><SUP>10</SUP></A> 
<a name="1Sa 12:8"></a><span class="versenum">8</span> When Jacob entered Egypt, your ancestors cried out to the <sc>Lord. The <sc>Lord sent Moses and Aaron, and they led your ancestors out of Egypt and settled them in this place.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 12:9"></a><span class="versenum">9</span> &#8220;But they forgot the <sc>Lord their God, so he gave<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,12,1211) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,12,1211) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,12,1211) ><SUP>11</SUP></A> them into the hand of Sisera, the general in command of Hazor&#8217;s<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,12,1212) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,12,1212) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,12,1212) ><SUP>12</SUP></A> army,<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,12,1213) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,12,1213) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,12,1213) ><SUP>13</SUP></A> and into the hand of the Philistines and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them. 
<a name="1Sa 12:10"></a><span class="versenum">10</span> Then they cried out to the <sc>Lord and admitted,<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,12,1214) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,12,1214) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,12,1214) ><SUP>14</SUP></A> &#8216;We have sinned, for we have forsaken the <sc>Lord and have served the Baals and the images of Ashtoreth.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,12,1215) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,12,1215) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,12,1215) ><SUP>15</SUP></A> Now deliver us from the hand of our enemies so that we may serve you.&#8217;<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,12,1216) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,12,1216) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,12,1216) ><SUP>16</SUP></A> 
<a name="1Sa 12:11"></a><span class="versenum">11</span> So the <sc>Lord sent Jerub-Baal,<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,12,1217) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,12,1217) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,12,1217) ><SUP>17</SUP></A> Barak,<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,12,1218) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,12,1218) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,12,1218) ><SUP>18</SUP></A> Jephthah, and Samuel,<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,12,1219) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,12,1219) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,12,1219) ><SUP>19</SUP></A> and he delivered you from the hand of the enemies all around you, and you were able to live securely.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 12:12"></a><span class="versenum">12</span> &#8220;When you saw that King Nahash of the Ammonites was advancing against you, you said to me, &#8216;No! A king will rule over us&#8217; &#8211; even though the <sc>Lord your God is your king! 
<a name="1Sa 12:13"></a><span class="versenum">13</span> Now look! Here is the king you have chosen &#8211; the one that you asked for! Look, the <sc>Lord has given you a king! 
<a name="1Sa 12:14"></a><span class="versenum">14</span> If you fear the <sc>Lord, serving him and obeying him<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,12,1220) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,12,1220) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,12,1220) ><SUP>20</SUP></A> and not rebelling against what he says,<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,12,1221) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,12,1221) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,12,1221) ><SUP>21</SUP></A> and if both you and the king who rules over you follow the <sc>Lord your God, all will be well.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,12,1222) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,12,1222) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,12,1222) ><SUP>22</SUP></A> 
<a name="1Sa 12:15"></a><span class="versenum">15</span> But if you don&#8217;t obey<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,12,1223) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,12,1223) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,12,1223) ><SUP>23</SUP></A> the <sc>Lord and rebel against what the <sc>Lord says, the hand of the <sc>Lord will be against both you and your king.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,12,1224) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,12,1224) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,12,1224) ><SUP>24</SUP></A></p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 12:16"></a><span class="versenum">16</span> &#8220;So now, take your positions and watch this great thing that the <sc>Lord is about to do in your sight. 
<a name="1Sa 12:17"></a><span class="versenum">17</span> Is this not the time of the wheat harvest? I will call on the <sc>Lord so that he makes it thunder and rain. Realize and see what a great sin you have committed before the <sc>Lord by asking for a king for yourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 12:18"></a><span class="versenum">18</span> So Samuel called to the <sc>Lord, and the <sc>Lord made it thunder and rain that day. All the people were very afraid of both the <sc>Lord and Samuel. 
<a name="1Sa 12:19"></a><span class="versenum">19</span> All the people said to Samuel, &#8220;Pray to the <sc>Lord your God on behalf of us &#8211; your servants &#8211; so we won&#8217;t die, for we have added to all our sins by asking for a king.&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,12,1225) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,12,1225) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,12,1225) ><SUP>25</SUP></A></p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 12:20"></a><span class="versenum">20</span> Then Samuel said to the people, &#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid. You have indeed sinned.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,12,1226) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,12,1226) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,12,1226) ><SUP>26</SUP></A> However, don&#8217;t turn aside from the <sc>Lord. Serve the <sc>Lord with all your heart. 
<a name="1Sa 12:21"></a><span class="versenum">21</span> You should not turn aside after empty things that can&#8217;t profit and can&#8217;t deliver, since they are empty.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,12,1227) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,12,1227) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,12,1227) ><SUP>27</SUP></A> 
<a name="1Sa 12:22"></a><span class="versenum">22</span> The <sc>Lord will not abandon his people because he wants to uphold his great reputation.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,12,1228) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,12,1228) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,12,1228) ><SUP>28</SUP></A> The <sc>Lord was pleased to make you his own people. 
<a name="1Sa 12:23"></a><span class="versenum">23</span> As far as I am concerned, far be it from me to sin against the <sc>Lord by ceasing to pray for you! I will instruct you in the way that is good and upright. 
<a name="1Sa 12:24"></a><span class="versenum">24</span> However, fear the <sc>Lord and serve him faithfully with all your heart. Just look at the great things he has done for you! 
<a name="1Sa 12:25"></a><span class="versenum">25</span> But if you continue to do evil, both you and your king will be swept away.&#8221;</p>
