<p class=bodytext><p class="paragraphtitle">The Call of Samuel</p><p class="bodytext"><a name="1Sa 3:1"></a><span class="versenum">1</span> Now the boy Samuel continued serving the <sc>Lord under Eli&#8217;s supervision.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,3,31) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,3,31) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,3,31) ><SUP>1</SUP></A> Word from the <sc>Lord was rare in those days; revelatory visions were infrequent.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 3:2"></a><span class="versenum">2</span> Eli&#8217;s eyes had begun to fail, so that he was unable to see well. At that time he was lying down in his place, 
<a name="1Sa 3:3"></a><span class="versenum">3</span> and the lamp of God had not yet been extinguished. Samuel was lying down in the temple of the <sc>Lord as well; the ark of God was also there. 
<a name="1Sa 3:4"></a><span class="versenum">4</span> The <sc>Lord called to Samuel, and he replied, &#8220;Here I am!&#8221; 
<a name="1Sa 3:5"></a><span class="versenum">5</span> Then he ran to Eli and said, &#8220;Here I am, for you called me.&#8221; But Eli<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,3,32) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,3,32) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,3,32) ><SUP>2</SUP></A> said, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t call you. Go back and lie down.&#8221; So he went back and lay down. 
<a name="1Sa 3:6"></a><span class="versenum">6</span> The <sc>Lord again called, &#8220;Samuel!&#8221; So Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, &#8220;Here I am, for you called me.&#8221; But Eli<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,3,33) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,3,33) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,3,33) ><SUP>3</SUP></A> said, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t call you, my son. Go back and lie down.&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 3:7"></a><span class="versenum">7</span> Now Samuel did not yet know the <sc>Lord; the word of the <sc>Lord had not yet been revealed to him. 
<a name="1Sa 3:8"></a><span class="versenum">8</span> Then the <sc>Lord called Samuel a third time. So he got up and went to Eli and said, &#8220;Here I am, for you called me!&#8221; Eli then realized that it was the <sc>Lord who was calling the boy. 
<a name="1Sa 3:9"></a><span class="versenum">9</span> So Eli said to Samuel, &#8220;Go back and lie down. When he calls you, say, &#8220;Speak, <sc>Lord, for your servant is listening.&#8221; So Samuel went back and lay down in his place.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 3:10"></a><span class="versenum">10</span> Then the <sc>Lord came and stood nearby, calling as he had previously done, &#8220;Samuel! Samuel!&#8221; Samuel replied, &#8220;Speak, for your servant is listening!&#8221; 
<a name="1Sa 3:11"></a><span class="versenum">11</span> The <sc>Lord said to Samuel, &#8220;Look! I am about to do something in Israel;<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,3,34) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,3,34) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,3,34) ><SUP>4</SUP></A> when anyone hears about it, both of his ears will tingle. 
<a name="1Sa 3:12"></a><span class="versenum">12</span> On that day I will carry out<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,3,35) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,3,35) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,3,35) ><SUP>5</SUP></A> against Eli everything that I spoke about his house &#8211; from start to finish! 
<a name="1Sa 3:13"></a><span class="versenum">13</span> You<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,3,36) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,3,36) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,3,36) ><SUP>6</SUP></A> should tell him that I am about to judge his house forever because of<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,3,37) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,3,37) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,3,37) ><SUP>7</SUP></A> the sin that he knew about. For his sons were cursing God,<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,3,38) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,3,38) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,3,38) ><SUP>8</SUP></A> and he did not rebuke them. 
<a name="1Sa 3:14"></a><span class="versenum">14</span> Therefore I swore an oath to the house of Eli, &#8216;The sin of the house of Eli can never be forgiven by sacrifice or by grain offering.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 3:15"></a><span class="versenum">15</span> So Samuel lay down until morning. Then he opened the doors of the <sc>Lord&#8217;s house. But Samuel was afraid to tell Eli about the vision. 
<a name="1Sa 3:16"></a><span class="versenum">16</span> However, Eli called Samuel and said, &#8220;Samuel, my son!&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Here I am.&#8221; 
<a name="1Sa 3:17"></a><span class="versenum">17</span> Eli<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,3,39) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,3,39) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,3,39) ><SUP>9</SUP></A> said, &#8220;What message did he speak to you? Don&#8217;t conceal it from me. God will judge you severely<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,3,310) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,3,310) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,3,310) ><SUP>10</SUP></A> if you conceal from me anything that he said to you!&#8221;</p>
