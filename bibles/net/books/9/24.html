<a name="1Sa 24:2"></a><span class="versenum">2</span> So Saul took three thousand select men from all Israel and went to find<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,24,241) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,24,241) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,24,241) ><SUP>1</SUP></A> David and his men in the region of<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,24,242) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,24,242) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,24,242) ><SUP>2</SUP></A> the rocks of the mountain goats.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,24,243) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,24,243) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,24,243) ><SUP>3</SUP></A> 
<a name="1Sa 24:3"></a><span class="versenum">3</span> He came to the sheepfolds by the road, where there was a cave. Saul went into it to relieve himself.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,24,244) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,24,244) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,24,244) ><SUP>4</SUP></A></p>
<p class="bodytext">Now David and his men were sitting in the recesses of the cave. 
<a name="1Sa 24:4"></a><span class="versenum">4</span> David&#8217;s men said to him, &#8220;This is the day about which the <sc>Lord said to you, &#8216;I will give your enemy into your hand, and you can do to him whatever seems appropriate to you.&#8217;&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,24,245) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,24,245) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,24,245) ><SUP>5</SUP></A> So David got up and quietly cut off an edge of Saul&#8217;s robe. 
<a name="1Sa 24:5"></a><span class="versenum">5</span> Afterward David&#8217;s conscience bothered him<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,24,246) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,24,246) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,24,246) ><SUP>6</SUP></A> because he had cut off an edge of Saul&#8217;s robe. 
<a name="1Sa 24:6"></a><span class="versenum">6</span> He said to his men, &#8220;May the <sc>Lord keep me far away from doing such a thing to my lord, who is the <sc>Lord&#8217;s chosen one,<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,24,247) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,24,247) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,24,247) ><SUP>7</SUP></A> by extending my hand against him. After all,<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,24,248) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,24,248) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,24,248) ><SUP>8</SUP></A> he is the <sc>Lord&#8217;s chosen one.&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,24,249) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,24,249) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,24,249) ><SUP>9</SUP></A> 
<a name="1Sa 24:7"></a><span class="versenum">7</span> David restrained his men with these words and did not allow them to rise up against Saul. Then Saul left the cave and started down<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,24,2410) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,24,2410) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,24,2410) ><SUP>10</SUP></A> the road.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 24:8"></a><span class="versenum">8</span> Afterward David got up and went out of the cave. He called out after Saul, &#8220;My lord, O king!&#8221; When Saul looked behind him, David kneeled down and bowed with his face to the ground. 
<a name="1Sa 24:9"></a><span class="versenum">9</span> David said to Saul, &#8220;Why do you pay attention when men say, &#8216;David is seeking to do you harm&#8217;? 
<a name="1Sa 24:10"></a><span class="versenum">10</span> Today your own eyes see how the <sc>Lord delivered you &#8211; this very day &#8211; into my hands in the cave. Some told me to kill you, but I had pity<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,24,2411) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,24,2411) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,24,2411) ><SUP>11</SUP></A> on you and said, &#8216;I will not extend my hand against my lord, for he is the <sc>Lord&#8217;s chosen one.&#8217;<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,24,2412) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,24,2412) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,24,2412) ><SUP>12</SUP></A> 
<a name="1Sa 24:11"></a><span class="versenum">11</span> Look, my father, and see the edge of your robe in my hand! When I cut off the edge of your robe, I didn&#8217;t kill you. So realize and understand that I am not planning<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,24,2413) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,24,2413) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,24,2413) ><SUP>13</SUP></A> evil or rebellion. Even though I have not sinned against you, you are waiting in ambush to take my life. 
<a name="1Sa 24:12"></a><span class="versenum">12</span> May the <sc>Lord judge between the two of us, and may the <sc>Lord vindicate me over you, but my hand will not be against you. 
<a name="1Sa 24:13"></a><span class="versenum">13</span> It&#8217;s like the old proverb says: &#8216;From evil people evil proceeds.&#8217; But my hand will not be against you. 
<a name="1Sa 24:14"></a><span class="versenum">14</span> Who has the king of Israel come out after? Who is it that you are pursuing? A dead dog? A single flea? 
<a name="1Sa 24:15"></a><span class="versenum">15</span> May the <sc>Lord be our judge and arbiter. May he see and arbitrate my case and deliver me from your hands!&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 24:16"></a><span class="versenum">16</span> When David finished speaking these words to Saul, Saul said, &#8220;Is that your voice, my son David?&#8221; Then Saul wept loudly.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,24,2414) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,24,2414) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,24,2414) ><SUP>14</SUP></A> 
<a name="1Sa 24:17"></a><span class="versenum">17</span> He said to David, &#8220;You are more innocent<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,24,2415) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,24,2415) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,24,2415) ><SUP>15</SUP></A> than I, for you have treated me well, even though I have tried to harm you! 
<a name="1Sa 24:18"></a><span class="versenum">18</span> You have explained today how you have treated me well. The <sc>Lord delivered me into your hand, but you did not kill me. 
<a name="1Sa 24:19"></a><span class="versenum">19</span> Now if a man finds his enemy, does he send him on his way in good shape? May the <sc>Lord repay you with good this day for what you have done to me. 
<a name="1Sa 24:20"></a><span class="versenum">20</span> Now look, I realize that you will in fact be king and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hand. 
<a name="1Sa 24:21"></a><span class="versenum">21</span> So now swear to me in the <sc>Lord&#8217;s name<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,24,2416) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,24,2416) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,24,2416) ><SUP>16</SUP></A> that you will not kill<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,24,2417) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,24,2417) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,24,2417) ><SUP>17</SUP></A> my descendants after me or destroy my name from the house of my father.&#8221; </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 24:22"></a><span class="versenum">22</span> David promised Saul this on oath.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,24,2418) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,24,2418) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,24,2418) ><SUP>18</SUP></A> Then Saul went to his house, and David and his men went up to the stronghold.</p>
