<p class=bodytext><p class="paragraphtitle">The Death of Samuel </p><p class="bodytext"><a name="1Sa 25:1"></a><span class="versenum">1</span> Samuel died, and all Israel assembled and mourned him. They buried him at his home in Ramah. Then David left and went down to the desert of Paran.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,25,251) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,25,251) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,25,251) ><SUP>1</SUP></A></p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">David Marries Abigail the Widow of Nabal</p><p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 25:2"></a><span class="versenum">2</span> There was a man in Maon whose business was in Carmel. This man was very wealthy;<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,25,252) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,25,252) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,25,252) ><SUP>2</SUP></A> he owned three thousand sheep and a thousand goats. At that time he was shearing his sheep in Carmel. 
<a name="1Sa 25:3"></a><span class="versenum">3</span> The man&#8217;s name was Nabal,<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,25,253) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,25,253) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,25,253) ><SUP>3</SUP></A> and his wife&#8217;s name was Abigail. She was both wise<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,25,254) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,25,254) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,25,254) ><SUP>4</SUP></A> and beautiful, but the man was harsh and his deeds were evil. He was a Calebite.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 25:4"></a><span class="versenum">4</span> When David heard in the desert that Nabal was shearing his sheep, 
<a name="1Sa 25:5"></a><span class="versenum">5</span> he<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,25,255) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,25,255) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,25,255) ><SUP>5</SUP></A> sent ten servants,<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,25,256) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,25,256) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,25,256) ><SUP>6</SUP></A> saying to them,<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,25,257) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,25,257) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,25,257) ><SUP>7</SUP></A> &#8220;Go up to Carmel to see Nabal and give him greetings in my name.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,25,258) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,25,258) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,25,258) ><SUP>8</SUP></A> 
<a name="1Sa 25:6"></a><span class="versenum">6</span> Then you will say to my brother,<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,25,259) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,25,259) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,25,259) ><SUP>9</SUP></A> &#8220;Peace to you and your house! Peace to all that is yours! 
<a name="1Sa 25:7"></a><span class="versenum">7</span> Now I hear that they are shearing sheep for you. When your shepherds were with us, we neither insulted them nor harmed them the whole time they were in Carmel. 
<a name="1Sa 25:8"></a><span class="versenum">8</span> Ask your own servants; they can tell you! May my servants find favor in your sight, for we have come<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,25,2510) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,25,2510) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,25,2510) ><SUP>10</SUP></A> at the time of a holiday. Please provide us &#8211; your servants<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,25,2511) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,25,2511) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,25,2511) ><SUP>11</SUP></A> and your son David &#8211; with whatever you can spare.&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,25,2512) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,25,2512) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,25,2512) ><SUP>12</SUP></A></p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 25:9"></a><span class="versenum">9</span> So David&#8217;s servants went and spoke all these words to Nabal in David&#8217;s name. Then they paused. 
<a name="1Sa 25:10"></a><span class="versenum">10</span> But Nabal responded to David&#8217;s servants, &#8220;Who is David, and who is this son of Jesse? This is a time when many servants are breaking away from their masters! 
<a name="1Sa 25:11"></a><span class="versenum">11</span> Should I take my bread and my water and my meat that I have slaughtered for my shearers and give them to these men? I don&#8217;t even know where they came from!&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 25:12"></a><span class="versenum">12</span> So David&#8217;s servants went on their way. When they had returned, they came and told David<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,25,2513) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,25,2513) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,25,2513) ><SUP>13</SUP></A> all these things. 
<a name="1Sa 25:13"></a><span class="versenum">13</span> Then David instructed his men, &#8220;Each of you strap on your sword!&#8221; So each one strapped on his sword, and David also strapped on his sword. About four hundred men followed David up, while two hundred stayed behind with the equipment.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 25:14"></a><span class="versenum">14</span> But one of the servants told Nabal&#8217;s wife Abigail, &#8220;David sent messengers from the desert to greet<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,25,2514) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,25,2514) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,25,2514) ><SUP>14</SUP></A> our lord, but he screamed at them. 
<a name="1Sa 25:15"></a><span class="versenum">15</span> These men were very good to us. They did not insult us, nor did we sustain any loss during the entire time we were together<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,25,2515) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,25,2515) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,25,2515) ><SUP>15</SUP></A> in the field. 
<a name="1Sa 25:16"></a><span class="versenum">16</span> Both night and day they were a protective wall for us the entire time we were with them, while we were tending our flocks. 
<a name="1Sa 25:17"></a><span class="versenum">17</span> Now be aware of this, and see what you can do. For disaster has been planned for our lord and his entire household.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,25,2516) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,25,2516) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,25,2516) ><SUP>16</SUP></A> He is such a wicked person<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,25,2517) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,25,2517) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,25,2517) ><SUP>17</SUP></A> that no one tells him anything!&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 25:18"></a><span class="versenum">18</span> So Abigail quickly took two hundred loaves of bread, two containers<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,25,2518) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,25,2518) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,25,2518) ><SUP>18</SUP></A> of wine, five prepared sheep, five seahs<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,25,2519) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,25,2519) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,25,2519) ><SUP>19</SUP></A> of roasted grain, a hundred bunches of raisins, and two hundred lumps of pressed figs. She loaded them on donkeys 
<a name="1Sa 25:19"></a><span class="versenum">19</span> and said to her servants, &#8220;Go on ahead of me. I will come after you.&#8221; But she did not tell her husband Nabal.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 25:20"></a><span class="versenum">20</span> Riding on her donkey, she went down under cover of the mountain. David and his men were coming down to meet her, and she encountered them. 
<a name="1Sa 25:21"></a><span class="versenum">21</span> Now David had been thinking,<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,25,2520) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,25,2520) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,25,2520) ><SUP>20</SUP></A> &#8220;In vain I guarded everything that belonged to this man in the desert. I didn&#8217;t take anything from him. But he has repaid my good with evil. 
<a name="1Sa 25:22"></a><span class="versenum">22</span> God will severely punish David,<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,25,2521) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,25,2521) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,25,2521) ><SUP>21</SUP></A> if I leave alive until morning even one male<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,25,2522) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,25,2522) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,25,2522) ><SUP>22</SUP></A> from all those who belong to him!&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 25:23"></a><span class="versenum">23</span> When Abigail saw David, she got down quickly from the donkey, threw herself down before David, and bowed to the ground. 
<a name="1Sa 25:24"></a><span class="versenum">24</span> Falling at his feet, she said, &#8220;My lord, I accept all the guilt! But please let your female servant speak with my lord! Please listen to the words of your servant! 
<a name="1Sa 25:25"></a><span class="versenum">25</span> My lord should not pay attention to this wicked man Nabal. He simply lives up to his name! His name means &#8216;fool,&#8217; and he is indeed foolish!<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,25,2523) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,25,2523) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,25,2523) ><SUP>23</SUP></A> But I, your servant, did not see the servants my lord sent.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,25,2524) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,25,2524) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,25,2524) ><SUP>24</SUP></A></p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 25:26"></a><span class="versenum">26</span> &#8220;Now, my lord, as surely as the <sc>Lord lives and as surely as you live, it is the <sc>Lord who has kept you from shedding blood and taking matters into your own hands. Now may your enemies and those who seek to harm my lord be like Nabal. 
<a name="1Sa 25:27"></a><span class="versenum">27</span> Now let this present<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,25,2525) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,25,2525) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,25,2525) ><SUP>25</SUP></A> that your servant has brought to my lord be given to the servants who follow<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,25,2526) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,25,2526) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,25,2526) ><SUP>26</SUP></A> my lord. 
<a name="1Sa 25:28"></a><span class="versenum">28</span> Please forgive the sin of your servant, for the <sc>Lord will certainly establish the house of my lord, because my lord fights the battles of the <sc>Lord. May no evil be found in you all your days! 
<a name="1Sa 25:29"></a><span class="versenum">29</span> When someone sets out to chase you and to take your life, the life of my lord will be wrapped securely in the bag<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,25,2527) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,25,2527) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,25,2527) ><SUP>27</SUP></A> of the living by the <sc>Lord your God. But he will sling away the lives of your enemies from the sling&#8217;s pocket! 
<a name="1Sa 25:30"></a><span class="versenum">30</span> The <sc>Lord will do for my lord everything that he promised you,<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,25,2528) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,25,2528) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,25,2528) ><SUP>28</SUP></A> and he will make<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,25,2529) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,25,2529) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,25,2529) ><SUP>29</SUP></A> you a leader over Israel. 
<a name="1Sa 25:31"></a><span class="versenum">31</span> Your conscience will not be overwhelmed with guilt<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,25,2530) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,25,2530) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,25,2530) ><SUP>30</SUP></A> for having poured out innocent blood and for having taken matters into your own hands. When the <sc>Lord has granted my lord success,<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,25,2531) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,25,2531) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,25,2531) ><SUP>31</SUP></A> please remember your servant.&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 25:32"></a><span class="versenum">32</span> Then David said to Abigail, &#8220;Praised<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,25,2532) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,25,2532) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,25,2532) ><SUP>32</SUP></A> be the <sc>Lord, the God of Israel, who has sent you this day to meet me! 
<a name="1Sa 25:33"></a><span class="versenum">33</span> Praised be your good judgment! May you yourself be rewarded<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,25,2533) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,25,2533) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,25,2533) ><SUP>33</SUP></A> for having prevented me this day from shedding blood and taking matters into my own hands! 
<a name="1Sa 25:34"></a><span class="versenum">34</span> Otherwise, as surely as the <sc>Lord, the God of Israel, lives &#8211; he who has prevented me from harming you &#8211; if you had not come so quickly to meet me, by morning&#8217;s light not even one male belonging to Nabal would have remained alive!&#8221; 
<a name="1Sa 25:35"></a><span class="versenum">35</span> Then David took from her hand what she had brought to him. He said to her, &#8220;Go back<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,25,2534) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,25,2534) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,25,2534) ><SUP>34</SUP></A> to your home in peace. Be assured that I have listened to you<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,25,2535) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,25,2535) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,25,2535) ><SUP>35</SUP></A> and responded favorably.&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,25,2536) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,25,2536) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,25,2536) ><SUP>36</SUP></A></p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 25:36"></a><span class="versenum">36</span> When Abigail went back to Nabal, he was holding a banquet in his house like that of the king. Nabal was having a good time<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,25,2537) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,25,2537) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,25,2537) ><SUP>37</SUP></A> and was very intoxicated. She told him absolutely nothing<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,25,2538) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,25,2538) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,25,2538) ><SUP>38</SUP></A> until morning&#8217;s light. 
<a name="1Sa 25:37"></a><span class="versenum">37</span> In the morning, when Nabal was sober,<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,25,2539) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,25,2539) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,25,2539) ><SUP>39</SUP></A> his wife told him about these matters. He had a stroke and was paralyzed.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,25,2540) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,25,2540) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,25,2540) ><SUP>40</SUP></A> 
<a name="1Sa 25:38"></a><span class="versenum">38</span> After about ten days the <sc>Lord struck Nabal down and he died.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 25:39"></a><span class="versenum">39</span> When David heard that Nabal had died, he said, &#8220;Praised be the <sc>Lord who has vindicated me and avenged the insult that I suffered from Nabal!<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,25,2541) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,25,2541) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,25,2541) ><SUP>41</SUP></A> The <sc>Lord has kept his servant from doing evil, and he has repaid Nabal for his evil deeds.&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,25,2542) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,25,2542) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,25,2542) ><SUP>42</SUP></A> Then David sent word to Abigail and asked her to become his wife.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 25:40"></a><span class="versenum">40</span> So the servants of David went to Abigail at Carmel and said to her, &#8220;David has sent us to you to bring you back to be his wife.&#8221; 
<a name="1Sa 25:41"></a><span class="versenum">41</span> She arose, bowed her face toward the ground, and said, &#8220;Your female servant, like a lowly servant, will wash<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,25,2543) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,25,2543) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,25,2543) ><SUP>43</SUP></A> the feet of the servants of my lord.&#8221; 
<a name="1Sa 25:42"></a><span class="versenum">42</span> Then Abigail quickly went and mounted her donkey, with five of her female servants accompanying her.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,25,2544) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,25,2544) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,25,2544) ><SUP>44</SUP></A> She followed David&#8217;s messengers and became his wife.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 25:43"></a><span class="versenum">43</span> David had also married<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,25,2545) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,25,2545) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,25,2545) ><SUP>45</SUP></A> Ahinoam from Jezreel; the two of them became his wives. 
<a name="1Sa 25:44"></a><span class="versenum">44</span> (Now Saul had given his daughter Michal, David&#8217;s wife, to Paltiel son of Laish, who was from Gallim.)</p>
