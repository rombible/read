<a name="1Sa 13:23"></a><span class="versenum">23</span> A garrison of the Philistines had gone out to the pass at Micmash. <a name="1Sa 14:1"></a><span class="versenum">1</span> Then one day Jonathan son of Saul said to his armor bearer,<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,14,141) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,14,141) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,14,141) ><SUP>1</SUP></A> &#8220;Come on, let&#8217;s go over to the Philistine garrison that is opposite us.&#8221; But he did not let his father know.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 14:2"></a><span class="versenum">2</span> Now Saul was sitting under a pomegranate tree in Migron, on the outskirts of Gibeah. The army that was with him numbered about six hundred men. 
<a name="1Sa 14:3"></a><span class="versenum">3</span> Now Ahijah was carrying<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,14,142) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,14,142) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,14,142) ><SUP>2</SUP></A> an ephod. He was the son of Ahitub, who was the brother of Ichabod and a son of Phineas, son of Eli, the priest of the <sc>Lord in Shiloh. The army was unaware that Jonathan had left.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 14:4"></a><span class="versenum">4</span> Now there was a steep cliff on each side of the pass through which Jonathan intended to go to reach the Philistine garrison. One cliff was named Bozez, the other Seneh. 
<a name="1Sa 14:5"></a><span class="versenum">5</span> The cliff to the north was closer to Micmash, the one to the south closer to Geba. </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 14:6"></a><span class="versenum">6</span> Jonathan said to his armor bearer, &#8220;Come on, let&#8217;s go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised men. Perhaps the <sc>Lord will intervene<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,14,143) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,14,143) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,14,143) ><SUP>3</SUP></A> for us. Nothing can prevent the <sc>Lord from delivering, whether by many or by a few.&#8221; 
<a name="1Sa 14:7"></a><span class="versenum">7</span> His armor bearer said to him, &#8220;Do everything that is on your mind.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,14,144) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,14,144) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,14,144) ><SUP>4</SUP></A> Do as you&#8217;re inclined.

<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 14:8"></a><span class="versenum">8</span> Jonathan replied, &#8220;All right!<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,14,146) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,14,146) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,14,146) ><SUP>6</SUP></A> We&#8217;ll go over to these men and fight them. 
<a name="1Sa 14:9"></a><span class="versenum">9</span> If they say to us, &#8216;Stay put until we approach you,&#8217; we will stay<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,14,147) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,14,147) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,14,147) ><SUP>7</SUP></A> right there and not go up to them. 
<a name="1Sa 14:10"></a><span class="versenum">10</span> But if they say, &#8216;Come up against us,&#8217; we will go up. For in that case the <sc>Lord has given them into our hand &#8211; it will be a sign to us.&#8221; </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 14:11"></a><span class="versenum">11</span> When they<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,14,148) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,14,148) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,14,148) ><SUP>8</SUP></A> made themselves known to the Philistine garrison, the Philistines said, &#8220;Look! The Hebrews are coming out of the holes in which they hid themselves.&#8221; 
<a name="1Sa 14:12"></a><span class="versenum">12</span> Then the men of the garrison said to Jonathan and his armor bearer, &#8220;Come on up to us so we can teach you a thing or two!&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,14,149) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,14,149) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,14,149) ><SUP>9</SUP></A> Then Jonathan said to his armor bearer, &#8220;Come up behind me, for the <sc>Lord has given<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,14,1410) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,14,1410) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,14,1410) ><SUP>10</SUP></A> them into the hand of Israel!&#8221; </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 14:13"></a><span class="versenum">13</span> Jonathan crawled up on his hands and feet, with his armor bearer following behind him. Jonathan struck down the Philistines,<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,14,1411) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,14,1411) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,14,1411) ><SUP>11</SUP></A> while his armor bearer came along behind him and killed them.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,14,1412) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,14,1412) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,14,1412) ><SUP>12</SUP></A> 
<a name="1Sa 14:14"></a><span class="versenum">14</span> In this initial skirmish Jonathan and his armor bearer struck down about twenty men in an area that measured half an acre.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 14:15"></a><span class="versenum">15</span> Then fear overwhelmed<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,14,1413) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,14,1413) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,14,1413) ><SUP>13</SUP></A> those who were in the camp, those who were in the field, all the army in the garrison, and the raiding bands. They trembled and the ground shook. This fear was caused by God.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,14,1414) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,14,1414) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,14,1414) ><SUP>14</SUP></A></p>

<a name="1Sa 14:17"></a><span class="versenum">17</span> So Saul said to the army that was with him, &#8220;Muster the troops and see who is no longer with us.&#8221; When they mustered the troops,<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,14,1418) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,14,1418) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,14,1418) ><SUP>18</SUP></A> Jonathan and his armor bearer were not there. 
<a name="1Sa 14:18"></a><span class="versenum">18</span> So Saul said to Ahijah, &#8220;Bring near the ephod,&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,14,1419) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,14,1419) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,14,1419) ><SUP>19</SUP></A> for he was at that time wearing the ephod.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,14,1420) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,14,1420) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,14,1420) ><SUP>20</SUP></A>

So Saul said to the priest, &#8220;Withdraw your hand!&#8221; </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 14:20"></a><span class="versenum">20</span> Saul and all the army that was with him assembled and marched into battle, where they found<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,14,1422) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,14,1422) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,14,1422) ><SUP>22</SUP></A> the Philistines in total panic killing one another with their swords.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,14,1423) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,14,1423) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,14,1423) ><SUP>23</SUP></A> 
<a name="1Sa 14:21"></a><span class="versenum">21</span> The Hebrews who had earlier gone over to the Philistine side<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,14,1424) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,14,1424) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,14,1424) ><SUP>24</SUP></A> joined the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan. 
<a name="1Sa 14:22"></a><span class="versenum">22</span> When all the Israelites who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines had fled, they too pursued them in battle. 
<a name="1Sa 14:23"></a><span class="versenum">23</span> So the <sc>Lord delivered Israel that day, and the battle shifted over to Beth Aven.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,14,1425) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,14,1425) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,14,1425) ><SUP>25</SUP></A> </p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Jonathan Violates Saul&#8217;s Oath</p><p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 14:24"></a><span class="versenum">24</span> Now the men of Israel were hard pressed that day, for Saul had made the army agree to this oath: &#8220;Cursed be the man who eats food before evening! I will get my vengeance on my enemies!&#8221; So no one in the army ate anything. </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 14:25"></a><span class="versenum">25</span> Now the whole army<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,14,1426) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,14,1426) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,14,1426) ><SUP>26</SUP></A> entered the forest and there was honey on the ground.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,14,1427) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,14,1427) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,14,1427) ><SUP>27</SUP></A> 
<a name="1Sa 14:26"></a><span class="versenum">26</span> When the army entered the forest, they saw<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,14,1428) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,14,1428) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,14,1428) ><SUP>28</SUP></A> the honey flowing, but no one ate any of it,<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,14,1429) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,14,1429) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,14,1429) ><SUP>29</SUP></A> for the army was afraid of the oath. 
<a name="1Sa 14:27"></a><span class="versenum">27</span> But Jonathan had not heard about the oath his father had made the army take. He extended the end of his staff that was in his hand and dipped it in the honeycomb. When he ate it,<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,14,1430) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,14,1430) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,14,1430) ><SUP>30</SUP></A> his eyes gleamed.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,14,1431) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,14,1431) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,14,1431) ><SUP>31</SUP></A> 
<a name="1Sa 14:28"></a><span class="versenum">28</span> Then someone from the army informed him, &#8220;Your father put the army under a strict oath<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,14,1432) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,14,1432) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,14,1432) ><SUP>32</SUP></A> saying, &#8216;Cursed be the man who eats food today!&#8217; That is why the army is tired.&#8221; 
<a name="1Sa 14:29"></a><span class="versenum">29</span> Then Jonathan said, &#8220;My father has caused trouble for the land. See how my eyes gleamed<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,14,1433) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,14,1433) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,14,1433) ><SUP>33</SUP></A> when I tasted just a little of this honey. 
<a name="1Sa 14:30"></a><span class="versenum">30</span> Certainly if the army had eaten some of the enemies&#8217; provisions that they came across today, would not the slaughter of the Philistines have been even greater?&#8221; </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 14:31"></a><span class="versenum">31</span> On that day the army struck down the Philistines from Micmash to Aijalon, and they became very tired. 
<a name="1Sa 14:32"></a><span class="versenum">32</span> So the army rushed greedily on<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,14,1434) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,14,1434) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,14,1434) ><SUP>34</SUP></A> the<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,14,1435) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,14,1435) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,14,1435) ><SUP>35</SUP></A> plunder, confiscating sheep, cattle, and calves. They slaughtered them right on the ground, and the army ate them blood and all.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 14:33"></a><span class="versenum">33</span> Now it was reported to Saul, &#8220;Look, the army is sinning against the <sc>Lord by eating even the blood.&#8221; He said, &#8220;All of you have broken the covenant!<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,14,1436) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,14,1436) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,14,1436) ><SUP>36</SUP></A> Roll a large stone over here to me.&#8221; 
<a name="1Sa 14:34"></a><span class="versenum">34</span> Then Saul said, &#8220;Scatter out among the army and say to them, &#8216;Each of you bring to me your ox and sheep and slaughter them in this spot and eat. But don&#8217;t sin against the <sc>Lord by eating the blood.&#8221; So that night each one brought his ox and slaughtered it there.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,14,1437) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,14,1437) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,14,1437) ><SUP>37</SUP></A> 
<a name="1Sa 14:35"></a><span class="versenum">35</span> Then Saul built an altar for the <sc>Lord; it was the first time he had built an altar for the <sc>Lord.</p>

<a name="1Sa 14:37"></a><span class="versenum">37</span> So Saul asked God, &#8220;Should I go down after the Philistines? Will you deliver them into the hand of Israel?&#8221; But he did not answer him that day. </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Sa 14:38"></a><span class="versenum">38</span> Then Saul said, &#8220;All you leaders of the army come here. Find out<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,14,1442) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,14,1442) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,14,1442) ><SUP>42</SUP></A> how this sin occurred today. 
<a name="1Sa 14:39"></a><span class="versenum">39</span> For as surely as the <sc>Lord, the deliverer of Israel, lives, even if it turns out to be my own son Jonathan, he will certainly die!&#8221; But no one from the army said anything.<a onclick=vOpenNote(9,14,1443) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,9,14,1443) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,9,14,1443) ><SUP>43</SUP></A></p>
