<a name="Mk 5:3"></a><span class="versenum">3</span> He lived among the tombs, and no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain. 
<a name="Mk 5:4"></a><span class="versenum">4</span> For his hands and feet had often been bound with chains and shackles,<a onclick=vOpenNote(41,5,56) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,41,5,56) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,41,5,56) ><SUP>6</SUP></A> but<a onclick=vOpenNote(41,5,57) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,41,5,57) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,41,5,57) ><SUP>7</SUP></A> he had torn the chains apart and broken the shackles in pieces. No one was strong enough to subdue him. 
<a name="Mk 5:5"></a><span class="versenum">5</span> Each night and every day among the tombs and in the mountains, he would cry out and cut himself with stones. 
<a name="Mk 5:6"></a><span class="versenum">6</span> When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and bowed down before him. 
<a name="Mk 5:7"></a><span class="versenum">7</span> Then<a onclick=vOpenNote(41,5,58) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,41,5,58) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,41,5,58) ><SUP>8</SUP></A> he cried out with a loud voice, &#8220;Leave me alone,<a onclick=vOpenNote(41,5,59) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,41,5,59) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,41,5,59) ><SUP>9</SUP></A> Jesus, Son of the Most High God!

<a name="Mk 5:11"></a><span class="versenum">11</span> There on the hillside,<a onclick=vOpenNote(41,5,516) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,41,5,516) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,41,5,516) ><SUP>16</SUP></A> a great herd of pigs was feeding. 
<a name="Mk 5:12"></a><span class="versenum">12</span> And the demonic spirits<a onclick=vOpenNote(41,5,517) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,41,5,517) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,41,5,517) ><SUP>17</SUP></A> begged him, &#8220;Send us into the pigs. Let us enter them.&#8221;

<a name="Mk 5:15"></a><span class="versenum">15</span> They came to Jesus and saw the demon-possessed man sitting there, clothed and in his right mind &#8211; the one who had the &#8220;Legion&#8221; &#8211; and they were afraid. 
<a name="Mk 5:16"></a><span class="versenum">16</span> Those who had seen what had happened to the demon-possessed man reported it, and they also told about the pigs. 
<a name="Mk 5:17"></a><span class="versenum">17</span> Then<a onclick=vOpenNote(41,5,522) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,41,5,522) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,41,5,522) ><SUP>22</SUP></A> they asked Jesus<a onclick=vOpenNote(41,5,523) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,41,5,523) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,41,5,523) ><SUP>23</SUP></A> to leave their region. 
<a name="Mk 5:18"></a><span class="versenum">18</span> As he was getting into the boat the man who had been demon-possessed asked if he could go<a onclick=vOpenNote(41,5,524) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,41,5,524) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,41,5,524) ><SUP>24</SUP></A> with him.

Instead, he said to him, &#8220;Go to your home and to your people and tell them what the Lord has done for you,<a onclick=vOpenNote(41,5,527) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,41,5,527) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,41,5,527) ><SUP>27</SUP></A> that he had mercy on you.&#8221;

<a name="Mk 5:23"></a><span class="versenum">23</span> He asked him urgently, &#8220;My little daughter is near death. Come and lay your hands on her so that she may be healed and live.&#8221; 
<a name="Mk 5:24"></a><span class="versenum">24</span> Jesus<a onclick=vOpenNote(41,5,535) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,41,5,535) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,41,5,535) ><SUP>35</SUP></A> went with him, and a large crowd followed and pressed around him.</p>
<p class="bodytext">

<a name="Mk 5:26"></a><span class="versenum">26</span> She had endured a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all that she had. Yet instead of getting better, she grew worse. 
<a name="Mk 5:27"></a><span class="versenum">27</span> When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak,<a onclick=vOpenNote(41,5,539) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,41,5,539) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,41,5,539) ><SUP>39</SUP></A> 
<a name="Mk 5:28"></a><span class="versenum">28</span> for she kept saying,<a onclick=vOpenNote(41,5,540) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,41,5,540) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,41,5,540) ><SUP>40</SUP></A> &#8220;If only I touch his clothes, I will be healed.&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(41,5,541) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,41,5,541) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,41,5,541) ><SUP>41</SUP></A> 
<a name="Mk 5:29"></a><span class="versenum">29</span> At once the bleeding stopped,<a onclick=vOpenNote(41,5,542) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,41,5,542) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,41,5,542) ><SUP>42</SUP></A> and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease. 
<a name="Mk 5:30"></a><span class="versenum">30</span> Jesus knew at once that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and said, &#8220;Who touched my clothes?&#8221; 
<a name="Mk 5:31"></a><span class="versenum">31</span> His disciples said to him, &#8220;You see the crowd pressing against you and you say, &#8216;Who touched me?&#8217;&#8221; 
<a name="Mk 5:32"></a><span class="versenum">32</span> But<a onclick=vOpenNote(41,5,543) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,41,5,543) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,41,5,543) ><SUP>43</SUP></A> he looked around to see who had done it. 
<a name="Mk 5:33"></a><span class="versenum">33</span> Then the woman, with fear and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before him and told him the whole truth. 
<a name="Mk 5:34"></a><span class="versenum">34</span> He said to her, &#8220;Daughter, your faith has made you well.<a onclick=vOpenNote(41,5,544) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,41,5,544) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,41,5,544) ><SUP>44</SUP></A> Go in peace, and be healed of your disease.&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Mk 5:35"></a><span class="versenum">35</span> While he was still speaking, people came from the synagogue ruler&#8217;s<a onclick=vOpenNote(41,5,545) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,41,5,545) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,41,5,545) ><SUP>45</SUP></A> house saying, &#8220;Your daughter has died. Why trouble the teacher any longer?&#8221; 
<a name="Mk 5:36"></a><span class="versenum">36</span> But Jesus, paying no attention to what was said, told the synagogue ruler, &#8220;Do not be afraid; just believe.&#8221; 
<a name="Mk 5:37"></a><span class="versenum">37</span> He did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James,<a onclick=vOpenNote(41,5,546) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,41,5,546) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,41,5,546) ><SUP>46</SUP></A> and John, the brother of James. 
<a name="Mk 5:38"></a><span class="versenum">38</span> They came to the house of the synagogue ruler where<a onclick=vOpenNote(41,5,547) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,41,5,547) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,41,5,547) ><SUP>47</SUP></A> he saw noisy confusion and people weeping and wailing loudly.<a onclick=vOpenNote(41,5,548) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,41,5,548) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,41,5,548) ><SUP>48</SUP></A> 
<a name="Mk 5:39"></a><span class="versenum">39</span> When he entered he said to them, &#8220;Why are you distressed and weeping? The child is not dead but asleep.&#8221; 
<a name="Mk 5:40"></a><span class="versenum">40</span> And they began making fun of him.<a onclick=vOpenNote(41,5,549) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,41,5,549) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,41,5,549) ><SUP>49</SUP></A> But he put them all outside<a onclick=vOpenNote(41,5,550) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,41,5,550) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,41,5,550) ><SUP>50</SUP></A> and he took the child&#8217;s father and mother and his own companions<a onclick=vOpenNote(41,5,551) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,41,5,551) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,41,5,551) ><SUP>51</SUP></A> and went into the room where the child was.<a onclick=vOpenNote(41,5,552) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,41,5,552) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,41,5,552) ><SUP>52</SUP></A>

<a name="Mk 5:42"></a><span class="versenum">42</span> The girl got up at once and began to walk around (she was twelve years old).
