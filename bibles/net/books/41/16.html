<a name="Mk 16:2"></a><span class="versenum">2</span> And very early on the first day of the week, at sunrise, they went to the tomb. 
<a name="Mk 16:3"></a><span class="versenum">3</span> They had been asking each other, &#8220;Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb?&#8221;

<a name="Mk 16:6"></a><span class="versenum">6</span> But he said to them, &#8220;Do not be alarmed.

<a name="Mk 16:7"></a><span class="versenum">7</span> But go, tell his disciples, even Peter, that he is going ahead of you into Galilee. You will see him there, just as he told you.&#8221;

<a name="Mk 16:9"></a><span class="versenum">9</span> Early on the first day of the week, after he arose, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had driven out seven demons. 
<a name="Mk 16:10"></a><span class="versenum">10</span> She went out and told those who were with him, while they were mourning and weeping.

<a name="Mk 16:14"></a><span class="versenum">14</span> Then he appeared to the eleven themselves, while they were eating, and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who had seen him resurrected. 
<a name="Mk 16:15"></a><span class="versenum">15</span> He said to them, &#8220;Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.
