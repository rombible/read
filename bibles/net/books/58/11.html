<a name="Heb 11:5"></a><span class="versenum">5</span> By faith Enoch was taken up so that he did not see death, and he was not to be found because God took him up. For before his removal he had been commended as having pleased God. 
<a name="Heb 11:6"></a><span class="versenum">6</span> Now without faith it is impossible to please him, for the one who approaches God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him. 
<a name="Heb 11:7"></a><span class="versenum">7</span> By faith Noah, when he was warned about things not yet seen, with reverent regard<a onclick=vOpenNote(58,11,118) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,58,11,118) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,58,11,118) ><SUP>8</SUP></A> constructed an ark for the deliverance of his family.

<a name="Heb 11:10"></a><span class="versenum">10</span> For he was looking forward to the city with firm foundations,<a onclick=vOpenNote(58,11,1111) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,58,11,1111) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,58,11,1111) ><SUP>11</SUP></A> whose architect and builder is God.

<a name="Heb 11:14"></a><span class="versenum">14</span> For those who speak in such a way make it clear that they are seeking a homeland. 
<a name="Heb 11:15"></a><span class="versenum">15</span> In fact, if they had been thinking of the land that they had left, they would have had opportunity to return.

<a name="Heb 11:27"></a><span class="versenum">27</span> By faith he left Egypt without fearing the king&#8217;s anger, for he persevered as though he could see the one who is invisible.
