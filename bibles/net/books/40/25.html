<a name="Mt 25:4"></a><span class="versenum">4</span> But the wise ones took flasks of olive oil with their lamps.

<a name="Mt 25:6"></a><span class="versenum">6</span> But at midnight there was a shout, &#8216;Look, the bridegroom is here! Come out to meet him.&#8217;<a onclick=vOpenNote(40,25,257) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,40,25,257) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,40,25,257) ><SUP>7</SUP></A> 
<a name="Mt 25:7"></a><span class="versenum">7</span> Then all the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps. 
<a name="Mt 25:8"></a><span class="versenum">8</span> The<a onclick=vOpenNote(40,25,258) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,40,25,258) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,40,25,258) ><SUP>8</SUP></A> foolish ones said to the wise, &#8216;Give us some of your oil, because our lamps are going out.&#8217; 
<a name="Mt 25:9"></a><span class="versenum">9</span> &#8216;No,&#8217; they replied.<a onclick=vOpenNote(40,25,259) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,40,25,259) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,40,25,259) ><SUP>9</SUP></A> &#8216;There won&#8217;t be enough for you and for us.

<a name="Mt 25:10"></a><span class="versenum">10</span> But while they had gone to buy it, the bridegroom arrived, and those who were ready went inside with him to the wedding banquet.

<a name="Mt 25:11"></a><span class="versenum">11</span> Later,<a onclick=vOpenNote(40,25,2511) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,40,25,2511) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,40,25,2511) ><SUP>11</SUP></A> the other virgins came too, saying, &#8216;Lord, lord!

<a name="Mt 25:12"></a><span class="versenum">12</span> But he replied,<a onclick=vOpenNote(40,25,2513) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,40,25,2513) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,40,25,2513) ><SUP>13</SUP></A> &#8216;I tell you the truth,<a onclick=vOpenNote(40,25,2514) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,40,25,2514) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,40,25,2514) ><SUP>14</SUP></A> I do not know you!&#8217; 
<a name="Mt 25:13"></a><span class="versenum">13</span> Therefore stay alert, because you do not know the day or the hour.<a onclick=vOpenNote(40,25,2515) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,40,25,2515) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,40,25,2515) ><SUP>15</SUP></A></p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">The Parable of the Talents </p><p class="bodytext">
<a name="Mt 25:14"></a><span class="versenum">14</span> &#8220;For it is like a man going on a journey, who summoned his slaves<a onclick=vOpenNote(40,25,2516) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,40,25,2516) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,40,25,2516) ><SUP>16</SUP></A> and entrusted his property to them.

Then he went on his journey. 
<a name="Mt 25:16"></a><span class="versenum">16</span> The one who had received five talents went off right away and put his money to work<a onclick=vOpenNote(40,25,2519) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,40,25,2519) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,40,25,2519) ><SUP>19</SUP></A> and gained five more. 
<a name="Mt 25:17"></a><span class="versenum">17</span> In the same way, the one who had two gained two more. 
<a name="Mt 25:18"></a><span class="versenum">18</span> But the one who had received one talent went out and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master&#8217;s money in it. 
<a name="Mt 25:19"></a><span class="versenum">19</span> After<a onclick=vOpenNote(40,25,2520) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,40,25,2520) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,40,25,2520) ><SUP>20</SUP></A> a long time, the master of those slaves came and settled his accounts with them.

See, I have gained five more.&#8217; 
<a name="Mt 25:21"></a><span class="versenum">21</span> His master answered,<a onclick=vOpenNote(40,25,2523) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,40,25,2523) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,40,25,2523) ><SUP>23</SUP></A> &#8216;Well done, good and faithful slave! You have been faithful in a few things. I will put you in charge of many things. Enter into the joy of your master.&#8217;

<a name="Mt 25:23"></a><span class="versenum">23</span> His master answered, &#8216;Well done, good and faithful slave! You have been faithful with a few things. I will put you in charge of many things. Enter into the joy of your master.&#8217; 
<a name="Mt 25:24"></a><span class="versenum">24</span> Then the one who had received the one talent came and said, &#8216;Sir, I knew that you were a hard man, harvesting where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter seed, 
<a name="Mt 25:25"></a><span class="versenum">25</span> so<a onclick=vOpenNote(40,25,2525) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,40,25,2525) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,40,25,2525) ><SUP>25</SUP></A> I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the ground. See, you have what is yours.&#8217; 
<a name="Mt 25:26"></a><span class="versenum">26</span> But his master answered,<a onclick=vOpenNote(40,25,2526) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,40,25,2526) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,40,25,2526) ><SUP>26</SUP></A> &#8216;Evil and lazy slave! So you knew that I harvest where I didn&#8217;t sow and gather where I didn&#8217;t scatter? 
<a name="Mt 25:27"></a><span class="versenum">27</span> Then you should have deposited my money with the bankers,<a onclick=vOpenNote(40,25,2527) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,40,25,2527) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,40,25,2527) ><SUP>27</SUP></A> and on my return I would have received my money back with interest!<a onclick=vOpenNote(40,25,2528) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,40,25,2528) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,40,25,2528) ><SUP>28</SUP></A> 
<a name="Mt 25:28"></a><span class="versenum">28</span> Therefore take the talent from him and give it to the one who has ten.<a onclick=vOpenNote(40,25,2529) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,40,25,2529) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,40,25,2529) ><SUP>29</SUP></A> 
<a name="Mt 25:29"></a><span class="versenum">29</span> For the one who has will be given more,<a onclick=vOpenNote(40,25,2530) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,40,25,2530) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,40,25,2530) ><SUP>30</SUP></A> and he will have more than enough.
