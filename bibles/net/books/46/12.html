<a name="1Co 12:2"></a><span class="versenum">2</span> You know that when you were pagans you were often led astray by speechless idols, however you were led. 
<a name="1Co 12:3"></a><span class="versenum">3</span> So I want you to understand that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, &#8220;Jesus is cursed,&#8221; and no one can say, &#8220;Jesus is Lord,&#8221; except by the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Co 12:4"></a><span class="versenum">4</span> Now there are different gifts, but the same Spirit. 
<a name="1Co 12:5"></a><span class="versenum">5</span> And there are different ministries, but the same Lord. 
<a name="1Co 12:6"></a><span class="versenum">6</span> And there are different results, but the same God who produces all of them in everyone. 
<a name="1Co 12:7"></a><span class="versenum">7</span> To each person the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the benefit of all. 
<a name="1Co 12:8"></a><span class="versenum">8</span> For one person is given through the Spirit the message of wisdom, and another the message of knowledge according to the same Spirit, 
<a name="1Co 12:9"></a><span class="versenum">9</span> to another faith by the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit, 
<a name="1Co 12:10"></a><span class="versenum">10</span> to another performance of miracles, to another prophecy, and to another discernment of spirits, to another different kinds of tongues, and to another the interpretation of tongues. 
<a name="1Co 12:11"></a><span class="versenum">11</span> It is one and the same Spirit, distributing as he decides to each person, who produces all these things.</p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Different Members in One Body</p><p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Co 12:12"></a><span class="versenum">12</span> For just as the body is one and yet has many members, and all the members of the body &#8211; though many &#8211; are one body, so too is Christ. 
<a name="1Co 12:13"></a><span class="versenum">13</span> For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body. Whether Jews or Greeks or slaves<a onclick=vOpenNote(46,12,124) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,46,12,124) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,46,12,124) ><SUP>4</SUP></A> or free, we were all made to drink of the one Spirit. 
<a name="1Co 12:14"></a><span class="versenum">14</span> For in fact the body is not a single member, but many. 
<a name="1Co 12:15"></a><span class="versenum">15</span> If the foot says, &#8220;Since I am not a hand, I am not part of the body,&#8221; it does not lose its membership in the body because of that. 
<a name="1Co 12:16"></a><span class="versenum">16</span> And if the ear says, &#8220;Since I am not an eye, I am not part of the body,&#8221; it does not lose its membership in the body because of that. 
<a name="1Co 12:17"></a><span class="versenum">17</span> If the whole body were an eye, what part would do the hearing? If the whole were an ear, what part would exercise the sense of smell? 
<a name="1Co 12:18"></a><span class="versenum">18</span> But as a matter of fact, God has placed each of the members in the body just as he decided. 
<a name="1Co 12:19"></a><span class="versenum">19</span> If they were all the same member, where would the body be? 
<a name="1Co 12:20"></a><span class="versenum">20</span> So now there are many members, but one body. 
<a name="1Co 12:21"></a><span class="versenum">21</span> The eye cannot say to the hand, &#8220;I do not need you,&#8221; nor in turn can the head say to the foot, &#8220;I do not need you.&#8221; 
<a name="1Co 12:22"></a><span class="versenum">22</span> On the contrary, those members that seem to be weaker are essential, 
<a name="1Co 12:23"></a><span class="versenum">23</span> and those members we consider less honorable we clothe with greater honor, and our unpresentable members are clothed with dignity,<a onclick=vOpenNote(46,12,125) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,46,12,125) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,46,12,125) ><SUP>5</SUP></A> 
<a name="1Co 12:24"></a><span class="versenum">24</span> but our presentable members do not need this. Instead, God has blended together the body, giving greater honor to the lesser member, 
<a name="1Co 12:25"></a><span class="versenum">25</span> so that there may be no division in the body, but the members may have mutual concern for one another. 
<a name="1Co 12:26"></a><span class="versenum">26</span> If one member suffers, everyone suffers with it. If a<a onclick=vOpenNote(46,12,126) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,46,12,126) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,46,12,126) ><SUP>6</SUP></A> member is honored, all rejoice with it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Co 12:27"></a><span class="versenum">27</span> Now you are Christ&#8217;s body, and each of you is a member of it. 
<a name="1Co 12:28"></a><span class="versenum">28</span> And God has placed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, gifts of healing, helps, gifts of leadership, different kinds of tongues. 
<a name="1Co 12:29"></a><span class="versenum">29</span> Not all are apostles, are they? Not all are prophets, are they? Not all are teachers, are they? Not all perform miracles, do they? 
<a name="1Co 12:30"></a><span class="versenum">30</span> Not all have gifts of healing, do they? Not all speak in tongues, do they? Not all interpret, do they?<a onclick=vOpenNote(46,12,127) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,46,12,127) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,46,12,127) ><SUP>7</SUP></A> 
<a name="1Co 12:31"></a><span class="versenum">31</span> But you should be eager for the greater gifts.</p>
<p class="bodytext">And now I will show you a way that is beyond comparison.<a onclick=vOpenNote(46,12,128) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,46,12,128) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,46,12,128) ><SUP>8</SUP></A></p>
