<p class=bodytext><p class="paragraphtitle">The Apostles&#8217; Ministry</p><p class="bodytext"><a name="1Co 4:1"></a><span class="versenum">1</span> One<a onclick=vOpenNote(46,4,41) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,46,4,41) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,46,4,41) ><SUP>1</SUP></A> should think about us this way &#8211; as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God. 
<a name="1Co 4:2"></a><span class="versenum">2</span> Now what is sought in stewards is that one be found faithful. 
<a name="1Co 4:3"></a><span class="versenum">3</span> So for me, it is a minor matter that I am judged by you or by any human court. In fact, I do not even judge myself. 
<a name="1Co 4:4"></a><span class="versenum">4</span> For I am not aware of anything against myself, but I am not acquitted because of this. The one who judges me is the Lord. 
<a name="1Co 4:5"></a><span class="versenum">5</span> So then, do not judge anything before the time. Wait until the Lord comes. He will<a onclick=vOpenNote(46,4,42) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,46,4,42) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,46,4,42) ><SUP>2</SUP></A> bring to light the hidden things of darkness and reveal the motives of hearts. Then each will receive recognition<a onclick=vOpenNote(46,4,43) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,46,4,43) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,46,4,43) ><SUP>3</SUP></A> from God.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Co 4:6"></a><span class="versenum">6</span> I have applied these things to myself and Apollos because of you, brothers and sisters,<a onclick=vOpenNote(46,4,44) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,46,4,44) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,46,4,44) ><SUP>4</SUP></A> so that through us you may learn &#8220;not to go beyond what is written,&#8221; so that none of you will be puffed up in favor of the one against the other. 
<a name="1Co 4:7"></a><span class="versenum">7</span> For who concedes you any superiority? What do you have that you did not receive? And if you received it, why do you boast as though you did not? 
<a name="1Co 4:8"></a><span class="versenum">8</span> Already you are satisfied! Already you are rich! You have become kings without us! I wish you had become kings so that we could reign with you! 
<a name="1Co 4:9"></a><span class="versenum">9</span> For, I think, God has exhibited us apostles last of all, as men condemned to die, because we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to people. 
<a name="1Co 4:10"></a><span class="versenum">10</span> We are fools for Christ, but you are wise in Christ! We are weak, but you are strong! You are distinguished, we are dishonored! 
<a name="1Co 4:11"></a><span class="versenum">11</span> To the present hour we are hungry and thirsty, poorly clothed, brutally treated, and without a roof over our heads. 
<a name="1Co 4:12"></a><span class="versenum">12</span> We do hard work, toiling with our own hands. When we are verbally abused, we respond with a blessing, when persecuted, we endure, 
<a name="1Co 4:13"></a><span class="versenum">13</span> when people lie about us, we answer in a friendly manner. We are the world&#8217;s dirt and scum, even now.</p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">A Father&#8217;s Warning</p><p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Co 4:14"></a><span class="versenum">14</span> I am not writing these things to shame you, but to correct you as my dear children. 
<a name="1Co 4:15"></a><span class="versenum">15</span> For though you may have ten thousand guardians in Christ, you do not have many fathers, because I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel. 
<a name="1Co 4:16"></a><span class="versenum">16</span> I encourage you, then, be imitators of me. 
<a name="1Co 4:17"></a><span class="versenum">17</span> For this reason, I have sent Timothy to you, who is my dear and faithful son in the Lord. He will remind you of my ways in Christ,<a onclick=vOpenNote(46,4,45) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,46,4,45) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,46,4,45) ><SUP>5</SUP></A> as I teach them everywhere in every church. 
<a name="1Co 4:18"></a><span class="versenum">18</span> Some have become arrogant,<a onclick=vOpenNote(46,4,46) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,46,4,46) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,46,4,46) ><SUP>6</SUP></A> as if I were not coming to you. 
<a name="1Co 4:19"></a><span class="versenum">19</span> But I will come to you soon, if the Lord is willing, and I will find out not only the talk of these arrogant people, but also their power. 
<a name="1Co 4:20"></a><span class="versenum">20</span> For the kingdom of God is demonstrated not in idle talk but with power. 
<a name="1Co 4:21"></a><span class="versenum">21</span> What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod of discipline<a onclick=vOpenNote(46,4,47) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,46,4,47) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,46,4,47) ><SUP>7</SUP></A> or with love and a spirit of gentleness?</p>
