<p class=bodytext><p class="paragraphtitle">The Rights of an Apostle</p><p class="bodytext"><a name="1Co 9:1"></a><span class="versenum">1</span> Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord? 
<a name="1Co 9:2"></a><span class="versenum">2</span> If I am not an apostle to others, at least I am to you, for you are the confirming sign<a onclick=vOpenNote(46,9,91) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,46,9,91) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,46,9,91) ><SUP>1</SUP></A> of my apostleship in the Lord. 
<a name="1Co 9:3"></a><span class="versenum">3</span> This is my defense to those who examine me. 
<a name="1Co 9:4"></a><span class="versenum">4</span> Do we not have the right to financial support?<a onclick=vOpenNote(46,9,92) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,46,9,92) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,46,9,92) ><SUP>2</SUP></A> 
<a name="1Co 9:5"></a><span class="versenum">5</span> Do we not have the right to the company of a believing wife, like the other apostles and the Lord&#8217;s brothers and Cephas? 
<a name="1Co 9:6"></a><span class="versenum">6</span> Or do only Barnabas and I lack the right not to work? 
<a name="1Co 9:7"></a><span class="versenum">7</span> Who ever serves in the army at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat its fruit? Who tends a flock and does not consume its milk? 
<a name="1Co 9:8"></a><span class="versenum">8</span> Am I saying these things only on the basis of common sense,<a onclick=vOpenNote(46,9,93) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,46,9,93) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,46,9,93) ><SUP>3</SUP></A> or does the law not say this as well? 
<a name="1Co 9:9"></a><span class="versenum">9</span> For it is written in the law of Moses, &#8220;<b><i>Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain</i></b>.&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(46,9,94) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,46,9,94) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,46,9,94) ><SUP>4</SUP></A> God is not concerned here about oxen, is he? 
<a name="1Co 9:10"></a><span class="versenum">10</span> Or is he not surely speaking for our benefit? It was written for us, because the one plowing and threshing ought to work in hope of enjoying the harvest. 
<a name="1Co 9:11"></a><span class="versenum">11</span> If we sowed spiritual blessings among you, is it too much to reap material things from you? 
<a name="1Co 9:12"></a><span class="versenum">12</span> If others receive this right from you, are we not more deserving?</p>
<p class="bodytext">But we have not made use of this right. Instead we endure everything so that we may not be a hindrance to the gospel of Christ. 
<a name="1Co 9:13"></a><span class="versenum">13</span> Don&#8217;t you know that those who serve in the temple<a onclick=vOpenNote(46,9,95) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,46,9,95) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,46,9,95) ><SUP>5</SUP></A> eat food from the temple, and those who serve at the altar receive a part of the offerings? 
<a name="1Co 9:14"></a><span class="versenum">14</span> In the same way the Lord commanded those who proclaim the gospel to receive their living by the gospel. 
<a name="1Co 9:15"></a><span class="versenum">15</span> But I have not used any of these rights. And I am not writing these things so that something will be done for me.<a onclick=vOpenNote(46,9,96) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,46,9,96) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,46,9,96) ><SUP>6</SUP></A> In fact, it would be better for me to die than &#8211; no one will deprive me of my reason for boasting!<a onclick=vOpenNote(46,9,97) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,46,9,97) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,46,9,97) ><SUP>7</SUP></A> 
<a name="1Co 9:16"></a><span class="versenum">16</span> For if I preach the gospel, I have no reason for boasting, because I am compelled to do this. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel! 
<a name="1Co 9:17"></a><span class="versenum">17</span> For if I do this voluntarily, I have a reward. But if I do it unwillingly, I am entrusted with a responsibility. 
<a name="1Co 9:18"></a><span class="versenum">18</span> What then is my reward? That when I preach the gospel I may offer the gospel free of charge, and so not make full use of my rights in the gospel.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Co 9:19"></a><span class="versenum">19</span> For since I am free from all I can make myself a slave to all, in order to gain even more people.<a onclick=vOpenNote(46,9,98) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,46,9,98) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,46,9,98) ><SUP>8</SUP></A> 
<a name="1Co 9:20"></a><span class="versenum">20</span> To the Jews I became like a Jew to gain the Jews. To those under the law I became like one under the law (though I myself am not under the law)<a onclick=vOpenNote(46,9,99) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,46,9,99) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,46,9,99) ><SUP>9</SUP></A> to gain those under the law. 
<a name="1Co 9:21"></a><span class="versenum">21</span> To those free from the law I became like one free from the law (though I am not free from God&#8217;s law but under the law of Christ) to gain those free from the law. 
<a name="1Co 9:22"></a><span class="versenum">22</span> To the weak I became weak in order to gain the weak. I have become all things to all people, so that by all means I may save some.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Co 9:23"></a><span class="versenum">23</span> I do all these things because of the gospel, so that I can be a participant in it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Co 9:24"></a><span class="versenum">24</span> Do you not know that all the runners in a stadium compete, but only one receives the prize? So run to win. 
<a name="1Co 9:25"></a><span class="versenum">25</span> Each competitor must exercise self-control in everything. They do it to receive a perishable crown, but we an imperishable one.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="1Co 9:26"></a><span class="versenum">26</span> So I do not run uncertainly or box like one who hits only air. 
<a name="1Co 9:27"></a><span class="versenum">27</span> Instead I subdue my body and make it my slave, so that after preaching to others I myself will not be disqualified.</p>
