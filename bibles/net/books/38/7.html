<p class=bodytext><p class="paragraphtitle">The Hypocrisy of False Fasting</p><p class="bodytext"><a name="Zec 7:1"></a><span class="versenum">1</span> In King Darius&#8217; fourth year, on the fourth day of <i>Kislev</i>, the ninth month,<a onclick=vOpenNote(38,7,71) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,38,7,71) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,38,7,71) ><SUP>1</SUP></A> the word of the <sc>Lord came to Zechariah. 
<a name="Zec 7:2"></a><span class="versenum">2</span> Now the people of Bethel<a onclick=vOpenNote(38,7,72) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,38,7,72) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,38,7,72) ><SUP>2</SUP></A> had sent Sharezer and Regem-Melech and their companions to seek the <sc>Lord&#8217;s favor 
<a name="Zec 7:3"></a><span class="versenum">3</span> by asking both the priests of the temple<a onclick=vOpenNote(38,7,73) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,38,7,73) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,38,7,73) ><SUP>3</SUP></A> of the <sc>Lord who rules over all and the prophets, &#8220;Should we weep in the fifth month,<a onclick=vOpenNote(38,7,74) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,38,7,74) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,38,7,74) ><SUP>4</SUP></A> fasting as we have done over the years?&#8221; 
<a name="Zec 7:4"></a><span class="versenum">4</span> The word of the <sc>Lord who rules over all then came to me, 
<a name="Zec 7:5"></a><span class="versenum">5</span> &#8220;Speak to all the people and priests of the land as follows: &#8216;When you fasted and lamented in the fifth and seventh<a onclick=vOpenNote(38,7,75) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,38,7,75) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,38,7,75) ><SUP>5</SUP></A> months through all these seventy years, did you truly fast for me &#8211; for me, indeed? 
<a name="Zec 7:6"></a><span class="versenum">6</span> And now when you eat and drink, are you not doing so for yourselves?&#8217;&#8221; 
<a name="Zec 7:7"></a><span class="versenum">7</span> Should you not have obeyed the words that the <sc>Lord cried out through the former prophets when Jerusalem<a onclick=vOpenNote(38,7,76) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,38,7,76) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,38,7,76) ><SUP>6</SUP></A> was peacefully inhabited and her surrounding cities, the Negev, and the Shephelah<a onclick=vOpenNote(38,7,77) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,38,7,77) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,38,7,77) ><SUP>7</SUP></A> were also populated?</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Zec 7:8"></a><span class="versenum">8</span> Again the word of the <sc>Lord came to Zechariah: 
<a name="Zec 7:9"></a><span class="versenum">9</span> &#8220;The <sc>Lord who rules over all said, &#8216;Exercise true judgment and show brotherhood and compassion to each other. 
<a name="Zec 7:10"></a><span class="versenum">10</span> You must not oppress the widow, the orphan, the foreigner, or the poor, nor should anyone secretly plot evil against his fellow human being.&#8217;</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Zec 7:11"></a><span class="versenum">11</span> &#8220;But they refused to pay attention, turning away stubbornly and stopping their ears so they could not hear. 
<a name="Zec 7:12"></a><span class="versenum">12</span> Indeed, they made their heart as hard as diamond,<a onclick=vOpenNote(38,7,78) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,38,7,78) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,38,7,78) ><SUP>8</SUP></A> so that they could not obey the Torah and the other words the <sc>Lord who rules over all had sent by his Spirit through the former prophets. Therefore, the <sc>Lord who rules over all had poured out great wrath.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Zec 7:13"></a><span class="versenum">13</span> &#8220;&#8216;It then came about that just as I<a onclick=vOpenNote(38,7,79) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,38,7,79) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,38,7,79) ><SUP>9</SUP></A> cried out, but they would not obey, so they will cry out, but I will not listen,&#8217; the <sc>Lord <sc>Lord who rules over all had said. 
<a name="Zec 7:14"></a><span class="versenum">14</span> &#8216;Rather, I will sweep them away in a storm into all the nations they are not familiar with.&#8217; Thus the land had become desolate because of them, with no one crossing through or returning, for they had made the fruitful<a onclick=vOpenNote(38,7,710) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,38,7,710) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,38,7,710) ><SUP>10</SUP></A> land a waste.&#8221;</p>
