<p class=bodytext><p class="paragraphtitle">The Blessing of True Fasting</p><p class="bodytext"><a name="Zec 8:1"></a><span class="versenum">1</span> Then the word of the <sc>Lord who rules over all<a onclick=vOpenNote(38,8,81) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,38,8,81) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,38,8,81) ><SUP>1</SUP></A> came to me as follows: 
<a name="Zec 8:2"></a><span class="versenum">2</span> &#8220;The <sc>Lord who rules over all says, &#8216;I am very much concerned for Zion; indeed, I am so concerned for her that my rage will fall on those who hurt her.&#8217; 
<a name="Zec 8:3"></a><span class="versenum">3</span> The Lord says, &#8216;I have returned to Zion and will live within Jerusalem.<a onclick=vOpenNote(38,8,82) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,38,8,82) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,38,8,82) ><SUP>2</SUP></A> Now Jerusalem will be called &#8220;truthful city,&#8221; &#8220;mountain of the <sc>Lord who rules over all,&#8221; &#8220;holy mountain.&#8221;&#8217; 
<a name="Zec 8:4"></a><span class="versenum">4</span> Moreover, the <sc>Lord who rules over all says, &#8216;Old men and women will once more live in the plazas of Jerusalem, each one leaning on a cane because of advanced age. 
<a name="Zec 8:5"></a><span class="versenum">5</span> And the streets of the city will be full of boys and girls playing.<a onclick=vOpenNote(38,8,83) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,38,8,83) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,38,8,83) ><SUP>3</SUP></A> 
<a name="Zec 8:6"></a><span class="versenum">6</span> And,&#8217; says the <sc>Lord who rules over all, &#8216;though such a thing may seem to be difficult in the opinion of the small community of those days, will it also appear difficult to me?&#8217; asks the <sc>Lord who rules over all.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Zec 8:7"></a><span class="versenum">7</span> &#8220;The <sc>Lord who rules over all asserts, &#8216;I am about to save my people from the lands of the east and the west. 
<a name="Zec 8:8"></a><span class="versenum">8</span> And I will bring them to settle within Jerusalem. They will be my people, and I will be their God,<a onclick=vOpenNote(38,8,84) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,38,8,84) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,38,8,84) ><SUP>4</SUP></A> in truth and righteousness.&#8217;</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Zec 8:9"></a><span class="versenum">9</span> &#8220;The <sc>Lord who rules over all also says, &#8216;Gather strength, you who are listening to these words today from the mouths of the prophets who were there at the founding of the house of the <sc>Lord who rules over all,<a onclick=vOpenNote(38,8,85) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,38,8,85) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,38,8,85) ><SUP>5</SUP></A> so that the temple might be built. 
<a name="Zec 8:10"></a><span class="versenum">10</span> Before that time there was no compensation for man or animal, nor was there any relief from adversity for those who came and went, because I had pitted everybody &#8211; each one &#8211; against everyone else. 
<a name="Zec 8:11"></a><span class="versenum">11</span> But I will be different now to this remnant of my people from the way I was in those days,&#8217; says the <sc>Lord who rules over all, 
<a name="Zec 8:12"></a><span class="versenum">12</span> &#8216;for there will be a peaceful time of sowing, the vine will produce its fruit and the ground its yield, and the skies<a onclick=vOpenNote(38,8,86) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,38,8,86) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,38,8,86) ><SUP>6</SUP></A> will rain down dew. Then I will allow the remnant of my people to possess all these things. 
<a name="Zec 8:13"></a><span class="versenum">13</span> And it will come about that just as you (both Judah and Israel) were a curse to the nations, so I will save you and you will be a blessing. Do not be afraid! Instead, be strong!&#8217;</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Zec 8:14"></a><span class="versenum">14</span> &#8220;For the <sc>Lord who rules over all says, &#8216;As I had planned to hurt<a onclick=vOpenNote(38,8,87) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,38,8,87) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,38,8,87) ><SUP>7</SUP></A> you when your fathers made me angry,&#8217; says the <sc>Lord who rules over all, &#8216;and I was not sorry, 
<a name="Zec 8:15"></a><span class="versenum">15</span> so, to the contrary, I have planned in these days to do good to Jerusalem and Judah &#8211; do not fear! 
<a name="Zec 8:16"></a><span class="versenum">16</span> These are the things you must do: Speak the truth, each of you, to one another. Practice true and righteous judgment in your courts.<a onclick=vOpenNote(38,8,88) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,38,8,88) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,38,8,88) ><SUP>8</SUP></A> 
<a name="Zec 8:17"></a><span class="versenum">17</span> Do not plan evil in your hearts against one another. Do not favor a false oath &#8211; these are all things that I hate,&#8217; says the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Zec 8:18"></a><span class="versenum">18</span> The word of the <sc>Lord who rules over all came to me as follows: 
<a name="Zec 8:19"></a><span class="versenum">19</span> &#8220;The <sc>Lord who rules over all says, &#8216;The fast of the fourth, fifth, seventh, and tenth<a onclick=vOpenNote(38,8,89) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,38,8,89) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,38,8,89) ><SUP>9</SUP></A> months will become joyful and happy, pleasant feasts for the house of Judah, so love truth and peace.&#8217; 
<a name="Zec 8:20"></a><span class="versenum">20</span> The <sc>Lord who rules over all says, &#8216;It will someday come to pass that people &#8211; residents of many cities &#8211; will come. 
<a name="Zec 8:21"></a><span class="versenum">21</span> The inhabitants of one will go to another and say, &#8220;Let&#8217;s go up at once to ask the favor of the <sc>Lord, to seek the <sc>Lord who rules over all. Indeed, I&#8217;ll go with you.&#8221;&#8217; 
<a name="Zec 8:22"></a><span class="versenum">22</span> Many peoples and powerful nations will come to Jerusalem to seek the <sc>Lord who rules over all and to ask his favor. 
<a name="Zec 8:23"></a><span class="versenum">23</span> The <sc>Lord who rules over all says, &#8216;In those days ten people from all languages and nations will grasp hold of &#8211; indeed, grab &#8211; the robe of one Jew and say, &#8220;Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.&#8221;&#8217;&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(38,8,810) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,38,8,810) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,38,8,810) ><SUP>10</SUP></A></p>
