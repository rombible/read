This army consisted of troops from his own army and from the kingdoms and peoples of the lands under his dominion.<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,34,342) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,34,342) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,34,342) ><SUP>2</SUP></A> 
<a name="Je 34:2"></a><span class="versenum">2</span> The <sc>Lord God of Israel told Jeremiah<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,34,343) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,34,343) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,34,343) ><SUP>3</SUP></A> to go and give King Zedekiah of Judah a message. He told Jeremiah<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,34,344) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,34,344) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,34,344) ><SUP>4</SUP></A> to tell him, &#8220;The <sc>Lord says, &#8216;I am going to<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,34,345) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,34,345) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,34,345) ><SUP>5</SUP></A> hand this city over to the king of Babylon and he will burn it down. 
<a name="Je 34:3"></a><span class="versenum">3</span> You yourself will not escape his clutches, but will certainly be captured and handed over to him.

<a name="Je 34:4"></a><span class="versenum">4</span> However, listen to what I, the <sc>Lord, promise you, King Zedekiah of Judah. I, the <sc>Lord, promise that<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,34,347) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,34,347) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,34,347) ><SUP>7</SUP></A> you will not die in battle or be executed.<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,34,348) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,34,348) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,34,348) ><SUP>8</SUP></A> 
<a name="Je 34:5"></a><span class="versenum">5</span> You will die a peaceful death.

<a name="Je 34:6"></a><span class="versenum">6</span> The prophet Jeremiah told all this to King Zedekiah of Judah in Jerusalem. 
<a name="Je 34:7"></a><span class="versenum">7</span> He did this while the army of the king of Babylon was attacking Jerusalem and the cities of Lachish and Azekah. He was attacking these cities because they were the only fortified cities of Judah which were still holding out.<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,34,3413) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,34,3413) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,34,3413) ><SUP>13</SUP></A></p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">The Lord Threatens to Destroy Those Who Wronged Their Slaves</p><p class="bodytext">
<a name="Je 34:8"></a><span class="versenum">8</span> The <sc>Lord spoke to Jeremiah after King Zedekiah had made a covenant<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,34,3414) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,34,3414) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,34,3414) ><SUP>14</SUP></A> with all the people in Jerusalem<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,34,3415) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,34,3415) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,34,3415) ><SUP>15</SUP></A> to grant their slaves their freedom. 
<a name="Je 34:9"></a><span class="versenum">9</span> Everyone was supposed to free their male and female Hebrew slaves. No one was supposed to keep a fellow Judean enslaved.<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,34,3416) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,34,3416) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,34,3416) ><SUP>16</SUP></A> 
<a name="Je 34:10"></a><span class="versenum">10</span> All the people and their leaders had agreed to this. They had agreed to free their male and female slaves and not keep them enslaved any longer. They originally complied with the covenant and freed them.<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,34,3417) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,34,3417) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,34,3417) ><SUP>17</SUP></A> 
<a name="Je 34:11"></a><span class="versenum">11</span> But later<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,34,3418) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,34,3418) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,34,3418) ><SUP>18</SUP></A> they had changed their minds. They had taken back their male and female slaves that they had freed and forced them to be slaves again.<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,34,3419) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,34,3419) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,34,3419) ><SUP>19</SUP></A> 
<a name="Je 34:12"></a><span class="versenum">12</span> That was when the <sc>Lord spoke to Jeremiah,<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,34,3420) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,34,3420) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,34,3420) ><SUP>20</SUP></A>

<a name="Je 34:14"></a><span class="versenum">14</span> &#8220;Every seven years each of you must free any fellow Hebrews who have sold themselves to you.

<a name="Je 34:15"></a><span class="versenum">15</span> Recently, however, you yourselves<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,34,3426) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,34,3426) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,34,3426) ><SUP>26</SUP></A> showed a change of heart and did what is pleasing to me. You granted your fellow countrymen their freedom and you made a covenant to that effect in my presence in the house that I have claimed for my own.<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,34,3427) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,34,3427) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,34,3427) ><SUP>27</SUP></A> 
<a name="Je 34:16"></a><span class="versenum">16</span> But then you turned right around<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,34,3428) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,34,3428) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,34,3428) ><SUP>28</SUP></A> and showed that you did not honor me.<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,34,3429) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,34,3429) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,34,3429) ><SUP>29</SUP></A> Each of you took back your male and female slaves whom you had freed as they desired, and you forced them to be your slaves again.<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,34,3430) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,34,3430) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,34,3430) ><SUP>30</SUP></A> 
<a name="Je 34:17"></a><span class="versenum">17</span> So I, the <sc>Lord, say: &#8220;You have not really obeyed me and granted freedom to your neighbor and fellow countryman.<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,34,3431) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,34,3431) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,34,3431) ><SUP>31</SUP></A> Therefore, I will grant you freedom, the freedom<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,34,3432) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,34,3432) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,34,3432) ><SUP>32</SUP></A> to die in war, or by starvation or disease. I, the <sc>Lord, affirm it!<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,34,3433) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,34,3433) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,34,3433) ><SUP>33</SUP></A> I will make all the kingdoms of the earth horrified at what happens to you.<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,34,3434) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,34,3434) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,34,3434) ><SUP>34</SUP></A> 
<a name="Je 34:18"></a><span class="versenum">18</span> I will punish those people who have violated their covenant with me.

<a name="Je 34:19"></a><span class="versenum">19</span> I will punish the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the court officials,<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,34,3437) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,34,3437) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,34,3437) ><SUP>37</SUP></A> the priests, and all the other people of the land who passed between the pieces of the calf.<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,34,3438) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,34,3438) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,34,3438) ><SUP>38</SUP></A> 
<a name="Je 34:20"></a><span class="versenum">20</span> I will hand them over to their enemies who want to kill them.

<a name="Je 34:21"></a><span class="versenum">21</span> I will also hand King Zedekiah of Judah and his officials over to their enemies who want to kill them. I will hand them over to the army of the king of Babylon, even though they have temporarily withdrawn from attacking you.<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,34,3440) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,34,3440) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,34,3440) ><SUP>40</SUP></A> 
<a name="Je 34:22"></a><span class="versenum">22</span> For I, the <sc>Lord, affirm that<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,34,3441) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,34,3441) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,34,3441) ><SUP>41</SUP></A> I will soon give the order and bring them back to this city.
