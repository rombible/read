While they were eating a meal together with him there at Mizpah, 
<a name="Je 41:2"></a><span class="versenum">2</span> Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the ten men who were with him stood up, pulled out their swords, and killed Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan. Thus Ishmael killed the man that the king of Babylon had appointed to govern the country. 
<a name="Je 41:3"></a><span class="versenum">3</span> Ishmael also killed all the Judeans<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,41,412) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,41,412) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,41,412) ><SUP>2</SUP></A> who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah and the Babylonian<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,41,413) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,41,413) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,41,413) ><SUP>3</SUP></A> soldiers who happened to be there.<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,41,414) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,41,414) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,41,414) ><SUP>4</SUP></A> </p>

<a name="Je 41:7"></a><span class="versenum">7</span> But as soon as they were inside the city, Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the men who were with him slaughtered them and threw their bodies<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,41,4110) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,41,4110) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,41,4110) ><SUP>10</SUP></A> in a cistern.

<a name="Je 41:10"></a><span class="versenum">10</span> Then Ishmael took captive all the people who were still left alive in Mizpah.

Ishmael son of Nethaniah took all these people captive and set out to cross over to the Ammonites.</p>

<a name="Je 41:12"></a><span class="versenum">12</span> So they took all their troops and went to fight against Ishmael son of Nethaniah. They caught up with him near the large pool<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,41,4120) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,41,4120) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,41,4120) ><SUP>20</SUP></A> at Gibeon.

<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Je 41:16"></a><span class="versenum">16</span> Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him led off all the people who had been left alive at Mizpah.
