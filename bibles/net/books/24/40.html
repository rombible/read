<a name="Je 40:2"></a><span class="versenum">2</span> The captain of the royal guard took Jeremiah aside and said to him, &#8220;The <sc>Lord your God threatened this place with this disaster. 
<a name="Je 40:3"></a><span class="versenum">3</span> Now he has brought it about. The <sc>Lord has done just as he threatened to do. This disaster has happened because you people sinned against the <sc>Lord and did not obey him.<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,40,405) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,40,405) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,40,405) ><SUP>5</SUP></A> 
<a name="Je 40:4"></a><span class="versenum">4</span> But now, Jeremiah, today I will set you free<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,40,406) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,40,406) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,40,406) ><SUP>6</SUP></A> from the chains on your wrists. If you would like to come to Babylon with me, come along and I will take care of you.<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,40,407) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,40,407) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,40,407) ><SUP>7</SUP></A> But if you prefer not to come to Babylon with me, you are not required to do so.<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,40,408) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,40,408) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,40,408) ><SUP>8</SUP></A> You are free to go anywhere in the land you want to go.<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,40,409) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,40,409) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,40,409) ><SUP>9</SUP></A> Go wherever you choose.&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,40,4010) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,40,4010) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,40,4010) ><SUP>10</SUP></A> 
<a name="Je 40:5"></a><span class="versenum">5</span> Before Jeremiah could turn to leave, the captain of the guard added, &#8220;Go back<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,40,4011) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,40,4011) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,40,4011) ><SUP>11</SUP></A> to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon appointed to govern<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,40,4012) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,40,4012) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,40,4012) ><SUP>12</SUP></A> the towns of Judah. Go back and live with him<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,40,4013) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,40,4013) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,40,4013) ><SUP>13</SUP></A> among the people. Or go wherever else you choose.&#8221; Then the captain of the guard gave Jeremiah some food and a present and let him go. 
<a name="Je 40:6"></a><span class="versenum">6</span> So Jeremiah went to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,40,4014) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,40,4014) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,40,4014) ><SUP>14</SUP></A> and lived there with him. He stayed there to live among the people who had been left in the land of Judah.<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,40,4015) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,40,4015) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,40,4015) ><SUP>15</SUP></A></p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">A Small Judean Province is Established at Mizpah</p><p class="bodytext">
<a name="Je 40:7"></a><span class="versenum">7</span> Now some of the officers of the Judean army and their troops had been hiding in the countryside. They heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam to govern<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,40,4016) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,40,4016) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,40,4016) ><SUP>16</SUP></A> the country. They also heard that he had been put in charge over the men, women, and children from the poorer classes of the land who had not been carried off into exile in Babylon.<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,40,4017) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,40,4017) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,40,4017) ><SUP>17</SUP></A> 
<a name="Je 40:8"></a><span class="versenum">8</span> So<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,40,4018) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,40,4018) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,40,4018) ><SUP>18</SUP></A> all these officers and their troops came to Gedaliah at Mizpah. The officers who came were Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah son of the Maacathite.<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,40,4019) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,40,4019) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,40,4019) ><SUP>19</SUP></A> 
<a name="Je 40:9"></a><span class="versenum">9</span> Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, took an oath so as to give them and their troops some assurance of safety.<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,40,4020) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,40,4020) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,40,4020) ><SUP>20</SUP></A> &#8220;Do not be afraid to submit to the Babylonians.<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,40,4021) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,40,4021) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,40,4021) ><SUP>21</SUP></A> Settle down in the land and submit to the king of Babylon. Then things will go well for you. 
<a name="Je 40:10"></a><span class="versenum">10</span> I for my part will stay at Mizpah to represent you before the Babylonians<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,40,4022) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,40,4022) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,40,4022) ><SUP>22</SUP></A> whenever they come to us. You for your part go ahead and harvest the wine, the dates, the figs,<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,40,4023) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,40,4023) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,40,4023) ><SUP>23</SUP></A> and the olive oil, and store them in jars. Go ahead and settle down in the towns that you have taken over.&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,40,4024) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,40,4024) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,40,4024) ><SUP>24</SUP></A> 
<a name="Je 40:11"></a><span class="versenum">11</span> Moreover, all the Judeans who were in Moab, Ammon, Edom, and all the other countries heard what had happened. They heard that the king of Babylon had allowed some people to stay in Judah and that he had appointed Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, to govern them. 
<a name="Je 40:12"></a><span class="versenum">12</span> So all these Judeans returned to the land of Judah from the places where they had been scattered. They came to Gedaliah at Mizpah. Thus they harvested a large amount of wine and dates and figs.<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,40,4025) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,40,4025) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,40,4025) ><SUP>25</SUP></A></p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Ishmael Murders Gedaliah and Carries the Judeans at Mizpah off as Captives</p><p class="bodytext">
<a name="Je 40:13"></a><span class="versenum">13</span> Johanan and all the officers of the troops that had been hiding in the open country came to Gedaliah at Mizpah. 
<a name="Je 40:14"></a><span class="versenum">14</span> They said to him, &#8220;Are you at all aware<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,40,4026) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,40,4026) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,40,4026) ><SUP>26</SUP></A> that King Baalis of Ammon has sent Ishmael son of Nethaniah to kill you?&#8221; But Gedaliah son of Ahikam would not believe them. 
<a name="Je 40:15"></a><span class="versenum">15</span> Then Johanan son of Kareah spoke privately to Gedaliah there at Mizpah, &#8220;Let me go and kill Ishmael the son of Nethaniah before anyone knows about it. Otherwise he will kill you<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,40,4027) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,40,4027) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,40,4027) ><SUP>27</SUP></A> and all the Judeans who have rallied around you will be scattered. Then what remains of Judah will disappear.&#8221; 
<a name="Je 40:16"></a><span class="versenum">16</span> But Gedaliah son of Ahikam said to Johanan son of Kareah, &#8220;Do not do that<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,40,4028) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,40,4028) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,40,4028) ><SUP>28</SUP></A> because what you are saying about Ishmael is not true.&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(24,40,4029) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,24,40,4029) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,24,40,4029) ><SUP>29</SUP></A></p>
