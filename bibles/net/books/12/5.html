But this great warrior had a skin disease.<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,5,52) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,5,52) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,5,52) ><SUP>2</SUP></A> 
<a name="2Ki 5:2"></a><span class="versenum">2</span> Raiding parties went out from Syria and took captive from the land of Israel a young girl, who became a servant to Naaman&#8217;s wife. 
<a name="2Ki 5:3"></a><span class="versenum">3</span> She told her mistress, &#8220;If only my master were in the presence of the prophet who is in Samaria!<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,5,53) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,5,53) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,5,53) ><SUP>3</SUP></A> Then he would cure him of his skin disease.&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Ki 5:4"></a><span class="versenum">4</span> Naaman<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,5,54) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,5,54) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,5,54) ><SUP>4</SUP></A> went and told his master what the girl from the land of Israel had said. 
<a name="2Ki 5:5"></a><span class="versenum">5</span> The king of Syria said, &#8220;Go! I will send a letter to the king of Israel.&#8221; So Naaman<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,5,55) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,5,55) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,5,55) ><SUP>5</SUP></A> went, taking with him ten talents<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,5,56) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,5,56) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,5,56) ><SUP>6</SUP></A> of silver, six thousand shekels of gold,<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,5,57) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,5,57) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,5,57) ><SUP>7</SUP></A> and ten suits of clothes. 
<a name="2Ki 5:6"></a><span class="versenum">6</span> He brought the letter to king of Israel. It read: &#8220;This is a letter of introduction for my servant Naaman,<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,5,58) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,5,58) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,5,58) ><SUP>8</SUP></A> whom I have sent to be cured of his skin disease.&#8221; 
<a name="2Ki 5:7"></a><span class="versenum">7</span> When the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes and said, &#8220;Am I God? Can I kill or restore life? Why does he ask me to cure a man of his skin disease?<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,5,59) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,5,59) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,5,59) ><SUP>9</SUP></A> Certainly you must see that he is looking for an excuse to fight me!&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,5,510) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,5,510) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,5,510) ><SUP>10</SUP></A></p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Ki 5:8"></a><span class="versenum">8</span> When Elisha the prophet<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,5,511) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,5,511) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,5,511) ><SUP>11</SUP></A> heard that the king had torn his clothes, he sent this message to the king, &#8220;Why did you tear your clothes? Send him<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,5,512) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,5,512) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,5,512) ><SUP>12</SUP></A> to me so he may know there is a prophet in Israel.&#8221; 
<a name="2Ki 5:9"></a><span class="versenum">9</span> So Naaman came with his horses and chariots and stood in the doorway of Elisha&#8217;s house. 
<a name="2Ki 5:10"></a><span class="versenum">10</span> Elisha sent out a messenger who told him, &#8220;Go and wash seven times in the Jordan; your skin will be restored<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,5,513) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,5,513) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,5,513) ><SUP>13</SUP></A> and you will be healed.&#8221; 
<a name="2Ki 5:11"></a><span class="versenum">11</span> Naaman went away angry. He said, &#8220;Look, I thought for sure he would come out, stand there, invoke the name of the <sc>Lord his God, wave his hand over the area, and cure the skin disease. 
<a name="2Ki 5:12"></a><span class="versenum">12</span> The rivers of Damascus, the Abana and Pharpar, are better than any of the waters of Israel!<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,5,514) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,5,514) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,5,514) ><SUP>14</SUP></A> Could I not wash in them and be healed?&#8221; So he turned around and went away angry. 
<a name="2Ki 5:13"></a><span class="versenum">13</span> His servants approached and said to him, &#8220;O master,<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,5,515) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,5,515) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,5,515) ><SUP>15</SUP></A> if the prophet had told you to do some difficult task,<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,5,516) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,5,516) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,5,516) ><SUP>16</SUP></A> you would have been willing to do it.<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,5,517) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,5,517) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,5,517) ><SUP>17</SUP></A> It seems you should be happy that he simply said, &#8220;Wash and you will be healed.&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,5,518) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,5,518) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,5,518) ><SUP>18</SUP></A> 
<a name="2Ki 5:14"></a><span class="versenum">14</span> So he went down and dipped in the Jordan seven times, as the prophet had instructed.<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,5,519) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,5,519) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,5,519) ><SUP>19</SUP></A> His skin became as smooth as a young child&#8217;s<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,5,520) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,5,520) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,5,520) ><SUP>20</SUP></A> and he was healed.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Ki 5:15"></a><span class="versenum">15</span> He and his entire entourage returned to the prophet. Naaman<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,5,521) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,5,521) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,5,521) ><SUP>21</SUP></A> came and stood before him. He said, &#8220;For sure<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,5,522) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,5,522) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,5,522) ><SUP>22</SUP></A> I know that there is no God in all the earth except in Israel! Now, please accept a gift from your servant.&#8221; 
<a name="2Ki 5:16"></a><span class="versenum">16</span> But Elisha<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,5,523) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,5,523) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,5,523) ><SUP>23</SUP></A> replied, &#8220;As certainly as the <sc>Lord lives (whom I serve),<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,5,524) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,5,524) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,5,524) ><SUP>24</SUP></A> I will take nothing from you.&#8221; Naaman<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,5,525) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,5,525) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,5,525) ><SUP>25</SUP></A> insisted that he take it, but he refused. 
<a name="2Ki 5:17"></a><span class="versenum">17</span> Naaman said, &#8220;If not, then please give your servant a load of dirt, enough for a pair of mules to carry,<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,5,526) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,5,526) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,5,526) ><SUP>26</SUP></A> for your servant will never again offer a burnt offering or sacrifice to a god other than the <sc>Lord.<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,5,527) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,5,527) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,5,527) ><SUP>27</SUP></A> 
<a name="2Ki 5:18"></a><span class="versenum">18</span> May the <sc>Lord forgive your servant for this one thing: When my master enters the temple of Rimmon to worship, and he leans on my arm and I bow down in the temple of Rimmon, may the <sc>Lord forgive your servant for this.&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,5,528) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,5,528) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,5,528) ><SUP>28</SUP></A> 
<a name="2Ki 5:19"></a><span class="versenum">19</span> Elisha<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,5,529) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,5,529) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,5,529) ><SUP>29</SUP></A> said to him, &#8220;Go in peace.&#8221; </p>
<p class="bodytext">When he had gone a short distance,<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,5,530) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,5,530) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,5,530) ><SUP>30</SUP></A> 
<a name="2Ki 5:20"></a><span class="versenum">20</span> Gehazi, the prophet Elisha&#8217;s servant, thought,<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,5,531) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,5,531) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,5,531) ><SUP>31</SUP></A> &#8220;Look, my master did not accept what this Syrian Naaman offered him.<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,5,532) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,5,532) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,5,532) ><SUP>32</SUP></A> As certainly as the <sc>Lord lives, I will run after him and accept something from him.&#8221; 
<a name="2Ki 5:21"></a><span class="versenum">21</span> So Gehazi ran after Naaman. When Naaman saw someone running after him, he got down from his chariot to meet him and asked, &#8220;Is everything all right?&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,5,533) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,5,533) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,5,533) ><SUP>33</SUP></A> 
<a name="2Ki 5:22"></a><span class="versenum">22</span> He answered, &#8220;Everything is fine.<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,5,534) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,5,534) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,5,534) ><SUP>34</SUP></A> My master sent me with this message, &#8216;Look, two servants of the prophets just arrived from the Ephraimite hill country.<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,5,535) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,5,535) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,5,535) ><SUP>35</SUP></A> Please give them a talent<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,5,536) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,5,536) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,5,536) ><SUP>36</SUP></A> of silver and two suits of clothes.&#8217;&#8221; 
<a name="2Ki 5:23"></a><span class="versenum">23</span> Naaman said, &#8220;Please accept two talents of silver.<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,5,537) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,5,537) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,5,537) ><SUP>37</SUP></A> He insisted, and tied up two talents of silver in two bags, along with two suits of clothes. He gave them to two of his servants and they carried them for Gehazi.<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,5,538) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,5,538) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,5,538) ><SUP>38</SUP></A> 
<a name="2Ki 5:24"></a><span class="versenum">24</span> When he arrived at the hill, he took them from the servants<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,5,539) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,5,539) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,5,539) ><SUP>39</SUP></A> and put them in the house. Then he sent the men on their way.<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,5,540) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,5,540) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,5,540) ><SUP>40</SUP></A> </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Ki 5:25"></a><span class="versenum">25</span> When he came and stood before his master, Elisha asked him, &#8220;Where have you been, Gehazi?&#8221; He answered, &#8220;Your servant hasn&#8217;t been anywhere.&#8221; 
<a name="2Ki 5:26"></a><span class="versenum">26</span> Elisha<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,5,541) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,5,541) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,5,541) ><SUP>41</SUP></A> replied, &#8220;I was there in spirit when a man turned and got down from his chariot to meet you.<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,5,542) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,5,542) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,5,542) ><SUP>42</SUP></A> This is not the proper time to accept silver or to accept clothes, olive groves, vineyards, sheep, cattle, and male and female servants.<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,5,543) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,5,543) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,5,543) ><SUP>43</SUP></A>
