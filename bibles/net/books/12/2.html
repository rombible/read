<a name="2Ki 2:2"></a><span class="versenum">2</span> Elijah told Elisha, &#8220;Stay here, for the <sc>Lord has sent me to Bethel.&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,2,22) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,2,22) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,2,22) ><SUP>2</SUP></A> But Elisha said, &#8220;As certainly as the <sc>Lord lives and as you live, I will not leave you.&#8221; So they went down to Bethel. 
<a name="2Ki 2:3"></a><span class="versenum">3</span> Some members of the prophetic guild<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,2,23) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,2,23) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,2,23) ><SUP>3</SUP></A> in Bethel came out to Elisha and said, &#8220;Do you know that today the <sc>Lord is going to take your master from you?&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,2,24) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,2,24) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,2,24) ><SUP>4</SUP></A> He answered, &#8220;Yes, I know.

<a name="2Ki 2:5"></a><span class="versenum">5</span> Some members of the prophetic guild in Jericho approached Elisha and said, &#8220;Do you know that today the <sc>Lord is going to take your master from you?&#8221; He answered, &#8220;Yes, I know. Be quiet.&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Ki 2:6"></a><span class="versenum">6</span> Elijah said to him, &#8220;Stay here, for the <sc>Lord has sent me to the Jordan.&#8221; But he replied, &#8220;As certainly as the <sc>Lord lives and as you live, I will not leave you.&#8221; So they traveled on together. 
<a name="2Ki 2:7"></a><span class="versenum">7</span> The fifty members of the prophetic guild went and stood opposite them at a distance, while Elijah and Elisha<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,2,26) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,2,26) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,2,26) ><SUP>6</SUP></A> stood by the Jordan. 
<a name="2Ki 2:8"></a><span class="versenum">8</span> Elijah took his cloak, folded it up, and hit the water with it. The water divided, and the two of them crossed over on dry ground. </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Ki 2:9"></a><span class="versenum">9</span> When they had crossed over, Elijah said to Elisha, &#8220;What can I do for you,<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,2,27) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,2,27) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,2,27) ><SUP>7</SUP></A> before I am taken away from you?&#8221; Elisha answered, &#8220;May I receive a double portion of the prophetic spirit that energizes you.&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,2,28) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,2,28) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,2,28) ><SUP>8</SUP></A>

<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Ki 2:11"></a><span class="versenum">11</span> As they were walking along and talking, suddenly a fiery chariot<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,2,211) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,2,211) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,2,211) ><SUP>11</SUP></A> pulled by fiery horses appeared.<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,2,212) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,2,212) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,2,212) ><SUP>12</SUP></A> They went between Elijah and Elisha,<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,2,213) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,2,213) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,2,213) ><SUP>13</SUP></A> and Elijah went up to heaven in a windstorm. 
<a name="2Ki 2:12"></a><span class="versenum">12</span> While Elisha was watching, he was crying out, &#8220;My father, my father! The chariot and horsemen of Israel!&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,2,214) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,2,214) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,2,214) ><SUP>14</SUP></A> Then he could no longer see him. He grabbed his clothes and tore them in two. 
<a name="2Ki 2:13"></a><span class="versenum">13</span> He picked up Elijah&#8217;s cloak, which had fallen off him, and went back and stood on the shore of the Jordan. 
<a name="2Ki 2:14"></a><span class="versenum">14</span> He took the cloak that had fallen off Elijah,<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,2,215) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,2,215) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,2,215) ><SUP>15</SUP></A> hit the water with it, and said, &#8220;Where is the <sc>Lord, the God of Elijah?&#8221; When he hit the water, it divided and Elisha crossed over.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Ki 2:15"></a><span class="versenum">15</span> When the members of the prophetic guild in Jericho,<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,2,216) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,2,216) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,2,216) ><SUP>16</SUP></A> who were standing at a distance,<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,2,217) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,2,217) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,2,217) ><SUP>17</SUP></A> saw him do this, they said, &#8220;The spirit that energized Elijah<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,2,218) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,2,218) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,2,218) ><SUP>18</SUP></A> rests upon Elisha.&#8221; They went to meet him and bowed down to the ground before him. 
<a name="2Ki 2:16"></a><span class="versenum">16</span> They said to him, &#8220;Look, there are fifty capable men with your servants. Let them go and look for your master, for the wind sent from the <sc>Lord</><a onclick=vOpenNote(12,2,219) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,2,219) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,2,219) ><SUP>19</SUP></A> may have carried him away and dropped him on one of the hills or in one of the valleys.&#8221; But Elisha<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,2,220) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,2,220) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,2,220) ><SUP>20</SUP></A> replied, &#8220;Don&#8217;t send them out.&#8221; 
<a name="2Ki 2:17"></a><span class="versenum">17</span> But they were so insistent, he became embarrassed. So he said, &#8220;Send them out.&#8221; They sent the fifty men out and they looked for three days, but could not find Elijah.<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,2,221) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,2,221) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,2,221) ><SUP>21</SUP></A> 
<a name="2Ki 2:18"></a><span class="versenum">18</span> When they came back, Elisha<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,2,222) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,2,222) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,2,222) ><SUP>22</SUP></A> was staying in Jericho. He said to them, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell you, &#8216;Don&#8217;t go&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Elisha Demonstrates His Authority</p><p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Ki 2:19"></a><span class="versenum">19</span> The men of the city said to Elisha, &#8220;Look, the city has a good location, as our<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,2,223) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,2,223) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,2,223) ><SUP>23</SUP></A> master can see. But the water is bad and the land doesn&#8217;t produce crops.&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,2,224) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,2,224) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,2,224) ><SUP>24</SUP></A>

<a name="2Ki 2:21"></a><span class="versenum">21</span> He went out to the spring and threw the salt in. Then he said, &#8220;This is what the <sc>Lord says, &#8216;I have purified<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,2,226) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,2,226) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,2,226) ><SUP>26</SUP></A> this water.

<a name="2Ki 2:22"></a><span class="versenum">22</span> The water has been pure to this very day, just as Elisha prophesied.<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,2,228) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,2,228) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,2,228) ><SUP>28</SUP></A> </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="2Ki 2:23"></a><span class="versenum">23</span> He went up from there to Bethel.<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,2,229) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,2,229) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,2,229) ><SUP>29</SUP></A> As he was traveling up the road, some young boys<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,2,230) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,2,230) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,2,230) ><SUP>30</SUP></A> came out of the city and made fun of him, saying, &#8220;Go on up, baldy! Go on up, baldy!&#8221; 
<a name="2Ki 2:24"></a><span class="versenum">24</span> When he turned around and saw them, he called God&#8217;s judgment down on them.<a onclick=vOpenNote(12,2,231) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,12,2,231) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,12,2,231) ><SUP>31</SUP></A> Two female bears came out of the woods and ripped forty-two of the boys to pieces.
