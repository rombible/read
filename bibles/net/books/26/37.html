<a name="Eze 37:2"></a><span class="versenum">2</span> He made me walk all around among them.<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,37,373) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,37,373) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,37,373) ><SUP>3</SUP></A> I realized<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,37,374) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,37,374) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,37,374) ><SUP>4</SUP></A> there were a great many bones in the valley and they were very dry. 
<a name="Eze 37:3"></a><span class="versenum">3</span> He said to me, &#8220;Son of man, can these bones live?&#8221; I said to him, &#8220;Sovereign Lord, you know.&#8221; 
<a name="Eze 37:4"></a><span class="versenum">4</span> Then he said to me, &#8220;Prophesy over these bones, and tell them: &#8216;Dry bones, hear the word of the <sc>Lord. 
<a name="Eze 37:5"></a><span class="versenum">5</span> This is what the sovereign <sc>Lord says to these bones: Look, I am about to infuse breath<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,37,375) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,37,375) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,37,375) ><SUP>5</SUP></A> into you and you will live.

<a name="Eze 37:7"></a><span class="versenum">7</span> So I prophesied as I was commanded.

<a name="Eze 37:8"></a><span class="versenum">8</span> As I watched, I saw<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,37,379) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,37,379) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,37,379) ><SUP>9</SUP></A> tendons on them, then muscles appeared,<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,37,3710) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,37,3710) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,37,3710) ><SUP>10</SUP></A> and skin covered over them from above, but there was no breath<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,37,3711) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,37,3711) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,37,3711) ><SUP>11</SUP></A> in them.</p>

<a name="Eze 37:10"></a><span class="versenum">10</span> So I prophesied as I was commanded, and the breath came into them; they lived and stood on their feet, an extremely great army. </p>

<a name="Eze 37:12"></a><span class="versenum">12</span> Therefore prophesy, and tell them, &#8216;This is what the sovereign <sc>Lord says: Look, I am about to open your graves and will raise you from your graves, my people. I will bring you to the land of Israel.
