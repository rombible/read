<a name="Eze 42:2"></a><span class="versenum">2</span> Its length was 175 feet<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,42,421) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,42,421) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,42,421) ><SUP>1</SUP></A> on the north side,<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,42,422) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,42,422) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,42,422) ><SUP>2</SUP></A> and its width 87½ feet.<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,42,423) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,42,423) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,42,423) ><SUP>3</SUP></A> 
<a name="Eze 42:3"></a><span class="versenum">3</span> Opposite the 35 feet<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,42,424) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,42,424) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,42,424) ><SUP>4</SUP></A> that belonged to the inner court, and opposite the pavement which belonged to the outer court, gallery faced gallery in the three stories. 
<a name="Eze 42:4"></a><span class="versenum">4</span> In front of the chambers was a walkway on the inner side, 17½ feet<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,42,425) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,42,425) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,42,425) ><SUP>5</SUP></A> wide at a distance of 1¾ feet,<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,42,426) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,42,426) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,42,426) ><SUP>6</SUP></A> and their entrances were on the north. 
<a name="Eze 42:5"></a><span class="versenum">5</span> Now the upper chambers were narrower, because the galleries took more space from them than from the lower and middle chambers of the building. 
<a name="Eze 42:6"></a><span class="versenum">6</span> For they were in three stories and had no pillars like the pillars of the courts; therefore the upper chambers<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,42,427) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,42,427) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,42,427) ><SUP>7</SUP></A> were set back from the ground more than the lower and upper ones. 
<a name="Eze 42:7"></a><span class="versenum">7</span> As for the outer wall by the side of the chambers, toward the outer court facing the chambers, it was 87½ feet<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,42,428) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,42,428) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,42,428) ><SUP>8</SUP></A> long. 
<a name="Eze 42:8"></a><span class="versenum">8</span> For the chambers on the outer court were 87½ feet<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,42,429) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,42,429) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,42,429) ><SUP>9</SUP></A> long, while those facing the temple were 175 feet<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,42,4210) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,42,4210) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,42,4210) ><SUP>10</SUP></A> long. 
<a name="Eze 42:9"></a><span class="versenum">9</span> Below these chambers was a passage on the east side as one enters from the outer court. </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Eze 42:10"></a><span class="versenum">10</span> At the beginning<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,42,4211) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,42,4211) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,42,4211) ><SUP>11</SUP></A> of the wall of the court toward the south,<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,42,4212) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,42,4212) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,42,4212) ><SUP>12</SUP></A> facing the courtyard and the building, were chambers 
<a name="Eze 42:11"></a><span class="versenum">11</span> with a passage in front of them. They looked like the chambers on the north. Of the same length and width, and all their exits according to their arrangements and entrances 
<a name="Eze 42:12"></a><span class="versenum">12</span> were the chambers<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,42,4213) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,42,4213) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,42,4213) ><SUP>13</SUP></A> which were toward the south. There was an opening at the head of the passage, the passage in front of the corresponding wall toward the east when one enters. </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Eze 42:13"></a><span class="versenum">13</span> Then he said to me, &#8220;The north chambers and the south chambers which face the courtyard are holy chambers where the priests<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,42,4214) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,42,4214) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,42,4214) ><SUP>14</SUP></A> who approach the <sc>Lord will eat the most holy offerings. There they will place the most holy offerings &#8211; the grain offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering, because the place is holy. 
<a name="Eze 42:14"></a><span class="versenum">14</span> When the priests enter, then they will not go out from the sanctuary to the outer court without taking off their garments in which they minister, for these are holy; they will put on other garments, then they will go near the places where the people are.&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Eze 42:15"></a><span class="versenum">15</span> Now when he had finished measuring the interior of the temple, he led me out by the gate which faces east and measured all around. 
<a name="Eze 42:16"></a><span class="versenum">16</span> He measured the east side with the measuring stick<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,42,4215) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,42,4215) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,42,4215) ><SUP>15</SUP></A> as 875 feet<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,42,4216) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,42,4216) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,42,4216) ><SUP>16</SUP></A> by the measuring stick. 
<a name="Eze 42:17"></a><span class="versenum">17</span> He measured the north side as 875 feet by the measuring stick. 
<a name="Eze 42:18"></a><span class="versenum">18</span> He measured the south side as 875 feet by the measuring stick. 
<a name="Eze 42:19"></a><span class="versenum">19</span> He turned to the west side and measured 875 feet by the measuring stick. 
<a name="Eze 42:20"></a><span class="versenum">20</span> He measured it on all four sides. It had a wall around it, 875 feet long and 875 feet wide, to separate the holy and common places. </p>
