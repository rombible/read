<a name="Eze 36:2"></a><span class="versenum">2</span> This is what the sovereign <sc>Lord says: The enemy has spoken against you, saying &#8220;Aha!&#8221; and, &#8220;The ancient heights<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,36,361) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,36,361) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,36,361) ><SUP>1</SUP></A> have become our property!&#8221;&#8217; 
<a name="Eze 36:3"></a><span class="versenum">3</span> So prophesy and say: &#8216;This is what the sovereign <sc>Lord says: Surely because they have made you desolate and crushed you from all directions, so that you have become the property of the rest of the nations, and have become the subject of gossip<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,36,362) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,36,362) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,36,362) ><SUP>2</SUP></A> and slander among the people, 
<a name="Eze 36:4"></a><span class="versenum">4</span> therefore, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the sovereign <sc>Lord: This is what the sovereign <sc>Lord says to the mountains and hills, the ravines and valleys, and to the desolate ruins and the abandoned cities that have become prey and an object of derision to the rest of the nations round about &#8211; 
<a name="Eze 36:5"></a><span class="versenum">5</span> therefore this is what the sovereign <sc>Lord says: Surely I have spoken in the fire of my zeal against the rest of the nations, and against all Edom, who with great joy and utter contempt have made my land their property and prey, because of its pasture.&#8217; </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Eze 36:6"></a><span class="versenum">6</span> &#8220;Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains and hills, the ravines and valleys, &#8216;This is what the sovereign <sc>Lord says: Look, I have spoken in my zeal and in my anger, because you have endured the insults of the nations. 
<a name="Eze 36:7"></a><span class="versenum">7</span> So this is what the sovereign <sc>Lord says: I vow<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,36,363) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,36,363) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,36,363) ><SUP>3</SUP></A> that the nations around you will endure insults as well. </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Eze 36:8"></a><span class="versenum">8</span> &#8220;&#8216;But you, mountains of Israel, will grow your branches, and bear your fruit for my people Israel; for they will arrive soon.<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,36,364) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,36,364) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,36,364) ><SUP>4</SUP></A> 
<a name="Eze 36:9"></a><span class="versenum">9</span> For indeed, I am on your side;<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,36,365) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,36,365) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,36,365) ><SUP>5</SUP></A> I will turn to you, and you will be plowed and planted. 
<a name="Eze 36:10"></a><span class="versenum">10</span> I will multiply your people<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,36,366) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,36,366) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,36,366) ><SUP>6</SUP></A> &#8211; the whole house of Israel, all of it. The cities will be populated and the ruins rebuilt. 
<a name="Eze 36:11"></a><span class="versenum">11</span> I will increase the number of people and animals on you; they will increase and be fruitful.<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,36,367) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,36,367) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,36,367) ><SUP>7</SUP></A> I will cause you to be inhabited as in ancient times, and will do more good for you than at the beginning of your history.<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,36,368) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,36,368) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,36,368) ><SUP>8</SUP></A> Then you will know that I am the <sc>Lord. 
<a name="Eze 36:12"></a><span class="versenum">12</span> I will lead people, my people Israel, across you; they will possess you and you will become their inheritance. No longer will you bereave them of their children. </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Eze 36:13"></a><span class="versenum">13</span> &#8220;&#8216;This is what the sovereign <sc>Lord says: Because they are saying to you, &#8220;You are a devourer of men, and bereave your nation of children,&#8221; 
<a name="Eze 36:14"></a><span class="versenum">14</span> therefore you will no longer devour people and no longer bereave your nation of children, declares the sovereign <sc>Lord. 
<a name="Eze 36:15"></a><span class="versenum">15</span> I will no longer subject you to<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,36,369) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,36,369) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,36,369) ><SUP>9</SUP></A> the nations&#8217; insults; no longer will you bear the shame of the peoples, and no longer will you bereave<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,36,3610) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,36,3610) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,36,3610) ><SUP>10</SUP></A> your nation, declares the sovereign <sc>Lord.&#8217;&#8221; </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Eze 36:16"></a><span class="versenum">16</span> The word of the <sc>Lord came to me: 
<a name="Eze 36:17"></a><span class="versenum">17</span> &#8220;Son of man, when the house of Israel was living on their own land, they defiled it by their behavior<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,36,3611) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,36,3611) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,36,3611) ><SUP>11</SUP></A> and their deeds. In my sight their behavior was like the uncleanness of a woman having her monthly period. 
<a name="Eze 36:18"></a><span class="versenum">18</span> So I poured my anger on them<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,36,3612) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,36,3612) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,36,3612) ><SUP>12</SUP></A> because of the blood they shed on the land and because of the idols with which they defiled it.<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,36,3613) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,36,3613) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,36,3613) ><SUP>13</SUP></A> 
<a name="Eze 36:19"></a><span class="versenum">19</span> I scattered them among the nations; they were dispersed throughout foreign countries. In accordance with their behavior and their deeds I judged them. 
<a name="Eze 36:20"></a><span class="versenum">20</span> But when they arrived in the nations where they went, they profaned my holy name. It was said of them, &#8216;These are the people of the <sc>Lord, yet they have departed from his land.&#8217; 
<a name="Eze 36:21"></a><span class="versenum">21</span> I was concerned for my holy reputation<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,36,3614) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,36,3614) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,36,3614) ><SUP>14</SUP></A> which the house of Israel profaned among the nations where they went. </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Eze 36:22"></a><span class="versenum">22</span> &#8220;Therefore say to the house of Israel, &#8216;This is what the sovereign <sc>Lord says: It is not for your sake that I am about to act, O house of Israel, but for the sake of my holy reputation<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,36,3615) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,36,3615) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,36,3615) ><SUP>15</SUP></A> which you profaned among the nations where you went. 
<a name="Eze 36:23"></a><span class="versenum">23</span> I will magnify<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,36,3616) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,36,3616) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,36,3616) ><SUP>16</SUP></A> my great name that has been profaned among the nations, that you have profaned among them.

<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Eze 36:24"></a><span class="versenum">24</span> &#8220;&#8216;I will take you from the nations and gather you from all the countries; then I will bring you to your land.

<a name="Eze 36:29"></a><span class="versenum">29</span> I will save you from all your uncleanness. I will call for the grain and multiply it; I will not bring a famine on you. 
<a name="Eze 36:30"></a><span class="versenum">30</span> I will multiply the fruit of the trees and the produce of the fields, so that you will never again suffer the disgrace of famine among the nations. 
<a name="Eze 36:31"></a><span class="versenum">31</span> Then you will remember your evil behavior<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,36,3624) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,36,3624) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,36,3624) ><SUP>24</SUP></A> and your deeds which were not good; you will loathe yourselves on account of your sins and your abominable deeds.
