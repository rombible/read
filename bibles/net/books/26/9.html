<p class=bodytext><p class="paragraphtitle">The Execution of Idolaters</p><p class="bodytext"><a name="Eze 9:1"></a><span class="versenum">1</span> Then he shouted in my ears, &#8220;Approach,<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,9,91) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,9,91) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,9,91) ><SUP>1</SUP></A> you who are to visit destruction on the city, each with his destructive weapon in his hand!&#8221; 
<a name="Eze 9:2"></a><span class="versenum">2</span> Next, I noticed<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,9,92) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,9,92) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,9,92) ><SUP>2</SUP></A> six men<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,9,93) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,9,93) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,9,93) ><SUP>3</SUP></A> coming from the direction of the upper gate<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,9,94) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,9,94) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,9,94) ><SUP>4</SUP></A> which faces north, each with his war club in his hand. Among them was a man dressed in linen with a writing kit<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,9,95) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,9,95) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,9,95) ><SUP>5</SUP></A> at his side. They came and stood beside the bronze altar. </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Eze 9:3"></a><span class="versenum">3</span> Then the glory of the God of Israel went up from the cherub where it had rested to the threshold of the temple.<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,9,96) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,9,96) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,9,96) ><SUP>6</SUP></A> He called to the man dressed in linen who had the writing kit at his side. 
<a name="Eze 9:4"></a><span class="versenum">4</span> The <sc>Lord said to him, &#8220;Go through the city of Jerusalem<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,9,97) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,9,97) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,9,97) ><SUP>7</SUP></A> and put a mark<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,9,98) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,9,98) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,9,98) ><SUP>8</SUP></A> on the foreheads of the people who moan and groan over all the abominations practiced in it.&#8221; </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Eze 9:5"></a><span class="versenum">5</span> While I listened, he said to the others,<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,9,99) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,9,99) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,9,99) ><SUP>9</SUP></A> &#8220;Go through the city after him and strike people down; do no let your eye pity nor spare<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,9,910) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,9,910) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,9,910) ><SUP>10</SUP></A> anyone! 
<a name="Eze 9:6"></a><span class="versenum">6</span> Old men, young men, young women, little children, and women &#8211; wipe them out! But do not touch anyone who has the mark. Begin at my sanctuary!&#8221; So they began with the elders who were at the front of the temple. </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Eze 9:7"></a><span class="versenum">7</span> He said to them, &#8220;Defile the temple and fill the courtyards with corpses. Go!&#8221; So they went out and struck people down throughout the city. 
<a name="Eze 9:8"></a><span class="versenum">8</span> While they were striking them down, I was left alone, and I threw myself face down and cried out, &#8220;Ah, sovereign <sc>Lord! Will you destroy the entire remnant of Israel when you pour out your fury on Jerusalem?&#8221; </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Eze 9:9"></a><span class="versenum">9</span> He said to me, &#8220;The sin of the house of Israel and Judah is extremely great; the land is full of murder, and the city is full of corruption,<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,9,911) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,9,911) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,9,911) ><SUP>11</SUP></A> for they say, &#8216;The <sc>Lord has abandoned the land, and the <sc>Lord does not see!&#8217;<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,9,912) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,9,912) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,9,912) ><SUP>12</SUP></A> 
<a name="Eze 9:10"></a><span class="versenum">10</span> But as for me, my eye will not pity them nor will I spare<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,9,913) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,9,913) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,9,913) ><SUP>13</SUP></A> them; I hereby repay them for what they have done.&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,9,914) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,9,914) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,9,914) ><SUP>14</SUP></A> </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Eze 9:11"></a><span class="versenum">11</span> Next I noticed the man dressed in linen with the writing kit at his side bringing back word: &#8220;I have done just as you commanded me.&#8221; </p>
