<a name="Eze 46:20"></a><span class="versenum">20</span> He said to me, &#8220;This is the place where the priests will boil the guilt offering and the sin offering, and where they will bake the grain offering, so that they do not bring them out to the outer court to transmit holiness to the people.&#8221; </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Eze 46:21"></a><span class="versenum">21</span> Then he brought me out to the outer court and led me past the four corners of the court, and I noticed<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,46,4618) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,46,4618) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,46,4618) ><SUP>18</SUP></A> that in every corner of the court there was a court.

<a name="Eze 46:23"></a><span class="versenum">23</span> There was a row of masonry around each of the four courts, and places for boiling offerings were made under the rows all around. 
<a name="Eze 46:24"></a><span class="versenum">24</span> Then he said to me, &#8220;These are the houses for boiling, where the ministers of the temple boil the sacrifices of the people.&#8221; </p>
