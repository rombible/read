<a name="Eze 14:2"></a><span class="versenum">2</span> The word of the <sc>Lord came to me: 
<a name="Eze 14:3"></a><span class="versenum">3</span> &#8220;Son of man, these men have erected their idols in their hearts and placed the obstacle leading to their iniquity<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,14,141) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,14,141) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,14,141) ><SUP>1</SUP></A> right before their faces. Should I really allow them to seek<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,14,142) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,14,142) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,14,142) ><SUP>2</SUP></A> me? 
<a name="Eze 14:4"></a><span class="versenum">4</span> Therefore speak to them and say to them, &#8216;This is what the sovereign <sc>Lord says: When any one from the house of Israel erects his idols in his heart and sets the obstacle leading to his iniquity before his face, and then consults a prophet, I the <sc>Lord am determined to answer him personally according to the enormity of his idolatry.<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,14,143) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,14,143) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,14,143) ><SUP>3</SUP></A> 
<a name="Eze 14:5"></a><span class="versenum">5</span> I will do this in order to capture the hearts of the house of Israel, who have alienated themselves from me on account of all their idols.&#8217; </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Eze 14:6"></a><span class="versenum">6</span> &#8220;Therefore say to the house of Israel, &#8216;This is what the sovereign <sc>Lord says: Return! Turn from your idols, and turn your faces away from your abominations. 
<a name="Eze 14:7"></a><span class="versenum">7</span> For when anyone from the house of Israel, or the foreigner who lives in Israel, separates himself from me and erects his idols in his heart and sets the obstacle leading to his iniquity before his face, and then consults a prophet to seek something from me, I the <sc>Lord am determined to answer him personally. 
<a name="Eze 14:8"></a><span class="versenum">8</span> I will set my face against that person and will make him an object lesson and a byword<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,14,144) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,14,144) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,14,144) ><SUP>4</SUP></A> and will cut him off from among my people. Then you will know that I am the <sc>Lord. </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Eze 14:9"></a><span class="versenum">9</span> &#8220;&#8216;As for the prophet, if he is made a fool by being deceived into speaking a prophetic word &#8211; I, the <sc>Lord, have made a fool of<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,14,145) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,14,145) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,14,145) ><SUP>5</SUP></A> that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand against him and destroy him from among my people Israel. 
<a name="Eze 14:10"></a><span class="versenum">10</span> They will bear their punishment;<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,14,146) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,14,146) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,14,146) ><SUP>6</SUP></A> the punishment of the one who sought an oracle will be the same as the punishment of the prophet who gave it<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,14,147) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,14,147) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,14,147) ><SUP>7</SUP></A> 
<a name="Eze 14:11"></a><span class="versenum">11</span> so that the house of Israel will no longer go astray from me, nor continue to defile themselves by all their sins. They will be my people and I will be their God,<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,14,148) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,14,148) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,14,148) ><SUP>8</SUP></A> declares the sovereign <sc>Lord.&#8217;&#8221; </p>

<a name="Eze 14:13"></a><span class="versenum">13</span> &#8220;Son of man, suppose a country sins against me by being unfaithful, and I stretch out my hand against it, cut off its bread supply,<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,14,149) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,14,149) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,14,149) ><SUP>9</SUP></A> cause famine to come on it, and kill both people and animals. 
<a name="Eze 14:14"></a><span class="versenum">14</span> Even if these three men, Noah, Daniel,<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,14,1410) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,14,1410) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,14,1410) ><SUP>10</SUP></A> and Job, were in it, they would save only their own lives by their righteousness, declares the sovereign <sc>Lord. </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Eze 14:15"></a><span class="versenum">15</span> &#8220;Suppose I were to send wild animals through the land and kill its children, leaving it desolate, without travelers due to the wild animals. 
<a name="Eze 14:16"></a><span class="versenum">16</span> Even if these three men were in it, as surely as I live, declares the sovereign <sc>Lord, they could not save their own sons or daughters; they would save only their own lives, and the land would become desolate. </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Eze 14:17"></a><span class="versenum">17</span> &#8220;Or suppose I were to bring a sword against that land and say, &#8216;Let a sword pass through the land,&#8217; and I were to kill both people and animals. 
<a name="Eze 14:18"></a><span class="versenum">18</span> Even if these three men were in it, as surely as I live, declares the sovereign <sc>Lord, they could not save their own sons or daughters &#8211; they would save only their own lives. </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Eze 14:19"></a><span class="versenum">19</span> &#8220;Or suppose I were to send a plague into that land, and pour out my rage on it with bloodshed, killing both people and animals.

<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Eze 14:21"></a><span class="versenum">21</span> &#8220;For this is what the sovereign <sc>Lord says: How much worse will it be when I send my four terrible judgments &#8211; sword, famine, wild animals, and plague &#8211; to Jerusalem<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,14,1411) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,14,1411) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,14,1411) ><SUP>11</SUP></A> to kill both people and animals! 
<a name="Eze 14:22"></a><span class="versenum">22</span> Yet some survivors will be left in it, sons and daughters who will be brought out. They will come out to you, and when you see their behavior and their deeds, you will be consoled about the catastrophe I have brought on Jerusalem &#8211; for everything I brought on it. 
<a name="Eze 14:23"></a><span class="versenum">23</span> They will console you when you see their behavior and their deeds, because you will know that it was not without reason that I have done everything which I have done in it, declares the sovereign <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
