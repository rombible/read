<p class=bodytext><p class="paragraphtitle">Water from the Temple</p><p class="bodytext"><a name="Eze 47:1"></a><span class="versenum">1</span> Then he brought me back to the entrance of the temple. I noticed<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,47,471) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,47,471) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,47,471) ><SUP>1</SUP></A> that water was flowing from under the threshold of the temple toward the east (for the temple faced east). The water was flowing down from under the right side of the temple, from south of the altar. 
<a name="Eze 47:2"></a><span class="versenum">2</span> He led me out by way of the north gate and brought me around the outside of the outer gate that faces toward the east; I noticed<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,47,472) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,47,472) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,47,472) ><SUP>2</SUP></A> that the water was trickling out from the south side. </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Eze 47:3"></a><span class="versenum">3</span> When the man went out toward the east with a measuring line in his hand, he measured 1,750 feet,<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,47,473) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,47,473) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,47,473) ><SUP>3</SUP></A> and then he led me through water, which was ankle deep. 
<a name="Eze 47:4"></a><span class="versenum">4</span> Again he measured 1,750 feet and led me through the water, which was now knee deep. Once more he measured 1,750 feet and led me through the water, which was waist deep. 
<a name="Eze 47:5"></a><span class="versenum">5</span> Again he measured 1,750 feet and it was a river I could not cross, for the water had risen; it was deep enough to swim in, a river that could not be crossed. 
<a name="Eze 47:6"></a><span class="versenum">6</span> He said to me, &#8220;Son of man, have you seen this?&#8221; </p>
<p class="bodytext">Then he led me back to the bank of the river. 
<a name="Eze 47:7"></a><span class="versenum">7</span> When I had returned, I noticed<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,47,474) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,47,474) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,47,474) ><SUP>4</SUP></A> a vast number of trees on the banks of the river, on both sides. 
<a name="Eze 47:8"></a><span class="versenum">8</span> He said to me, &#8220;These waters go out toward the eastern region and flow down into the Arabah; when they enter the Dead Sea,<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,47,475) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,47,475) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,47,475) ><SUP>5</SUP></A> where the sea is stagnant,<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,47,476) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,47,476) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,47,476) ><SUP>6</SUP></A> the waters become fresh.<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,47,477) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,47,477) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,47,477) ><SUP>7</SUP></A> 
<a name="Eze 47:9"></a><span class="versenum">9</span> Every living creature which swarms where the river<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,47,478) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,47,478) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,47,478) ><SUP>8</SUP></A> flows will live; there will be many fish, for these waters flow there.

<a name="Eze 47:10"></a><span class="versenum">10</span> Fishermen will stand beside it; from Engedi to En-eglaim they will spread nets. They will catch many kinds of fish, like the fish of the Great Sea.<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,47,4710) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,47,4710) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,47,4710) ><SUP>10</SUP></A>

<a name="Eze 47:12"></a><span class="versenum">12</span> On both sides of the river&#8217;s banks, every kind of tree will grow for food. Their leaves will not wither nor will their fruit fail, but they will bear fruit every month, because their water source flows from the sanctuary. Their fruit will be for food and their leaves for healing.&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,47,4711) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,47,4711) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,47,4711) ><SUP>11</SUP></A> </p>
