<a name="Eze 34:2"></a><span class="versenum">2</span> &#8220;Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,34,341) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,34,341) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,34,341) ><SUP>1</SUP></A> of Israel; prophesy, and say to them &#8211; to the shepherds: &#8216;This is what the sovereign <sc>Lord says: Woe to the shepherds of Israel who have been feeding themselves! Should not shepherds feed the flock? 
<a name="Eze 34:3"></a><span class="versenum">3</span> You eat the fat, you clothe yourselves with the wool, you slaughter the choice animals, but you do not feed the sheep! 
<a name="Eze 34:4"></a><span class="versenum">4</span> You have not strengthened the weak, healed the sick, bandaged the injured, brought back the strays, or sought the lost, but with force and harshness<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,34,342) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,34,342) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,34,342) ><SUP>2</SUP></A> you have ruled over them. 
<a name="Eze 34:5"></a><span class="versenum">5</span> They were scattered because they had no shepherd, and they became food for every wild beast.<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,34,343) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,34,343) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,34,343) ><SUP>3</SUP></A> 
<a name="Eze 34:6"></a><span class="versenum">6</span> My sheep wandered over all the mountains and on every high hill. My sheep were scattered over the entire face of the earth with no one looking or searching for them. </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Eze 34:7"></a><span class="versenum">7</span> &#8220;&#8216;Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the <sc>Lord: 
<a name="Eze 34:8"></a><span class="versenum">8</span> As surely as I live, declares the sovereign <sc>Lord, my sheep have become prey and have become food for all the wild beasts. There was no shepherd, and my shepherds did not search for my flock, but fed themselves and did not feed my sheep, 
<a name="Eze 34:9"></a><span class="versenum">9</span> Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the <sc>Lord: 
<a name="Eze 34:10"></a><span class="versenum">10</span> This is what the sovereign <sc>Lord says: Look, I am against the shepherds, and I will demand my sheep from their hand. I will no longer let them be shepherds;<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,34,344) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,34,344) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,34,344) ><SUP>4</SUP></A> the shepherds will not feed themselves anymore. I will rescue my sheep from their mouth, so that they will no longer be food for them.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Eze 34:11"></a><span class="versenum">11</span> &#8220;&#8216;For this is what the sovereign <sc>Lord says: Look, I myself will search for my sheep and seek them out. 
<a name="Eze 34:12"></a><span class="versenum">12</span> As a shepherd seeks out his flock when he is among his scattered sheep, so I will seek out my flock. I will rescue them from all the places where they have been scattered on a cloudy, dark day.<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,34,345) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,34,345) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,34,345) ><SUP>5</SUP></A> 
<a name="Eze 34:13"></a><span class="versenum">13</span> I will bring them out from among the peoples and gather them from foreign countries; I will bring them to their own land. I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, by the streams and all the inhabited places of the land. 
<a name="Eze 34:14"></a><span class="versenum">14</span> In a good pasture I will feed them; the mountain heights of Israel will be their pasture. There they will lie down in a lush<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,34,346) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,34,346) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,34,346) ><SUP>6</SUP></A> pasture, and they will feed on rich grass on the mountains of Israel. 
<a name="Eze 34:15"></a><span class="versenum">15</span> I myself will feed my sheep and I myself will make them lie down, declares the sovereign <sc>Lord. 
<a name="Eze 34:16"></a><span class="versenum">16</span> I will seek the lost and bring back the strays; I will bandage the injured and strengthen the sick, but the fat and the strong I will destroy. I will feed them &#8211; with judgment! </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Eze 34:17"></a><span class="versenum">17</span> &#8220;&#8216;As for you, my sheep, this is what the sovereign <sc>Lord says: Look, I am about to judge between one sheep and another, between rams and goats. 
<a name="Eze 34:18"></a><span class="versenum">18</span> Is it not enough for you to feed on the good pasture, that you must trample the rest of your pastures with your feet? When you drink clean water, must you muddy the rest of the water by trampling it with your feet? 
<a name="Eze 34:19"></a><span class="versenum">19</span> As for my sheep, they must eat what you trampled with your feet, and drink what you have muddied with your feet! </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Eze 34:20"></a><span class="versenum">20</span> &#8220;&#8216;Therefore, this is what the sovereign <sc>Lord says to them: Look, I myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep. 
<a name="Eze 34:21"></a><span class="versenum">21</span> Because you push with your side and your shoulder, and thrust your horns at all the weak sheep until you scatter them abroad,<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,34,347) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,34,347) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,34,347) ><SUP>7</SUP></A> 
<a name="Eze 34:22"></a><span class="versenum">22</span> I will save my sheep; they will no longer be prey. I will judge between one sheep and another. </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Eze 34:23"></a><span class="versenum">23</span> I will set one shepherd over them, and he will feed them &#8211; namely, my servant David.<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,34,348) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,34,348) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,34,348) ><SUP>8</SUP></A> He will feed them and will be their shepherd.

<a name="Eze 34:28"></a><span class="versenum">28</span> They will no longer be prey for the nations and the wild beasts will not devour them. They will live securely and no one will make them afraid.
