<a name="Eze 31:12"></a><span class="versenum">12</span> Foreigners from the most terrifying nations have cut it down and left it to lie there on the mountains. In all the valleys its branches have fallen, and its boughs lie broken in the ravines of the land.

<a name="Eze 31:14"></a><span class="versenum">14</span> For this reason no watered trees will grow so tall; their tops will not reach into the clouds, nor will the well-watered ones grow that high.<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,31,3113) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,31,3113) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,31,3113) ><SUP>13</SUP></A> For all of them have been appointed to die in the lower parts of the earth;<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,31,3114) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,31,3114) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,31,3114) ><SUP>14</SUP></A> they will be among mere mortals,<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,31,3115) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,31,3115) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,31,3115) ><SUP>15</SUP></A> with those who descend to the pit. </p>

I clothed Lebanon in black for it, and all the trees of the field wilted because of it. 
<a name="Eze 31:16"></a><span class="versenum">16</span> I made the nations shake at the sound of its fall, when I threw it down to Sheol, along with those who descend to the pit.<a onclick=vOpenNote(26,31,3118) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,26,31,3118) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,26,31,3118) ><SUP>18</SUP></A> Then all the trees of Eden, the choicest and the best of Lebanon, all that were well-watered, were comforted in the earth below.

You will be brought down with the trees of Eden to the lower parts of the earth; you will lie among the uncircumcised, with those killed by the sword!
