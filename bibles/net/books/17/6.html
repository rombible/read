<p class=bodytext><p class="paragraphtitle">The Turning Point: The King Honors Mordecai</p><p class="bodytext"><a name="Es 6:1"></a><span class="versenum">1</span> Throughout that night the king was unable to sleep,<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,6,61) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,6,61) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,6,61) ><SUP>1</SUP></A> so he asked for the book containing the historical records<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,6,62) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,6,62) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,6,62) ><SUP>2</SUP></A> to be brought. As the records<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,6,63) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,6,63) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,6,63) ><SUP>3</SUP></A> were being read in the king&#8217;s presence, 
<a name="Es 6:2"></a><span class="versenum">2</span> it was found written that Mordecai had disclosed that Bigthana<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,6,64) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,6,64) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,6,64) ><SUP>4</SUP></A> and Teresh, two of the king&#8217;s eunuchs who guarded the entrance, had plotted to assassinate<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,6,65) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,6,65) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,6,65) ><SUP>5</SUP></A> King Ahasuerus.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Es 6:3"></a><span class="versenum">3</span> The king asked, &#8220;What great honor<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,6,66) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,6,66) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,6,66) ><SUP>6</SUP></A> was bestowed on Mordecai because of this?&#8221; The king&#8217;s attendants who served him responded, &#8220;Not a thing was done for him.&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Es 6:4"></a><span class="versenum">4</span> Then the king said, &#8220;Who is that in the courtyard?&#8221; Now Haman had come to the outer courtyard of the palace to suggest that the king hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had constructed for him. 
<a name="Es 6:5"></a><span class="versenum">5</span> The king&#8217;s attendants said to him, &#8220;It is Haman who is standing in the courtyard.&#8221; The king said, &#8220;Let him enter.&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Es 6:6"></a><span class="versenum">6</span> So Haman came in, and the king said to him, &#8220;What should be done for the man whom the king wishes to honor?&#8221; Haman thought to himself,<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,6,67) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,6,67) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,6,67) ><SUP>7</SUP></A> &#8220;Who is it that the king would want to honor more than me?&#8221; 
<a name="Es 6:7"></a><span class="versenum">7</span> So Haman said to the king, &#8220;For the man whom the king wishes to honor, 
<a name="Es 6:8"></a><span class="versenum">8</span> let them bring royal attire which the king himself has worn and a horse on which the king himself has ridden &#8211; one bearing the royal insignia!<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,6,68) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,6,68) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,6,68) ><SUP>8</SUP></A> 
<a name="Es 6:9"></a><span class="versenum">9</span> Then let this clothing and this horse be given to one of the king&#8217;s noble officials. Let him<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,6,69) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,6,69) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,6,69) ><SUP>9</SUP></A> then clothe the man whom the king wishes to honor, and let him lead him about through the plaza of the city on the horse, calling<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,6,610) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,6,610) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,6,610) ><SUP>10</SUP></A> before him, &#8216;So shall it be done to the man whom the king wishes to honor!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Es 6:10"></a><span class="versenum">10</span> The king then said to Haman, &#8220;Go quickly! Take the clothing and the horse, just as you have described, and do as you just indicated to Mordecai the Jew who sits at the king&#8217;s gate. Don&#8217;t neglect<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,6,611) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,6,611) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,6,611) ><SUP>11</SUP></A> a single thing of all that you have said.&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Es 6:11"></a><span class="versenum">11</span> So Haman took the clothing and the horse, and he clothed Mordecai. He led him about on the horse throughout the plaza of the city, calling before him, &#8220;So shall it be done to the man whom the king wishes to honor!&#8221; </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Es 6:12"></a><span class="versenum">12</span> Then Mordecai again sat at the king&#8217;s gate, while Haman hurried away to his home, mournful and with a veil over his head. 
<a name="Es 6:13"></a><span class="versenum">13</span> Haman then related to his wife Zeresh and to all his friends everything that had happened to him. These wise men,<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,6,612) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,6,612) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,6,612) ><SUP>12</SUP></A> along with his wife Zeresh, said to him, &#8220;If indeed this Mordecai before whom you have begun to fall is Jewish,<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,6,613) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,6,613) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,6,613) ><SUP>13</SUP></A> you will not prevail against him. No, you will surely fall before him!&#8221; </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Es 6:14"></a><span class="versenum">14</span> While they were still speaking with him, the king&#8217;s eunuchs arrived. They quickly brought Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared.</p>
