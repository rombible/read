<a name="Es 2:2"></a><span class="versenum">2</span> The king&#8217;s servants who attended him said, &#8220;Let a search be conducted in the king&#8217;s behalf for attractive young women.<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,2,24) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,2,24) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,2,24) ><SUP>4</SUP></A> 
<a name="Es 2:3"></a><span class="versenum">3</span> And let the king appoint officers throughout all the provinces of his kingdom to gather all the attractive young women to Susa the citadel, to the harem<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,2,25) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,2,25) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,2,25) ><SUP>5</SUP></A> under the authority of Hegai, the king&#8217;s eunuch who oversees the women, and let him provide whatever cosmetics they desire.<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,2,26) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,2,26) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,2,26) ><SUP>6</SUP></A> 
<a name="Es 2:4"></a><span class="versenum">4</span> Let the young woman whom the king finds most attractive<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,2,27) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,2,27) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,2,27) ><SUP>7</SUP></A> become queen in place of Vashti.&#8221; This seemed like a good idea to the king,<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,2,28) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,2,28) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,2,28) ><SUP>8</SUP></A> so he acted accordingly.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Es 2:5"></a><span class="versenum">5</span> Now there happened to be a Jewish man in Susa the citadel whose name was Mordecai.<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,2,29) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,2,29) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,2,29) ><SUP>9</SUP></A> He was the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjaminite, 
<a name="Es 2:6"></a><span class="versenum">6</span> who had been taken into exile from Jerusalem<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,2,210) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,2,210) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,2,210) ><SUP>10</SUP></A> with the captives who had been carried into exile with Jeconiah<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,2,211) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,2,211) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,2,211) ><SUP>11</SUP></A> king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had taken into exile. 
<a name="Es 2:7"></a><span class="versenum">7</span> Now he was acting as the guardian<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,2,212) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,2,212) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,2,212) ><SUP>12</SUP></A> of Hadassah<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,2,213) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,2,213) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,2,213) ><SUP>13</SUP></A> (that is, Esther), the daughter of his uncle, for neither her father nor her mother was alive.<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,2,214) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,2,214) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,2,214) ><SUP>14</SUP></A> This young woman was very attractive and had a beautiful figure.<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,2,215) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,2,215) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,2,215) ><SUP>15</SUP></A> When her father and mother died, Mordecai had raised her<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,2,216) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,2,216) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,2,216) ><SUP>16</SUP></A> as if she were his own daughter.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Es 2:8"></a><span class="versenum">8</span> It so happened that when the king&#8217;s edict and his law became known<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,2,217) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,2,217) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,2,217) ><SUP>17</SUP></A> many young women were taken to Susa the citadel to be placed under the authority of Hegai. Esther also was taken to the royal palace<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,2,218) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,2,218) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,2,218) ><SUP>18</SUP></A> to be under the authority of Hegai, who was overseeing the women. 
<a name="Es 2:9"></a><span class="versenum">9</span> This young woman pleased him,<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,2,219) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,2,219) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,2,219) ><SUP>19</SUP></A> and she found favor with him. He quickly provided her with her cosmetics and her rations; he also provided her with the seven specially chosen<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,2,220) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,2,220) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,2,220) ><SUP>20</SUP></A> young women who were from the palace. He then transferred her and her young women to the best quarters in the harem.<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,2,221) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,2,221) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,2,221) ><SUP>21</SUP></A></p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Es 2:10"></a><span class="versenum">10</span> Now Esther had not disclosed her people or her lineage,<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,2,222) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,2,222) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,2,222) ><SUP>22</SUP></A> for Mordecai had instructed her not to do so.<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,2,223) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,2,223) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,2,223) ><SUP>23</SUP></A> 
<a name="Es 2:11"></a><span class="versenum">11</span> And day after day Mordecai used to walk back and forth in front of the court of the harem in order to learn how Esther was doing<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,2,224) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,2,224) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,2,224) ><SUP>24</SUP></A> and what might happen to her.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Es 2:12"></a><span class="versenum">12</span> At the end of the twelve months that were required for the women,<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,2,225) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,2,225) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,2,225) ><SUP>25</SUP></A> when the turn of each young woman arrived to go to King Ahasuerus &#8211; for in this way they had to fulfill their time of cosmetic treatment: six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with perfume and various ointments used by women &#8211; 
<a name="Es 2:13"></a><span class="versenum">13</span> the woman would go to the king in the following way: Whatever she asked for would be provided for her to take with her from the harem to the royal palace. 
<a name="Es 2:14"></a><span class="versenum">14</span> In the evening she went, and in the morning she returned to a separate part<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,2,226) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,2,226) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,2,226) ><SUP>26</SUP></A> of the harem, to the authority of Shaashgaz the king&#8217;s eunuch who was overseeing the concubines. She would not go back to the king unless the king was pleased with her<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,2,227) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,2,227) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,2,227) ><SUP>27</SUP></A> and she was requested by name.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Es 2:15"></a><span class="versenum">15</span> When it became the turn of Esther daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai (who had raised her as if she were his own daughter<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,2,228) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,2,228) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,2,228) ><SUP>28</SUP></A>) to go to the king, she did not request anything except what Hegai the king&#8217;s eunuch, who was overseer of the women, had recommended. Yet Esther met with the approval of all who saw her. 
<a name="Es 2:16"></a><span class="versenum">16</span> Then Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus at his royal residence in the tenth<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,2,229) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,2,229) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,2,229) ><SUP>29</SUP></A> month (that is, the month of Tebeth) in the seventh<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,2,230) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,2,230) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,2,230) ><SUP>30</SUP></A> year of his reign. 
<a name="Es 2:17"></a><span class="versenum">17</span> And the king loved Esther more than all the other women, and she met with his loving approval<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,2,231) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,2,231) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,2,231) ><SUP>31</SUP></A> more than all the other young women.<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,2,232) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,2,232) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,2,232) ><SUP>32</SUP></A> So he placed the royal high turban on her head and appointed her queen<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,2,233) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,2,233) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,2,233) ><SUP>33</SUP></A> in place of Vashti. 
<a name="Es 2:18"></a><span class="versenum">18</span> Then the king prepared a large banquet for all his officials and his servants &#8211; it was actually Esther&#8217;s banquet. He also set aside a holiday for the provinces, and he provided for offerings at the king&#8217;s expense.<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,2,234) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,2,234) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,2,234) ><SUP>34</SUP></A></p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Mordecai Learns of a Plot against the King</p><p class="bodytext">
<a name="Es 2:19"></a><span class="versenum">19</span> Now when the young women were being gathered again,<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,2,235) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,2,235) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,2,235) ><SUP>35</SUP></A> Mordecai was sitting at the king&#8217;s gate.<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,2,236) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,2,236) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,2,236) ><SUP>36</SUP></A> 
<a name="Es 2:20"></a><span class="versenum">20</span> Esther was still not divulging her lineage or her people,<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,2,237) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,2,237) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,2,237) ><SUP>37</SUP></A> just as Mordecai had instructed her.<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,2,238) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,2,238) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,2,238) ><SUP>38</SUP></A> Esther continued to do whatever Mordecai said, just as she had done when he was raising her.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Es 2:21"></a><span class="versenum">21</span> In those days while Mordecai was sitting at the king&#8217;s gate, Bigthan<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,2,239) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,2,239) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,2,239) ><SUP>39</SUP></A> and Teresh,<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,2,240) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,2,240) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,2,240) ><SUP>40</SUP></A> two of the king&#8217;s eunuchs who protected the entrance,<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,2,241) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,2,241) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,2,241) ><SUP>41</SUP></A> became angry and plotted to assassinate<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,2,242) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,2,242) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,2,242) ><SUP>42</SUP></A> King Ahasuerus. 
<a name="Es 2:22"></a><span class="versenum">22</span> When Mordecai learned of the conspiracy,<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,2,243) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,2,243) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,2,243) ><SUP>43</SUP></A> he informed Queen Esther,<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,2,244) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,2,244) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,2,244) ><SUP>44</SUP></A> and Esther told the king in Mordecai&#8217;s behalf.<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,2,245) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,2,245) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,2,245) ><SUP>45</SUP></A> 
<a name="Es 2:23"></a><span class="versenum">23</span> The king then had the matter investigated and, finding it to be so, had the two conspirators<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,2,246) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,2,246) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,2,246) ><SUP>46</SUP></A> hanged on a gallows.<a onclick=vOpenNote(17,2,247) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,17,2,247) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,17,2,247) ><SUP>47</SUP></A> It was then recorded in the daily chronicles in the king&#8217;s presence.</p>
