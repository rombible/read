<p class=bodytext><p class="paragraphtitle">Nehemiah Is Permitted to Go to Jerusalem</p><p class="bodytext"><a name="Ne 2:1"></a><span class="versenum">1</span> Then in the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when wine was brought to me,<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,2,21) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,2,21) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,2,21) ><SUP>1</SUP></A> I took the wine and gave it to the king. Previously<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,2,22) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,2,22) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,2,22) ><SUP>2</SUP></A> I had not been depressed<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,2,23) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,2,23) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,2,23) ><SUP>3</SUP></A> in the king&#8217;s presence.<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,2,24) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,2,24) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,2,24) ><SUP>4</SUP></A> 
<a name="Ne 2:2"></a><span class="versenum">2</span> So the king said to me, &#8220;Why do you appear to be depressed when you aren&#8217;t sick? What can this be other than sadness of heart?&#8221; This made me very fearful. </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Ne 2:3"></a><span class="versenum">3</span> I replied to the king, &#8220;O king, live forever! Why would I not appear dejected when the city with the graves of my ancestors<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,2,25) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,2,25) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,2,25) ><SUP>5</SUP></A> lies desolate and its gates destroyed<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,2,26) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,2,26) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,2,26) ><SUP>6</SUP></A> by fire?&#8221; 
<a name="Ne 2:4"></a><span class="versenum">4</span> The king responded,<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,2,27) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,2,27) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,2,27) ><SUP>7</SUP></A> &#8220;What is it you are seeking?&#8221; Then I quickly prayed to the God of heaven 
<a name="Ne 2:5"></a><span class="versenum">5</span> and said to the king, &#8220;If the king is so inclined<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,2,28) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,2,28) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,2,28) ><SUP>8</SUP></A> and if your servant has found favor in your sight, dispatch me to Judah, to the city with the graves of my ancestors, so that I can rebuild it.&#8221; 
<a name="Ne 2:6"></a><span class="versenum">6</span> Then the king, with his consort<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,2,29) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,2,29) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,2,29) ><SUP>9</SUP></A> sitting beside him, replied, &#8220;How long would your trip take, and when would you return?&#8221; Since the king was amenable to dispatching me,<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,2,210) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,2,210) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,2,210) ><SUP>10</SUP></A> I gave him a time. 
<a name="Ne 2:7"></a><span class="versenum">7</span> I said to the king, &#8220;If the king is so inclined, let him give me letters for the governors of Trans-Euphrates<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,2,211) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,2,211) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,2,211) ><SUP>11</SUP></A> that will enable me to travel safely until I reach Judah, 
<a name="Ne 2:8"></a><span class="versenum">8</span> and a letter for Asaph the keeper of the king&#8217;s nature preserve,<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,2,212) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,2,212) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,2,212) ><SUP>12</SUP></A> so that he will give me timber for beams for the gates of the fortress adjacent to the temple and for the city wall<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,2,213) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,2,213) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,2,213) ><SUP>13</SUP></A> and for the house to which I go.&#8221; So the king granted me these requests,<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,2,214) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,2,214) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,2,214) ><SUP>14</SUP></A> for the good hand of my God was on me. 
<a name="Ne 2:9"></a><span class="versenum">9</span> Then I went to the governors of Trans-Euphrates, and I presented to them the letters from the king. The king had sent with me officers of the army and horsemen. 
<a name="Ne 2:10"></a><span class="versenum">10</span> When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,2,215) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,2,215) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,2,215) ><SUP>15</SUP></A> heard all this, they were very displeased that someone had come to seek benefit for the Israelites.</p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Nehemiah Arrives in Jerusalem</p><p class="bodytext">
<a name="Ne 2:11"></a><span class="versenum">11</span> So I came to Jerusalem.<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,2,216) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,2,216) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,2,216) ><SUP>16</SUP></A> When I had been there for three days, 
<a name="Ne 2:12"></a><span class="versenum">12</span> I got up during the night, along with a few men who were with me. But I did not tell anyone what my God was putting on my heart to do for Jerusalem. There were no animals with me, except for the one<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,2,217) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,2,217) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,2,217) ><SUP>17</SUP></A> I was riding. 
<a name="Ne 2:13"></a><span class="versenum">13</span> I proceeded through the Valley Gate by night, in the direction of the Well of the Dragons<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,2,218) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,2,218) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,2,218) ><SUP>18</SUP></A> and the Dung Gate,<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,2,219) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,2,219) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,2,219) ><SUP>19</SUP></A> inspecting<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,2,220) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,2,220) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,2,220) ><SUP>20</SUP></A> the walls of Jerusalem that had been breached and its gates that had been destroyed by fire. 
<a name="Ne 2:14"></a><span class="versenum">14</span> I passed on to the Gate of the Well and the King&#8217;s Pool, where there was not enough room for my animal to pass with me. 
<a name="Ne 2:15"></a><span class="versenum">15</span> I continued up the valley during the night, inspecting the wall. Then I turned back and came to the Valley Gate, and so returned. 
<a name="Ne 2:16"></a><span class="versenum">16</span> The officials did not know where I had gone or what I had been doing, for up to this point I had not told any of the Jews or the priests or the nobles or the officials or the rest of the workers. 
<a name="Ne 2:17"></a><span class="versenum">17</span> Then I said to them, &#8220;You see the problem that we have: Jerusalem is desolate and its gates are burned. Come on! Let&#8217;s rebuild the wall of Jerusalem so that this reproach will not continue.&#8221; 
<a name="Ne 2:18"></a><span class="versenum">18</span> Then I related to them how the good hand of my God was on me and what<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,2,221) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,2,221) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,2,221) ><SUP>21</SUP></A> the king had said to me. Then they replied, &#8220;Let&#8217;s begin rebuilding right away!&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,2,222) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,2,222) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,2,222) ><SUP>22</SUP></A> So they readied themselves<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,2,223) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,2,223) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,2,223) ><SUP>23</SUP></A> for this good project. 
<a name="Ne 2:19"></a><span class="versenum">19</span> But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official, and Geshem the Arab heard all this,<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,2,224) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,2,224) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,2,224) ><SUP>24</SUP></A> they derided us and expressed contempt toward us. They said, &#8220;What is this you are doing? Are you rebelling against the king?&#8221; 
<a name="Ne 2:20"></a><span class="versenum">20</span> I responded to them by saying, &#8220;The God of heaven will prosper us. We his servants will start the rebuilding.<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,2,225) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,2,225) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,2,225) ><SUP>25</SUP></A> But you have no just or ancient right in Jerusalem.&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,2,226) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,2,226) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,2,226) ><SUP>26</SUP></A></p>
