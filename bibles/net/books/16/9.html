<a name="Ne 9:10"></a><span class="versenum">10</span> You performed awesome signs<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,9,915) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,9,915) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,9,915) ><SUP>15</SUP></A> against Pharaoh, against his servants, and against all the people of his land, for you knew that the Egyptians<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,9,916) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,9,916) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,9,916) ><SUP>16</SUP></A> had acted presumptuously<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,9,917) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,9,917) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,9,917) ><SUP>17</SUP></A> against them. You made for yourself a name that is celebrated to this day. 
<a name="Ne 9:11"></a><span class="versenum">11</span> You split the sea before them, and they crossed through<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,9,918) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,9,918) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,9,918) ><SUP>18</SUP></A> the sea on dry ground!

<a name="Ne 9:12"></a><span class="versenum">12</span> You guided them with a pillar of cloud by day and with a pillar of fire by night to illumine for them the path they were to travel.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Ne 9:13"></a><span class="versenum">13</span> &#8220;You came down on Mount Sinai and spoke with them from heaven. You provided them with just judgments, true laws, and good statutes and commandments. 
<a name="Ne 9:14"></a><span class="versenum">14</span> You made known to them your holy Sabbath; you issued commandments, statutes, and law to them through<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,9,921) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,9,921) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,9,921) ><SUP>21</SUP></A> Moses your servant. 
<a name="Ne 9:15"></a><span class="versenum">15</span> You provided bread from heaven for them in their time of hunger, and you brought forth water from the rock for them in their time of thirst. You told them to enter in order to possess the land that you had sworn<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,9,922) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,9,922) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,9,922) ><SUP>22</SUP></A> to give them.</p>

<a name="Ne 9:17"></a><span class="versenum">17</span> They refused to obey and did not recall your miracles that you had performed among them. Instead, they rebelled and appointed a leader to return to their bondage in Egypt.<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,9,925) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,9,925) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,9,925) ><SUP>25</SUP></A> But you are a God of forgiveness, merciful and compassionate, slow to get angry and unfailing in your loyal love.<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,9,926) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,9,926) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,9,926) ><SUP>26</SUP></A> You did not abandon them, 
<a name="Ne 9:18"></a><span class="versenum">18</span> even when they made a cast image of a calf for themselves and said, &#8216;This is your God who brought you up from Egypt,&#8217; or when they committed atrocious<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,9,927) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,9,927) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,9,927) ><SUP>27</SUP></A> blasphemies.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Ne 9:19"></a><span class="versenum">19</span> &#8220;Due to your great compassion you did not abandon them in the desert. The pillar of cloud did not stop guiding them in the path by day,<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,9,928) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,9,928) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,9,928) ><SUP>28</SUP></A> nor did the pillar of fire stop illuminating for them by night the path on which they should travel. 
<a name="Ne 9:20"></a><span class="versenum">20</span> You imparted your good Spirit to instruct them. You did not withhold your manna from their mouths; you provided water for their thirst. 
<a name="Ne 9:21"></a><span class="versenum">21</span> For forty years you sustained them. Even in the desert they never lacked anything. Their clothes did not wear out and their feet did not swell.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Ne 9:22"></a><span class="versenum">22</span> &#8220;You gave them kingdoms and peoples, and you allocated them to every corner of the land.<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,9,929) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,9,929) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,9,929) ><SUP>29</SUP></A> They inherited the land of King Sihon of Heshbon<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,9,930) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,9,930) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,9,930) ><SUP>30</SUP></A> and the land of King Og of Bashan. 
<a name="Ne 9:23"></a><span class="versenum">23</span> You multiplied their descendants like the stars of the sky. You brought them to the land you had told their ancestors to enter in order to possess. 
<a name="Ne 9:24"></a><span class="versenum">24</span> Their descendants<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,9,931) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,9,931) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,9,931) ><SUP>31</SUP></A> entered and possessed the land. You subdued before them the Canaanites who were the inhabitants of the land. You delivered them into their hand, together with their kings and the peoples of the land, to deal with as they pleased. 
<a name="Ne 9:25"></a><span class="versenum">25</span> They captured fortified cities and fertile land. They took possession of houses full of all sorts of good things &#8211; wells previously dug, vineyards, olive trees, and fruit trees in abundance. They ate until they were full<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,9,932) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,9,932) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,9,932) ><SUP>32</SUP></A> and grew fat. They enjoyed to the full your great goodness.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Ne 9:26"></a><span class="versenum">26</span> &#8220;Nonetheless they grew disobedient and rebelled against you; they disregarded your law.<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,9,933) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,9,933) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,9,933) ><SUP>33</SUP></A> They killed your prophets who had solemnly admonished them in order to cause them to return to you. They committed atrocious blasphemies. 
<a name="Ne 9:27"></a><span class="versenum">27</span> Therefore you delivered them into the hand of their adversaries, who oppressed them. But in the time of their distress they called to you, and you heard from heaven. In your abundant compassion you provided them with deliverers to rescue them from<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,9,934) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,9,934) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,9,934) ><SUP>34</SUP></A> their adversaries.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Ne 9:28"></a><span class="versenum">28</span> &#8220;Then, when they were at rest again, they went back to doing evil before you. Then you abandoned them to<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,9,935) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,9,935) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,9,935) ><SUP>35</SUP></A> their enemies, and they gained dominion over them. When they again cried out to you, in your compassion you heard from heaven and rescued them time and again. 
<a name="Ne 9:29"></a><span class="versenum">29</span> And you solemnly admonished them in order to return them to your law, but they behaved presumptuously and did not obey your commandments. They sinned against your ordinances &#8211; those by which an individual, if he obeys them,<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,9,936) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,9,936) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,9,936) ><SUP>36</SUP></A> will live. They boldly turned from you;<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,9,937) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,9,937) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,9,937) ><SUP>37</SUP></A> they rebelled<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,9,938) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,9,938) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,9,938) ><SUP>38</SUP></A> and did not obey. 
<a name="Ne 9:30"></a><span class="versenum">30</span> You prolonged your kindness<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,9,939) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,9,939) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,9,939) ><SUP>39</SUP></A> with them for many years, and you solemnly admonished them by your Spirit through your prophets. Still they paid no attention,<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,9,940) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,9,940) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,9,940) ><SUP>40</SUP></A> so you delivered them into the hands of the neighboring peoples.<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,9,941) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,9,941) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,9,941) ><SUP>41</SUP></A> 
<a name="Ne 9:31"></a><span class="versenum">31</span> However, due to your abundant mercy you did not do away with them altogether; you did not abandon them. For you are a merciful and compassionate God.</p>
