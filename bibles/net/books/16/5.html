<p class=bodytext><p class="paragraphtitle">Nehemiah Intervenes on behalf of the Oppressed</p><p class="bodytext"><a name="Ne 5:1"></a><span class="versenum">1</span> Then there was a great outcry from the people and their wives against their fellow Jews.<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,5,51) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,5,51) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,5,51) ><SUP>1</SUP></A> 
<a name="Ne 5:2"></a><span class="versenum">2</span> There were those who said, &#8220;With our sons and daughters, we are many. We must obtain<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,5,52) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,5,52) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,5,52) ><SUP>2</SUP></A> grain in order to eat and stay alive.&#8221; 
<a name="Ne 5:3"></a><span class="versenum">3</span> There were others who said, &#8220;We are putting up our fields, our vineyards, and our houses as collateral in order to obtain grain during the famine.&#8221; 
<a name="Ne 5:4"></a><span class="versenum">4</span> Then there were those who said, &#8220;We have borrowed money to pay our taxes to the king<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,5,53) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,5,53) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,5,53) ><SUP>3</SUP></A> on our fields and our vineyards. 
<a name="Ne 5:5"></a><span class="versenum">5</span> And now, though we share the same flesh and blood as our fellow countrymen,<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,5,54) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,5,54) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,5,54) ><SUP>4</SUP></A> and our children are just like their children,<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,5,55) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,5,55) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,5,55) ><SUP>5</SUP></A> still we have found it necessary to subject our sons and daughters to slavery.<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,5,56) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,5,56) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,5,56) ><SUP>6</SUP></A> Some of our daughters have been subjected to slavery, while we are powerless to help,<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,5,57) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,5,57) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,5,57) ><SUP>7</SUP></A> since our fields and vineyards now belong to other people.&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,5,58) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,5,58) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,5,58) ><SUP>8</SUP></A> </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Ne 5:6"></a><span class="versenum">6</span> I was very angry when I heard their outcry and these complaints.<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,5,59) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,5,59) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,5,59) ><SUP>9</SUP></A> 
<a name="Ne 5:7"></a><span class="versenum">7</span> I considered these things carefully<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,5,510) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,5,510) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,5,510) ><SUP>10</SUP></A> and then registered a complaint with the wealthy<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,5,511) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,5,511) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,5,511) ><SUP>11</SUP></A> and the officials. I said to them, &#8220;Each one of you is seizing the collateral<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,5,512) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,5,512) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,5,512) ><SUP>12</SUP></A> from your own countrymen!&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,5,513) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,5,513) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,5,513) ><SUP>13</SUP></A> Because of them I called for<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,5,514) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,5,514) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,5,514) ><SUP>14</SUP></A> a great public assembly. 
<a name="Ne 5:8"></a><span class="versenum">8</span> I said to them, &#8220;To the extent possible we have bought back our fellow Jews<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,5,515) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,5,515) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,5,515) ><SUP>15</SUP></A> who had been sold to the Gentiles. But now you yourselves want to sell your own countrymen,<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,5,516) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,5,516) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,5,516) ><SUP>16</SUP></A> so that we can then buy them back!&#8221; They were utterly silent, and could find nothing to say. </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Ne 5:9"></a><span class="versenum">9</span> Then I<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,5,517) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,5,517) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,5,517) ><SUP>17</SUP></A> said, &#8220;The thing that you are doing is wrong!<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,5,518) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,5,518) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,5,518) ><SUP>18</SUP></A> Should you not conduct yourselves<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,5,519) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,5,519) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,5,519) ><SUP>19</SUP></A> in the fear of our God in order to avoid the reproach of the Gentiles who are our enemies? 
<a name="Ne 5:10"></a><span class="versenum">10</span> Even I and my relatives<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,5,520) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,5,520) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,5,520) ><SUP>20</SUP></A> and my associates<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,5,521) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,5,521) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,5,521) ><SUP>21</SUP></A> are lending them money and grain. But let us abandon this practice of seizing collateral!<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,5,522) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,5,522) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,5,522) ><SUP>22</SUP></A> 
<a name="Ne 5:11"></a><span class="versenum">11</span> This very day return to them their fields, their vineyards, their olive trees, and their houses, along with the interest<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,5,523) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,5,523) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,5,523) ><SUP>23</SUP></A> that you are exacting from them on the money, the grain, the new wine, and the olive oil.&#8221; </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Ne 5:12"></a><span class="versenum">12</span> They replied, &#8220;We will return these things,<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,5,524) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,5,524) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,5,524) ><SUP>24</SUP></A> and we will no longer demand anything from them. We will do just as you say.&#8221; Then I called the priests and made the wealthy and the officials<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,5,525) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,5,525) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,5,525) ><SUP>25</SUP></A> swear to do what had been promised.<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,5,526) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,5,526) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,5,526) ><SUP>26</SUP></A> 
<a name="Ne 5:13"></a><span class="versenum">13</span> I also shook out my garment,<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,5,527) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,5,527) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,5,527) ><SUP>27</SUP></A> and I said, &#8220;In this way may God shake out from his house and his property every person who does not carry out<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,5,528) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,5,528) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,5,528) ><SUP>28</SUP></A> this matter. In this way may he be shaken out and emptied!&#8221; All the assembly replied, &#8220;So be it!&#8221; and they praised the <sc>LORD. Then the people did as they had promised.<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,5,529) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,5,529) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,5,529) ><SUP>29</SUP></A></p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Ne 5:14"></a><span class="versenum">14</span> From the day that I was appointed<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,5,530) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,5,530) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,5,530) ><SUP>30</SUP></A> governor<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,5,531) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,5,531) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,5,531) ><SUP>31</SUP></A> in the land of Judah, that is, from the twentieth year until the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes &#8211; twelve years in all &#8211; neither I nor my relatives<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,5,532) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,5,532) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,5,532) ><SUP>32</SUP></A> ate the food allotted to the governor.<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,5,533) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,5,533) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,5,533) ><SUP>33</SUP></A> 
<a name="Ne 5:15"></a><span class="versenum">15</span> But the former governors who preceded me had burdened the people and had taken food and wine from them, in addition to<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,5,534) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,5,534) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,5,534) ><SUP>34</SUP></A> forty shekels of silver. Their associates were also domineering over the people. But I did not behave in this way, due to my fear of God. 
<a name="Ne 5:16"></a><span class="versenum">16</span> I gave myself to the work on this wall, without even purchasing<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,5,535) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,5,535) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,5,535) ><SUP>35</SUP></A> a field. All my associates were gathered there for the work.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Ne 5:17"></a><span class="versenum">17</span> There were 150 Jews and officials who dined with me routinely,<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,5,536) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,5,536) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,5,536) ><SUP>36</SUP></A> in addition to those who came to us from the nations<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,5,537) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,5,537) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,5,537) ><SUP>37</SUP></A> all around us. 
<a name="Ne 5:18"></a><span class="versenum">18</span> Every day one ox, six select sheep, and some birds were prepared for me, and every ten days all kinds of wine in abundance. Despite all this I did not require the food allotted to the governor, for the work was demanding on this people.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Ne 5:19"></a><span class="versenum">19</span> Please remember me for good, O my God, for all that I have done for this people.</p>
