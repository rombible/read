<p class=bodytext><p class="paragraphtitle">Opposition to the Rebuilding Efforts Continues</p><p class="bodytext"><a name="Ne 6:1"></a><span class="versenum">1</span> When Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and the rest of our enemies heard that I had rebuilt the wall and no breach remained in it (even though up to that time I had not positioned doors in the gates), 
<a name="Ne 6:2"></a><span class="versenum">2</span> Sanballat and Geshem sent word to me saying, &#8220;Come on! Let&#8217;s set up a time to meet together at Kephirim<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,6,61) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,6,61) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,6,61) ><SUP>1</SUP></A> in the plain of Ono.&#8221; Now they intended to do me harm.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Ne 6:3"></a><span class="versenum">3</span> So I sent messengers to them saying, &#8220;I am engaged in<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,6,62) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,6,62) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,6,62) ><SUP>2</SUP></A> an important work, and I am unable to come down. Why should the work come to a halt when I leave it to come down to you?&#8221; 
<a name="Ne 6:4"></a><span class="versenum">4</span> They contacted<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,6,63) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,6,63) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,6,63) ><SUP>3</SUP></A> me four times in this way, and I responded the same way each time.<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,6,64) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,6,64) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,6,64) ><SUP>4</SUP></A></p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Ne 6:5"></a><span class="versenum">5</span> The fifth time that Sanballat sent his assistant to me in this way, he had an open letter in his hand. 
<a name="Ne 6:6"></a><span class="versenum">6</span> Written in it were the following words: </p>
<p class="bodytext">&#8220;Among the nations it is rumored<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,6,65) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,6,65) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,6,65) ><SUP>5</SUP></A> (and Geshem<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,6,66) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,6,66) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,6,66) ><SUP>6</SUP></A> has substantiated<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,6,67) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,6,67) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,6,67) ><SUP>7</SUP></A> this) that you and the Jews have intentions of revolting, and for this reason you are building the wall. Furthermore, according to these rumors<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,6,68) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,6,68) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,6,68) ><SUP>8</SUP></A> you are going to become their king. 
<a name="Ne 6:7"></a><span class="versenum">7</span> You have also established prophets to announce<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,6,69) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,6,69) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,6,69) ><SUP>9</SUP></A> in Jerusalem<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,6,610) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,6,610) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,6,610) ><SUP>10</SUP></A> on your behalf, &#8216;We have a king in Judah!&#8217; Now the king is going to hear about these rumors. So come on! Let&#8217;s talk about this.&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,6,611) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,6,611) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,6,611) ><SUP>11</SUP></A> </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Ne 6:8"></a><span class="versenum">8</span> I sent word back to him, &#8220;We are not engaged in these activities you are describing.<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,6,612) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,6,612) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,6,612) ><SUP>12</SUP></A> All of this is a figment of your imagination.&#8221;<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,6,613) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,6,613) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,6,613) ><SUP>13</SUP></A> </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Ne 6:9"></a><span class="versenum">9</span> All of them were wanting<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,6,614) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,6,614) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,6,614) ><SUP>14</SUP></A> to scare us, supposing, &#8220;Their hands will grow slack from the work, and it won&#8217;t get done.&#8221; </p>
<p class="bodytext">So now, strengthen my hands!<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,6,615) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,6,615) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,6,615) ><SUP>15</SUP></A></p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Ne 6:10"></a><span class="versenum">10</span> Then I went to the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel. He was confined to his home.<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,6,616) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,6,616) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,6,616) ><SUP>16</SUP></A> He said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s set up a time to meet in the house of God, within the temple. Let&#8217;s close the doors of the temple, for they are coming to kill you. It will surely be at night that they will come to kill you.&#8221; </p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Ne 6:11"></a><span class="versenum">11</span> But I replied, &#8220;Should a man like me run away? Would someone like me flee to the temple in order to save his life?<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,6,617) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,6,617) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,6,617) ><SUP>17</SUP></A> I will not go!&#8221; 
<a name="Ne 6:12"></a><span class="versenum">12</span> I recognized the fact that God had not sent him, for he had spoken the prophecy against me as a hired agent of Tobiah and Sanballat.<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,6,618) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,6,618) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,6,618) ><SUP>18</SUP></A> 
<a name="Ne 6:13"></a><span class="versenum">13</span> He had been hired to scare me so that I would do this and thereby sin. They would thus bring reproach on me and I<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,6,619) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,6,619) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,6,619) ><SUP>19</SUP></A> would be discredited.<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,6,620) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,6,620) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,6,620) ><SUP>20</SUP></A></p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Ne 6:14"></a><span class="versenum">14</span> Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat in light of these actions of theirs &#8211; also Noadiah the prophetess and the other prophets who were trying to scare me!</p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">The Rebuilding of the Wall Is Finally Completed</p><p class="bodytext">
<a name="Ne 6:15"></a><span class="versenum">15</span> So the wall was completed on the twenty-fifth day of Elul, in just fifty-two days. 
<a name="Ne 6:16"></a><span class="versenum">16</span> When all our enemies heard and all the nations who were around us saw<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,6,621) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,6,621) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,6,621) ><SUP>21</SUP></A> this, they were greatly disheartened.<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,6,622) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,6,622) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,6,622) ><SUP>22</SUP></A> They knew that this work had been accomplished with the help of our God.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<a name="Ne 6:17"></a><span class="versenum">17</span> In those days the aristocrats of Judah repeatedly sent letters to Tobiah, and responses from Tobiah were repeatedly coming to them. 
<a name="Ne 6:18"></a><span class="versenum">18</span> For many in Judah had sworn allegiance to him,<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,6,623) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,6,623) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,6,623) ><SUP>23</SUP></A> because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah son of Arah. His son Jonathan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berechiah. 
<a name="Ne 6:19"></a><span class="versenum">19</span> They were telling me about his good deeds and then taking back to him the things I said.<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,6,624) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,6,624) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,6,624) ><SUP>24</SUP></A> Tobiah, on the other hand, sent letters in order to scare<a onclick=vOpenNote(16,6,625) onmouseleave=vCloseTooltip(event,16,6,625) onmouseenter=vOpenTooltip(event,16,6,625) ><SUP>25</SUP></A> me.</p>
