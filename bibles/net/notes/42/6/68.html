<A NAME="68"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=804><b>sn</b> The alleged violation expressed by the phrase <i>what is against the law </i>is performing work on the Sabbath. That the disciples ate from such a field is no problem given Deut 23:25, but Sabbath activity is another matter in the leaders&#8217; view (Exod 20:8-11 and Mishnah, <i>m. Shabbat </i>7.2). The supposed violation involved reaping, threshing, winnowing, and preparing food. This probably explains why the clause describing the disciples &#8220;rubbing&#8221; the heads of grain in their hands is mentioned last, in emphatic position. This was preparation of food.</p>
