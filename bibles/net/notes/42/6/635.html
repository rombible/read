<A NAME="635"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=831><b>sn</b> With the use of the plural pronoun (&#8220;<i>you</i>&#8221;), Jesus addressed not just the leaders but the crowd with his question to challenge what the leadership was doing. There is irony as well. As Jesus sought to restore on the Sabbath (but improperly according to the leaders&#8217; complaints) the leaders were seeking to destroy, which surely is wrong. The implied critique recalls the OT: Isa 1:1-17; 58:6-14.</p>
