<A NAME="6119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">119</span><note=915><b>sn</b> As the Gospel makes clear, with the statement <i>do not judge</i> Jesus had in mind making a judgment that caused one to cut oneself off from someone so that they ceased to be reached out to (5:27-32; 15:1-32). Jesus himself did make judgments about where people stand (11:37-54), but not in such a way that he ceased to continue to offer them God&#8217;s grace.</p>
