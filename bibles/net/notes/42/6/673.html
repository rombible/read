<A NAME="673"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">73</span><note=869><b>sn</b> The present tense (<i>belongs</i>) here is significant. Jesus makes the kingdom and its blessings currently available. This phrase is unlike the others in the list with the possessive pronoun being emphasized. Jesus was saying, in effect, &#8220;the kingdom belongs even now to people like you.&#8221;</p>
