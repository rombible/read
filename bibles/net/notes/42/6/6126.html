<A NAME="6126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">126</span><note=922><b>sn</b> The picture of <i>a blind man</i> leading <i>a blind man</i> is a warning to watch who one follows: <i>Won&#8217;t they both fall into a pit</i>? The sermon has been about religious choices and reacting graciously to those who oppose the followers of Jesus. Here Jesus&#8217; point was to be careful who you follow and where they are taking you.</p>
