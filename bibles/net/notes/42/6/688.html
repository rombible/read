<A NAME="688"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">88</span><note=884><b>tc</b> The wording &#8220;to you&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8017;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Jumin</font>) is lacking throughout the ms tradition except for a few witnesses (D W* <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#916;</font> 1424 <i>pc</i> co). The Western witnesses tend to add freely to the text. Supported by the vast majority of witnesses and the likelihood that &#8220;to you&#8221; is a clarifying addition, the shorter reading should be considered original; nevertheless, &#8220;to you&#8221; is included in the translation because of English requirements.</p>
