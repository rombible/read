<A NAME="615"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=811><b>tc</b> The Western ms D adds here a full saying that reads, &#8220;On the same day, as he saw someone working on the Sabbath he said, &#8216;Man, if you know what you are doing, you are blessed, but if you do not know, you are cursed and a violator of the law.&#8217;&#8221; Though this is not well enough attested to be considered authentic, many commentators have debated whether this saying might go back to Jesus. Most reject it, though it does have wording that looks like Rom 2:25, 27 and Jas 2:11.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> See 1 Sam 21:1-6.</p>
