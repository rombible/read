<A NAME="6147"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">147</span><note=943><b>sn</b> <i>Why do you call me &#8216;Lord, Lord,&#8217; and don&#8217;t do what I tell you? </i>Respect is not a matter of mere words, but is reflected in obedient action. This short saying, which is much simpler than its more developed conceptual parallel in Matt 7:21-23, serves in this form to simply warn and issue a call to hear and obey, as the last parable also does in vv. 47-49.</p>
