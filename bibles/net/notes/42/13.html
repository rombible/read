<A NAME="132"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1964><b>sn</b> This is an event that otherwise is unattested, though several events similar to it are noted in Josephus (<i>J.

<A NAME="1318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1980><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;each time I inspect it&#8221; is not in the Greek text but has been supplied to indicate the customary nature of the man&#8217;s search for fruit.</p>

This conjunction has the effect of strengthening the logical connection with the preceding statement but also of reducing the rhetorical power and urgency of the imperative. In light of the slightly greater internal probability of adding a conjunction to an otherwise asyndetic sentence, as well as significant external support for the omission (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B D W <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1</sup> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>), the shorter reading appears to be more likely as the original wording here.

<A NAME="1364"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=2026><b>sn</b> Calling the mustard plant a <i>tree</i> is rhetorical hyperbole, since technically it is not one.

The idiomatic expression &#8220;birds of the sky&#8221; refers to wild birds as opposed to domesticated fowl (cf.

<A NAME="1366"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=2028><b>sn</b> The point of the parable seems to be that while the kingdom of God may appear to have insignificant and unnoticeable beginnings (i.e., in the ministry of Jesus), it will someday (i.e., at the second advent) be great and quite expansive. The kingdom, however, is not to be equated with the church, but rather the church is an expression of the kingdom. Also, there is important OT background in the image of the mustard seed that <i>grew and became a tree</i>: Ezek 17:22-24 pictures the reemergence of the Davidic house where people can find calm and shelter. Like the mustard seed, it would start out small but grow to significant size.</p>

<A NAME="1383"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">83</span><note=2045><b>tn</b> The syntactical relationship between vv. 24-25 is disputed. The question turns on whether v. 25 is connected to v. 24 or not. A lack of a clear connective makes an independent idea more likely. However, one must then determine what the beginning of the sentence connects to. Though it makes for slightly awkward English, the translation has opted to connect it to &#8220;he will answer&#8221; so that this functions, in effect, as an apodosis. One could end the sentence after &#8220;us&#8221; and begin a new sentence with &#8220;He will answer&#8221; to make simpler sentences, although the connection between the two sentences is thereby less clear. The point of the passage, however, is clear. Once the door is shut, because one failed to come in through the narrow way, it is closed permanently. The moral: Do not be too late in deciding to respond.</p>

Luke&#8217;s emphasis seems to be on destructiveness, since Herod killed John the Baptist, whom Luke calls &#8220;the greatest born of women&#8221; (Luke 7:28) and later stands opposed to Jesus (Acts 4:26-28). In addition, &#8220;a person who is designated a fox is an insignificant or base person. He lacks real power and dignity, using cunning deceit to achieve his aims&#8221; (H. W.

Notice that Jesus sees himself in the role of a prophet here. Jesus&#8217; statement, <i>it is impossible that a prophet should be killed outside Jerusalem</i>, is filled with irony; Jesus, traveling about in Galilee (most likely), has nothing to fear from Herod; it is his own people living in the very center of Jewish religion and worship who present the greatest danger to his life. The underlying idea is that Jerusalem, though she stands at the very heart of the worship of God, often kills the prophets God sends to her (v. 34). In the end, Herod will be much less a threat than Jerusalem.</p><p class="footnote"><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
