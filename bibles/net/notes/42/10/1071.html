<A NAME="1071"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=1576><b>sn</b> The title <i>Lord</i> is an important name for God, showing his sovereignty, but it is interesting that it comes next to a reference to the <i>Father</i>, a term indicative of God&#8217;s care. The two concepts are often related in the NT; see Eph 1:3-6. </p>
