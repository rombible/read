<A NAME="102"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1507><b>tc</b> There is a difficult textual problem here and in v. 17, where the number is either &#8220;seventy&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A C L W <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#926;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13</sup> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> and several church fathers and early versions) or &#8220;seventy-two&#8221; (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>75</sup> B D 0181 <i>pc </i>lat as well as other versions and fathers). The more difficult reading is &#8220;seventy-two,&#8221; since scribes would be prone to assimilate this passage to several OT passages that refer to groups of seventy people (Num 11:13-17; Deut 10:22; Judg 8:30; 2 Kgs 10:1 <i>et al.</i>); this reading also has slightly better ms support. &#8220;Seventy&#8221; could be the preferred reading if scribes drew from the tradition of the number of translators of the LXX, which the <i>Letter of Aristeas </i>puts at seventy-two (<i>TCGNT</i> 127), although this is far less likely. All things considered, &#8220;seventy-two&#8221; is a much more difficult reading and accounts for the rise of the other. Only Luke notes a second larger mission like the one in 9:1-6.</p>
