<A NAME="10125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">125</span><note=1630><b>sn</b> The neighbor did not do what was required (that is why his response is called <i>mercy</i>) but had compassion and out of kindness went the extra step that shows love. See Mic 6:8. Note how the expert in religious law could not bring himself to admit that the example was a Samaritan, someone who would have been seen as a racial half-breed and one not worthy of respect. So Jesus makes a second point that neighbors may appear in surprising places.</p>
