The longer reading is most likely secondary, though various explanations may account for it (for discussion, see <i>TCGNT</i> 116).</p>
<A NAME="64"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=800><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;heads of grain.&#8221; While the generic term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#964;&#940;&#967;&#965;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">stacus</font>) can refer to the cluster of seeds at the top of grain such as barley or wheat, in the NT the term is restricted to wheat (L&amp;N 3.40; BDAG 941 s.v. 1).</p>
<A NAME="65"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=801><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;picked and ate some heads of grain, rubbing them in their hands.&#8221; The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#968;&#8061;&#967;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ywconte&quot;</font>) has been translated as a finite verb due to requirements of contemporary English style, and the order of the clauses has been transposed to reflect the logical order, which sounds more natural in English.</p>
<A NAME="66"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=802><b>sn</b> See the note on <i>Pharisees</i> in 5:17.</p>
<A NAME="67"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=803><b>tn</b> Note that the verb is second person plural (with an understood plural pronominal subject in Greek). The charge is again indirectly made against Jesus by charging the disciples.</p>
<A NAME="68"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=804><b>sn</b> The alleged violation expressed by the phrase <i>what is against the law </i>is performing work on the Sabbath. That the disciples ate from such a field is no problem given Deut 23:25, but Sabbath activity is another matter in the leaders&#8217; view (Exod 20:8-11 and Mishnah, <i>m. Shabbat </i>7.2). The supposed violation involved reaping, threshing, winnowing, and preparing food. This probably explains why the clause describing the disciples &#8220;rubbing&#8221; the heads of grain in their hands is mentioned last, in emphatic position. This was preparation of food.</p>
<A NAME="69"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=805><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And Jesus.&#8221; Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has not been translated because of differences between Greek and English style.</p>
<A NAME="610"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=806><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Jesus, answering them, said.&#8221; This is redundant in contemporary English and has been simplified to &#8220;Jesus answered them.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="612"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=808><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the bread of presentation.&#8221; </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>The sacred bread</i> refers to the &#8220;bread of presentation,&#8221; &#8220;showbread,&#8221; or &#8220;bread of the Presence,&#8221; twelve loaves prepared weekly for the tabernacle and later, the temple. See Exod 25:30; 35:13; 39:36; Lev 24:5-9. Each loaf was made from 3 quarts (3.5 liters; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;two tenths of an ephah&#8221;) of fine flour. The loaves were placed on a table in the holy place of the tabernacle, on the north side opposite the lampstand (Exod 26:35). It was the duty of the priest each Sabbath to place fresh bread on the table; the loaves from the previous week were then given to Aaron and his descendants, who ate them in the holy place, because they were considered sacred (Lev 24:9). These were the loaves that David requested from Ahimelech for himself and his men (1 Sam 21:1-6; cf. also Matt 12:1-8; Mark 2:23-28).</p>
<A NAME="613"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=809><b>sn</b> Jesus&#8217; response to the charge that what his disciples were doing was <i>not lawful</i> is one of analogy: &#8216;If David did it for his troops in a time of need, then so can I with my disciples.&#8217; Jesus is clear that on the surface there was a violation here. What is not as clear is whether he is arguing a &#8220;greater need&#8221; makes this permissible or that this was within the intention of the law all along.</p>
<A NAME="614"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=810><b>tc</b> Most <sc>mss (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A D <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13</sup> 33 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>) read &#8220;also&#8221; here, but this looks like it is a reading made to agree with Mark 2:26. A better combination of witnesses (B L W <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1</sup> lat sa) lacks the word &#8220;also.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="615"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=811><b>tc</b> The Western ms D adds here a full saying that reads, &#8220;On the same day, as he saw someone working on the Sabbath he said, &#8216;Man, if you know what you are doing, you are blessed, but if you do not know, you are cursed and a violator of the law.&#8217;&#8221; Though this is not well enough attested to be considered authentic, many commentators have debated whether this saying might go back to Jesus. Most reject it, though it does have wording that looks like Rom 2:25, 27 and Jas 2:11.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> See 1 Sam 21:1-6.</p>
<A NAME="616"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=812><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;then&#8221; to indicate the implied sequence of events within the narrative.</p>
<A NAME="617"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=813><b>tn</b> The term &#8220;lord&#8221; is in emphatic position in the Greek text. To make this point even clearer a few <sc>mss add &#8220;also&#8221; before the reference to the Son of Man, while a few others add it before the reference to the Sabbath.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> A second point in Jesus&#8217; defense of his disciples&#8217; actions was that his authority as <i>Son of Man</i> also allowed it, since as Son of Man he was <i>lord of the Sabbath</i>.</p>
<A NAME="618"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=814><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Now it happened that on.&#8221; The introductory phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#947;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#959;</font> (<font face="Greektl">egeneto</font>, &#8220;it happened that&#8221;), common in Luke (69 times) and Acts (54 times), is redundant in contemporary English and has not been translated.</p>

<A NAME="621"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=817><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;now&#8221; to indicate the transition to a new topic. In addition, because the Greek sentence is rather long and complex, a new sentence was started here in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="622"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=818><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;a man was there and his right hand was withered.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Withered</i> means the man&#8217;s hand was shrunken and paralyzed.</p>

<A NAME="624"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=820><b>sn</b> See the note on <i>Pharisees</i> in 5:17.</p>
<A NAME="625"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=821><b>sn</b> The term translated <i>watched&#8230;closely</i> is emotive, since it carries negative connotations. It means they were watching him out of the corner of their eye or spying on him.</p>
<A NAME="626"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=822><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;him&#8221;; the referent (Jesus) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="627"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=823><b>tn</b> This is a first class condition in the Greek text; Jesus&#8217; opponents anticipated he would do this.</p>
<A NAME="628"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=824><b>sn</b> The background for this is the view that only if life was endangered should one attempt to heal on the Sabbath (see the Mishnah, <i>m. Shabbat </i>6.3; 12.1; 18.3; 19.2; <i>m. Yoma</i> 8.6).</p>
<A NAME="629"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=825><b>tn</b> Here the conjunction <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> (<font face="Greektl">de</font>) has been translated as contrastive.</p>
<A NAME="630"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=826><b>sn</b> The statement that Jesus<i> knew their thoughts</i> adds a prophetic note to his response; see Luke 5:22.</p>
<A NAME="631"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=827><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;their reasonings.&#8221; The implication is that Jesus knew his opponents&#8217; plans and motives, so the translation &#8220;thoughts&#8221; was used here.</p>
<A NAME="632"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=828><b>sn</b> Most likely synagogues were arranged with benches along the walls and open space in the center for seating on the floor.</p>
<A NAME="633"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=829><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;so&#8221; to indicate the man&#8217;s action was a result of Jesus&#8217; order. </p>
<A NAME="634"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=830><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> (<font face="Greektl">de</font>) has been translated as &#8220;then&#8221; to indicate the implied sequence of events within the narrative.</p>
<A NAME="635"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=831><b>sn</b> With the use of the plural pronoun (&#8220;<i>you</i>&#8221;), Jesus addressed not just the leaders but the crowd with his question to challenge what the leadership was doing. There is irony as well. As Jesus sought to restore on the Sabbath (but improperly according to the leaders&#8217; complaints) the leaders were seeking to destroy, which surely is wrong. The implied critique recalls the OT: Isa 1:1-17; 58:6-14.</p>
<A NAME="636"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=832><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And after.&#8221; Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has not been translated because of differences between Greek and English style.</p>

It could also be translated as contemporaneous (&#8220;Looking around&#8230; he said&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="638"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=834><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;him&#8221;; the referent (the man with the withered hand) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>

<A NAME="640"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=836><b>sn</b> The passive <i>was restored </i>points to healing by God. Now the question became: Would God exercise his power through Jesus, if what Jesus was doing were wrong? Note also Jesus&#8217; &#8220;labor.&#8221; He simply spoke and it was so.</p>
<A NAME="641"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=837><b>tn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anoia</font>) denotes a kind of insane or mindless fury; the opponents were beside themselves with rage. They could not rejoice in the healing, but could only react against Jesus.</p>
<A NAME="642"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=838><b>tn</b> The use of the optative (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#959;&#953;&#8053;&#963;&#945;&#953;&#949;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">poihsaien</font>, &#8220;might do&#8221;) in an indirect question indicates that the formal opposition and planning of Jesus&#8217; enemies started here (BDF §§385.1; 386.1).</p>
<A NAME="643"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=839><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Now it happened that in.&#8221; The introductory phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#947;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#959;</font> (<font face="Greektl">egeneto</font>, &#8220;it happened that&#8221;), common in Luke (69 times) and Acts (54 times), is redundant in contemporary English and has not been translated.</p>

<A NAME="646"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=842><b>sn</b> This is the only time <i>all night</i> prayer is mentioned in the NT.</p>
<A NAME="647"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=843><b>tn</b> This is an objective genitive, so prayer &#8220;to God.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="649"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=845><b>sn</b> The term <i>apostles</i> is rare in the gospels, found only in Matt 10:2, possibly in Mark 3:14, and six more times in Luke (here plus 9:10; 11:49; 17:5; 22:14; 24:10).</p>
<A NAME="650"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=846><b>sn</b><i> </i>In the various lists of the twelve, <i>Simon</i> (that is, Peter) is always mentioned first (Matt 10:1-4; Mark 3:16-19; Acts 1:13) and the first four are always the same, though not in the same order after Peter.</p>
<A NAME="651"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=847><b>sn</b> <i>Bartholomew</i> (meaning &#8220;son of Tolmai&#8221; in Aramaic) could be another name for Nathanael mentioned in John 1:45.</p>

<A NAME="653"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=849><b>sn</b> The designation <i>Zealot </i>means that Simon was a political nationalist before coming to follow Jesus. He may not have been technically a member of the particular Jewish nationalistic party known as &#8220;Zealots&#8221; (since according to some scholars this party had not been organized at that time), but simply someone who was zealous for Jewish independence from Rome, in which case the descriptive term applied to Simon means something like &#8220;Simon the patriot&#8221; (see L&amp;N 25.77 and especially 11.88).</p>
<A NAME="654"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=850><b>sn</b> There is some debate about what the name <i>Iscariot</i> means. It probably alludes to a region in Judea and thus might make Judas the only non-Galilean in the group. Several explanations for the name <i>Iscariot</i> have been proposed, but it is probably transliterated Hebrew with the meaning &#8220;man of Kerioth&#8221; (there are at least two villages that had that name). For further discussion see D. L. Bock, <i>Luke</i> (BECNT), 1:546; also D. A. Carson, <i>John</i>, 304.</p>

<A NAME="6146"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">146</span><note=942><b>tn</b> The double use of the vocative is normally used in situations of high emotion or emphasis. Even an emphatic confession without action means little.</p>

This short saying, which is much simpler than its more developed conceptual parallel in Matt 7:21-23, serves in this form to simply warn and issue a call to hear and obey, as the last parable also does in vv. 47-49.</p>
