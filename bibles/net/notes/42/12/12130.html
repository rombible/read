<A NAME="12130"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">130</span><note=1948><b>sn</b> The figure of the <i>baptism</i> is variously interpreted, as some see a reference (1) to martyrdom or (2) to inundation with God&#8217;s judgment. The OT background, however, suggests the latter sense: Jesus is about to be uniquely inundated with God&#8217;s judgment as he is rejected, persecuted, and killed (Ps 18:4, 16; 42:7; 69:1-2; Isa 8:7-8; 30:27-28; Jonah 2:3-6).</p>
