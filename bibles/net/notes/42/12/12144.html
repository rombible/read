<A NAME="12144"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">144</span><note=1962><b>tn</b> Here the English word &#8220;cent&#8221; is used as opposed to the parallel in Matt 5:26 where &#8220;penny&#8221; appears, since the Greek word there is different and refers to a different but similar coin.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This <i>cent</i> was a lepton, the smallest coin available. It was copper or bronze, worth one-half of a quadrans or 1/128 of a denarius. The parallel in Matt 5:26 mentions the quadrans instead of the lepton. The illustration refers to the debt one owes God and being sure to settle with him in the right time, before it is too late. Some interpreters, however, consider it to be like Matt 5:26, which has similar imagery but a completely different context.</p>
