<A NAME="1296"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">96</span><note=1914><b>sn</b> <i>The second or third watch of the night</i> would be between 9 p.m. and 3 a.m. on a Roman schedule and 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. on a Jewish schedule. Luke uses the four-watch schedule of the Romans in Acts 12:4, so that is more probable here. Regardless of the precise times of the watches, however, it is clear that the late-night watches when a person is least alert are in view here.</p>
