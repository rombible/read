<A NAME="1222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1840><b>tn</b> Although this is a generic reference and includes both males and females, in this context &#8220;men&#8221; has been retained because of the wordplay with the Son of Man and the contrast with the angels. The same is true of the occurrence of &#8220;men&#8221; in v. 9.</p>
