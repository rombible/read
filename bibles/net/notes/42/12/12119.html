<A NAME="12119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">119</span><note=1937><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;unbelieving.&#8221; Here the translation employs the slightly more ambiguous &#8220;unfaithful,&#8221; which creates a link with the point of the parable &#8211; faithfulness versus unfaithfulness in servants. The example of this verse must be taken together with the examples of vv. 47-48 as part of a scale of reactions with the most disobedient response coming here. The fact that this servant is placed in a distinct group, unlike the one in vv. 47-48, also suggests ultimate exclusion. This is the hypocrite of Matt 24:51.</p>
