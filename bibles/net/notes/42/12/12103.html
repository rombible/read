<A NAME="12103"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">103</span><note=1921><b>sn</b> Is the parable only for disciples (<i>us</i>) or for all humanity (<i>everyone</i>)? Or does Peter mean for disciples (<i>us</i>) or for the crowd (<i>everyone</i>)? The fact that unfaithful slaves are mentioned in v. 46 looks to a warning that includes a broad audience, though it is quality of service that is addressed. This means the parable focuses on those who are associated with Jesus.</p>
