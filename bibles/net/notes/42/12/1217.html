<A NAME="1217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1835><b>sn</b> The word translated <i>hell</i> is &#8220;Gehenna&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#941;&#949;&#957;&#957;&#945;</font>, <font face="Greektl">geenna</font>), a Greek transliteration of the Hebrew words <i>ge hinnom</i> (&#8220;Valley of Hinnom&#8221;). This was the valley along the south side of Jerusalem. In OT times it was used for human sacrifices to the pagan god Molech (cf. Jer 7:31; 19:5-6; 32:35), and it came to be used as a place where human excrement and rubbish were disposed of and burned. In the intertestamental period, it came to be used symbolically as the place of divine punishment (cf. <i>1 En.</i> 27:2, 90:26; <i>4 Ezra</i> 7:36).</p>
