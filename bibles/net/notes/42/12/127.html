<A NAME="127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1825><b>sn</b> I.e., <i>be revealed </i>by God. The passive voice verbs here (&#8220;be revealed,&#8221; be made known&#8221;) see the revelation as coming from God. The text is both a warning about bad things being revealed and an encouragement that good things will be made known, though the stress with the images of darkness and what is hidden in vv. 2-3 is on the attempt to conceal.</p>
