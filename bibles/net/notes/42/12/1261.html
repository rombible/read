<A NAME="1261"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=1879><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;a cubit to his height.&#8221; A cubit (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#8134;&#967;&#965;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">phcu&quot;</font>) can measure length (normally about 45 cm or 18 inches) or time (a small unit, &#8220;hour&#8221; is usually used [BDAG 812 s.v.] although &#8220;day&#8221; has been suggested [L&amp;N 67.151]). The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969;&#955;&#953;&#954;&#943;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jhlikia</font>) is ambiguous in the same way as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#8134;&#967;&#965;&#962;</font>. Most scholars take the term to describe age or length of life here, although a few refer it to bodily stature (see BDAG 435-36 s.v. 1.a for discussion). Worry about length of life seems a more natural figure than worry about height. However, the point either way is clear: Worrying adds nothing to life span or height.</p>
