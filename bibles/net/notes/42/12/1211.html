<A NAME="1211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1829><b>tn</b> The expression &#8220;proclaimed from the housetops&#8221; is an idiom for proclaiming something publicly (L&amp;N 7.51). Roofs of many first century Jewish houses in Judea and Galilee were flat and had access either from outside or from within the house. Something shouted from atop a house would be heard by everyone in the street below.</p>
