<A NAME="12112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">112</span><note=1930><b>tn</b> The term &#8220;that&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954;&#949;&#8150;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">ekeino&quot;</font>) is used as a catchword to list out, in the form of a number of hypothetical circumstances, what the possible responses of &#8220;that&#8221; servant could be. He could be faithful (vv. 43-44) or totally unfaithful (vv. 45-46). He does not complete his master&#8217;s will with knowledge (v. 47) or from ignorance (v 48). These differences are indicated by the different levels of punishment in vv. 46-48.</p>
