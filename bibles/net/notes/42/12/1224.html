<A NAME="1224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1842><b>sn</b> Blasphemy <i>against the Holy Spirit</i> probably refers to a total rejection of the testimony that the Spirit gives to Jesus and the plan of God. This is not so much a sin of the moment as of one&#8217;s entire life, an obstinate rejection of God&#8217;s message and testimony. Cf. Matt 12:31-32 and Mark 3:28-30.</p>
