<A NAME="2020"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2781><b>tc</b> &#8225; There are several variants here, most of which involve variations in word order that do not affect translation. However, the presence or absence of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#953;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ti&quot;</font>) after <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anqrwpo&quot;</font>), which would be translated &#8220;a certain man,&#8221; does affect translation. The witnesses that have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#953;&#962;</font> include A W <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13</sup> 1241 2542 <i>al</i> sy.

Externally, the evidence is significantly stronger for the omission. Internally, however, there is some pause. A feature unique to Luke-Acts in the NT is to use the construction <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#953;&#962;</font> (cf. 10:30; 12:16; 14:2, 16; 15:11; 16:1; 19:12; Acts 9:33). However, scribes who were familiar with this idiom may have inserted it here. In light of the overwhelming external support for the omission of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#953;&#962;</font>, the shorter reading is preferred. NA<sup>27</sup> places <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#953;&#962;</font> in brackets, indicating some doubts as to its authenticity.</p>
