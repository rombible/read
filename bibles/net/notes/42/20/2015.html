<A NAME="2015"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2776><b>sn</b> Very few questions could have so completely revealed the wicked intentions of the religious leaders. Jesus&#8217; question revealed the motivation of the religious leaders and exposed them for what they really were &#8211; hypocrites. They indicted themselves when they cited only two options and chose neither of them. The point of Luke 20:1-8 is that no matter what Jesus said in response to their question they were not going to believe it and would in the end use it against him.</p>
