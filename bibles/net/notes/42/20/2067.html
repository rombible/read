<A NAME="2067"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=2828><b>sn</b> The<i> Sadducees </i>controlled the official political structures of Judaism at this time, being the majority members of the Sanhedrin. They were known as extremely strict on law and order issues (Josephus, <i>J. W.</i> 2.8.2 [2.119], 2.8.14 [2.164-166]; <i>Ant.</i> 13.5.9 [13.171-173], 13.10.6 [13.293-298], 18.1.2 [18.11], 18.1.4 [18.16-17], 20.9.1 [20.199]; <i>Life</i> 2 [10-11]). They also did not believe in resurrection or in angels, an important detail in v. 36. See also Matt 3:7, 16:1-12, 22:23-34; Mark 12:18-27; Acts 4:1, 5:17, 23:6-8.</p>
