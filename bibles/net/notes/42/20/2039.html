<A NAME="2039"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=2800><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;capstone,&#8221; &#8220;keystone.&#8221; Although these meanings are lexically possible, the imagery in Eph 2:20-22 and 1 Cor 3:11 indicates that the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#949;&#966;&#945;&#955;&#8052; &#947;&#969;&#957;&#943;&#945;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kefalh gwnia&quot;</font>) refers to a cornerstone, not a capstone.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone</i>. The use of Ps 118:22-23 and the &#8220;stone imagery&#8221; as a reference to Christ and his suffering and exaltation is common in the NT (see also Matt 21:42; Mark 12:10; Acts 4:11; 1 Pet 2:6-8; cf. also Eph 2:20). The irony in the use of Ps 118:22-23 here is that in the OT, Israel was the one rejected (or perhaps her king) by the Gentiles, but in the NT it is Jesus who is rejected by Israel.</p>
