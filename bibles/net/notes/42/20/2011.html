<A NAME="2011"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2772><b>sn</b> John, like Jesus, was not a part of the official rabbinic order. So the question &#8220;<i>John&#8217;s baptism &#8211; was it from heaven or from men?</i>&#8221; draws an analogy between John the Baptist and Jesus. See Luke 3:1-20; 7:24-27. The phrase <i>John&#8217;s baptism </i>refers to the baptism practiced by John.</p>
