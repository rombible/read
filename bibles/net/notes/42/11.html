<A NAME="115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1654><b>sn</b> It was not unusual for Jewish groups to have their own prayer as a way of expressing corporate identity.

Given this more weighty external evidence, combined with the scribal tendency to harmonize Gospel parallels, the shorter reading is preferred.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> God is addressed in terms of intimacy (<i>Father</i>). The original Semitic term here was probably <i>Abba</i>. The term is a little unusual in a personal prayer, especially as it lacks qualification. It is not the exact equivalent of &#8220;Daddy&#8221; (as is sometimes popularly suggested), but it does suggest a close, familial relationship.</p>

Various suggestions include &#8220;daily,&#8221; &#8220;the coming day,&#8221; and &#8220;for existence.&#8221; See BDAG 376 s.v.; L&amp;N 67:183, 206.</p>

<A NAME="1118"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1667><b>sn</b> The background to the statement <i>I have nothing to set before him</i> is that in ancient Middle Eastern culture it was a matter of cultural honor to be a good host to visitors.</p>
<A NAME="1119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1668><b>tn</b> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#922;&#7936;&#954;&#949;&#8150;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kakeino&quot;</font>) has been translated &#8220;Then he.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="1121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1670><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;my children are with me in the bed.&#8221; In Jewish homes in the time of Jesus, the beds were often all together in one room; thus the householder may be speaking of individual beds (using a collective singular) rather than a common bed.</p>
<A NAME="1122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1671><b>tn</b> The syntax of vv. 6-7 is complex. In the Greek text Jesus&#8217; words in v. 6 begin as a question. Some see Jesus&#8217; question ending at v. 6, but the reply starting in v. 8 favors extending the question through the entire illustration. The translation breaks up the long sentence at the beginning of v. 7 and translates Jesus&#8217; words as a statement for reasons of English style. </p>
<A NAME="1123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1672><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (the man in bed in the house) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1673><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;his&#8221;; the referent (the first man mentioned) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1674><b>tn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#945;&#943;&#948;&#949;&#953;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anaideia</font>) is hard to translate. It refers to a combination of ideas, a boldness that persists over time, or &#8220;audacity,&#8221; which comes close. It most likely describes the one making the request, since the unit&#8217;s teaching is an exhortation about persistence in prayer. Some translate the term &#8220;shamelessness&#8221; which is the term&#8217;s normal meaning, and apply it to the neighbor as an illustration of God responding for the sake of his honor. But the original question was posed in terms of the first man who makes the request, not of the neighbor, so the teaching underscores the action of the one making the request.</p>
<A NAME="1126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1675><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>, from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#947;&#8061;</font> [<font face="Greektl">kagw</font>]) has been translated as &#8220;so&#8221; to indicate the conclusion drawn from the preceding parable. </p>
<A NAME="1127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1676><b>sn</b> The three present imperatives in this verse (<i>Ask&#8230;seek&#8230;knock</i>) are probably intended to call for a repeated or continual approach before God.</p>

<A NAME="1136"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1685><b>sn</b> The provision of the <i>Holy Spirit</i> is probably a reference to the wisdom and guidance supplied in response to repeated requests. Some apply it to the general provision of the Spirit, but this would seem to look only at one request in a context that speaks of repeated asking. The teaching as a whole stresses not that God gives everything his children want, but that God gives the good that they need. The parallel account in Matthew (7:11) refers to <i>good things</i> where Luke mentions the <i>Holy Spirit</i>.</p>
<A NAME="1137"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1686><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;now&#8221; to indicate the transition to a new topic. </p>
<A NAME="1138"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1687><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;a demon that was mute&#8221; should probably be understood to mean that the demon caused muteness or speechlessness in its victim, although it is sometimes taken to refer to the demon&#8217;s own inability to speak (cf. TEV, &#8220;a demon that could not talk&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="1139"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1688><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And it happened that when.&#8221; The introductory phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#947;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#959;</font> (<font face="Greektl">egeneto</font>, &#8220;it happened that&#8221;), common in Luke (69 times) and Acts (54 times), is redundant in contemporary English and has not been translated. Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> (<font face="Greektl">de</font>) has not been translated either.</p>
<A NAME="1140"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1689><b>sn</b> This miracle is different from others in Luke.

<A NAME="1144"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1693><b>tn</b> The pronoun &#8220;him&#8221; is not in the Greek text, but is implied. Direct objects were frequently omitted in Greek when clear from the context.</p>
<A NAME="1145"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1694><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;seeking from him.&#8221; The imperfect <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#950;&#8053;&#964;&#959;&#965;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ezhtoun</font>) is taken ingressively.

<A NAME="1146"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1695><b>sn</b> What exactly this <i>sign </i>would have been, given what Jesus was already doing, is not clear. But here is where the fence-sitters reside, refusing to commit to him.</p>

<A NAME="1148"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1697><b>sn</b> Jesus here demonstrated the absurdity of the thinking of those who maintained that he was in league with Satan and that he actually derived his power from the devil. He first teaches (vv. 17-20) that if he casts out demons by the ruler of the demons, then in reality Satan is fighting against himself, with the result that his kingdom has come to an end. He then teaches (v. 21-22) about defeating the strong man to prove that he does not need to align himself with the devil because he is more powerful. Jesus defeated Satan at his temptation (4:1-13) and by his exorcisms he clearly demonstrated himself to be stronger than the devil. The passage reveals the desperate condition of the religious leaders, who in their hatred for Jesus end up attributing the work of the Holy Spirit to Satan.</p>
<A NAME="1149"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=1698><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;is left in ruins.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1150"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=1699><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;and house falls on house.&#8221; This phrase pictures one house collapsing on another, what is called today a &#8220;house of cards.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="1152"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=1701><b>tn</b> This first class condition, the first of three &#8220;if&#8221; clauses in the following verses, presents the example vividly as if it were so. In fact, all three conditions in these verses are first class. The examples are made totally parallel. The expected answer is that Satan&#8217;s kingdom will not stand, so the suggestion makes no sense. Satan would not seek to heal.</p>
<A NAME="1153"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=1702><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;because.&#8221; &#8220;I ask you this&#8221; is supplied for the sake of English.</p>
<A NAME="1154"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=1703><b>sn</b> Most read <i>your sons</i> as a reference to Jewish exorcists (cf. &#8220;your followers,&#8221; L&amp;N 9.4; for various views see D. L. Bock, <i>Luke</i> [BECNT], 2:1077-78), but more likely this is a reference to the disciples of Jesus themselves, who are also Jewish and have been healing as well (R. J. Shirock, &#8220;Whose Exorcists are they? The Referents of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#7985; &#965;&#7985;&#959;&#8054; &#8017;&#956;&#8182;&#957;</font> at Matthew 12:27/Luke 11:19,&#8221; <i>JSNT</i> 46 [1992]: 41-51). If this is a reference to the disciples, then Jesus&#8217; point is that it is not only him, but those associated with him whose power the hearers must assess. The following reference to judging also favors this reading. </p>
<A NAME="1155"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=1704><b>tn</b> The pronoun &#8220;them&#8221; is not in the Greek text, but is implied. Direct objects were frequently omitted in Greek when clear from the context.</p>
<A NAME="1156"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=1705><b>sn</b> <i>The finger of God</i> is a figurative reference to God&#8217;s power (L&amp;N 76.3). This phrase was used of God&#8217;s activity during the Exodus (Exod 8:19).</p>
<A NAME="1157"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=1706><b>sn</b> The<i> kingdom of God</i> is a major theme of Jesus. It is a realm in which Jesus rules and to which those who trust him belong. See Luke 6:20; 11:20; 17:20-21.</p>
<A NAME="1158"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=1707><b>tn</b> The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#966;&#952;&#945;&#963;&#949;&#957; &#7952;&#966;&#8127; &#8017;&#956;&#8118;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">efqasen ef</font>&#8217;<font face="Greektl"> Juma&quot;</font>) is important. Does it mean merely &#8220;approach&#8221; (which would be reflected in a translation like &#8220;has come near to you&#8221;) or actually &#8220;come upon&#8221; (as in the translation given above, &#8220;has already overtaken you,&#8221; which has the added connotation of suddenness)? The issue here is like the one in 10:9 (see note there on the phrase &#8220;come on&#8221;). Is the arrival of the kingdom merely anticipated or already in process? Two factors favor arrival over anticipation here. First, the prepositional phrase &#8220;upon you&#8221; suggests arrival (Dan 4:24, 28 Theodotion). Second, the following illustration in vv. 21-23 looks at the healing as portraying Satan being overrun. So the presence of God&#8217;s authority has arrived. See also L&amp;N 13.123 for the translation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#966;&#952;&#940;&#957;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">fqanw</font>) as &#8220;to happen to already, to come upon, to come upon already.&#8221;</p>

Here Jesus commands the Pharisees to give from within themselves to those in need instead of just giving of their possessions. In so doing they would show true inner purity acceptable to God.
