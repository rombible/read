<A NAME="73"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=957><b>sn</b> <i>Capernaum </i>was a town on the northwest shore of the Sea of Galilee, 680 ft (204 m) below sea level. It was a major trade and economic center in the North Galilean region.</p><p class="footnote"><b>map</b> For location see Map1-D2; Map2-C3; Map3-B2.</p>
<A NAME="74"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=958><b>sn</b> A <i>centurion</i> was a noncommissioned officer in the Roman army or one of the auxiliary territorial armies, commanding a <i>centuria</i> of (nominally) 100 men. The responsibilities of centurions were broadly similar to modern junior officers, but there was a wide gap in social status between them and officers, and relatively few were promoted beyond the rank of senior centurion. The Roman troops stationed in Judea were auxiliaries, who would normally be rewarded with Roman citizenship after 25 years of service. Some of the centurions may have served originally in the Roman legions (regular army) and thus gained their citizenship at enlistment. Others may have inherited it, like Paul.</p>
<A NAME="75"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=959><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;there&#8221; is not in the Greek text, but is implied.</p>
<A NAME="76"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=960><b>tn</b> Though <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#959;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">doulos</font>) is normally translated &#8220;servant,&#8221; the word does not bear the connotation of a free individual serving another. BDAG notes that &#8220;&#8216;servant&#8217; for &#8216;slave&#8217; is largely confined to Biblical transl. and early American times&#8230; in normal usage at the present time the two words are carefully distinguished&#8221; (BDAG 260 s.v. 1). The most accurate translation is &#8220;bondservant&#8221; (sometimes found in the ASV for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#959;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font>) in that it often indicates one who sells himself into slavery to another. But as this is archaic, few today understand its force. In addition, the parallel passage in Matt 8:6 uses the Greek term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#8150;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pais</font>), to refer to the centurion&#8217;s slave. This was a term often used of a slave who was regarded with some degree of affection, possibly a personal servant.</p>
<A NAME="77"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=961><b>tn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#956;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">entimos</font>) could mean &#8220;highly valued,&#8221; but this sounds too much like the slave was seen as an asset, while the text suggests a genuine care for the person. More archaically, it could be said the centurion was fond of this slave.</p>
<A NAME="78"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=962><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (the centurion) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>

<A NAME="710"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=964><b>sn</b> Why <i>some Jewish elders</i> are sent as emissaries is not entirely clear, but the centurion was probably respecting ethnic boundaries, which were important in ancient Greco-Roman and Jewish culture. The parallel account in Matt 8:5-13 does not mention the emissaries.</p>
<A NAME="711"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=965><b>tn</b> The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#955;&#952;&#8061;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">elqwn</font>) has been translated as an infinitive in parallel with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#945;&#963;&#8061;&#963;&#8131;</font> (<font face="Greektl">diaswsh</font>) due to requirements of contemporary English style.</p>

<A NAME="714"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=968><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;implored.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="716"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=970><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Worthy is he to have you do this&#8221;; the term &#8220;worthy&#8221; comes first in the direct discourse and is emphatic.</p>
<A NAME="717"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=971><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;people.&#8221; The use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#952;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">eqnos</font>, &#8220;nation&#8221;) here instead of &#8220;God&#8221; probably meant the man was not a full proselyte, but that he had simply been supportive of the Jews and their culture. He could have been a God-fearer. The Romans saw a stable religious community as politically helpful and often supported it (Josephus, <i>Ant. </i>16.6.2 [16.162-165], 19.6.3 [19.300-311]).</p>
<A NAME="718"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=972><b>tn</b> In the Greek text, the pronoun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">autos</font>) is included, making this emphatic. Naturally the force of this statement is causative, meaning the centurion either had the synagogue built or donated the cost of its construction.</p>
<A NAME="719"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=973><b>sn</b> See the note on <i>synagogues</i> in 4:15.</p>

<A NAME="723"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=977><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;do not be bothered.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="724"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=978><b>sn</b> Note the humility in the centurion&#8217;s statement <i>I am not worthy</i> in light of what others think (as v. 4 notes). See Luke 5:8 for a similar example of humility.</p>
<A NAME="725"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=979><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;roof; therefore.&#8221;</p>

This is most likely an assimilation to Matt 8:8, and thus, as a motivated reading, should be considered secondary. The meaning either way is essentially the same.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> The aorist imperative may be translated as an imperative of command (&#8220;must be healed&#8221; or, more periphrastically, &#8220;command [my servant] to be healed&#8221;) or as a permissive imperative (&#8220;let my servant be healed&#8221;), which lessens the force of the imperative somewhat in English.</p>

Since the centurion was a commander of a hundred soldiers, he understood what it was both to command others and to be obeyed.</p>
<A NAME="730"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=984><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;it&#8221; is not in the Greek text, but is implied. Direct objects were frequently omitted in Greek when clear from the context.</p>

<A NAME="732"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=986><b>sn</b> There are two elements to the <i>faith</i> that Jesus commended: The man&#8217;s humility and his sense of Jesus&#8217; authority which recognized that only Jesus&#8217; word, not his physical presence, were required.</p>

But these readings are decidedly secondary, for they are more specific than Luke usually is, and involve an unparalleled construction (viz., article + <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969;&#956;&#941;&#961;&#945;</font> [<font face="Greektl">Jhmera</font>] + <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7953;&#958;&#8134;&#962;</font>; elsewhere, when Luke uses this adverb, the noun it modifies is either implied or <i>after</i> the adverb [cf. Luke 9:37; Acts 21:1; 25:17; 27:18)]. The reading adopted for the translation is a more general time indicator; the article <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8183;</font> modifies an implied <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#967;&#961;&#972;&#957;&#8179;</font> (<font face="Greektl">cronw</font>), with the general sense of &#8220;soon afterward.&#8221;</p>

For similar examples of an &#8220;evidentiary&#8221; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font>, cf. Luke 1:22; 6:21; 13:2. See discussion in D. L. Bock, <i>Luke </i>[BECNT], 1:703-5. Further evidence that this is the case here is the final statement: &#8220;the one who is forgiven little loves little&#8221; means that the one who is forgiven little is thus not able to love much. The REB renders this verse: &#8220;her great love proves that her many sins have been forgiven; where little has been forgiven, little love is shown.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>She loved much. </i>Jesus&#8217; point is that the person who realizes how great a gift forgiveness is (because they have a deep sense of sin) has a great love for the one who forgives, that is, God.
