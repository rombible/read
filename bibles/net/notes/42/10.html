<A NAME="101"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1506><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And after these things.&#8221; Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> (<font face="Greektl">de</font>) has not been translated.</p>
<A NAME="102"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1507><b>tc</b> There is a difficult textual problem here and in v. 17, where the number is either &#8220;seventy&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A C L W <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#926;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13</sup> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> and several church fathers and early versions) or &#8220;seventy-two&#8221; (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>75</sup> B D 0181 <i>pc </i>lat as well as other versions and fathers). The more difficult reading is &#8220;seventy-two,&#8221; since scribes would be prone to assimilate this passage to several OT passages that refer to groups of seventy people (Num 11:13-17; Deut 10:22; Judg 8:30; 2 Kgs 10:1 <i>et al.</i>); this reading also has slightly better ms support. &#8220;Seventy&#8221; could be the preferred reading if scribes drew from the tradition of the number of translators of the LXX, which the <i>Letter of Aristeas </i>puts at seventy-two (<i>TCGNT</i> 127), although this is far less likely. All things considered, &#8220;seventy-two&#8221; is a much more difficult reading and accounts for the rise of the other. Only Luke notes a second larger mission like the one in 9:1-6.</p>

Here the expression refers to someone who responds positively to the disciples&#8217; message, like &#8220;wisdom&#8217;s child&#8221; in Luke 7:30.</p>

<A NAME="1027"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1532><b>sn</b> The<i> kingdom of God</i> is a major theme of Jesus. It is a realm in which Jesus rules and to which those who trust him belong. See Luke 6:20; 11:20; 17:20-21.</p>
<A NAME="1028"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1533><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;come <i>near</i> <i>to</i> you,&#8221; suggesting the approach (but not arrival) of the kingdom. But the combination of the perfect tense of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#947;&#947;&#943;&#950;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">engizw</font>) with the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#960;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">epi</font>) most likely suggests that the sense is &#8220;has come upon&#8221; (see BDAG 270 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#947;&#947;&#943;&#950;&#969;</font> 2; W.

These passages argue that a key element of the kingdom is its ability to overcome the power of Satan and those elements in the creation that oppose humanity. Confirmation of this understanding comes in v. 18 and in Luke 11:14-23, especially the parable of vv. 21-23.</p>

<A NAME="1038"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1543><b>sn</b> The allusion to <i>Sodom</i>, the most wicked of OT cities from Gen 19:1-29, shows that to reject the current message is even more serious than the worst sins of the old era and will result in more severe punishment.
