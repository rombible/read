<A NAME="817"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1135><b>sn</b> <i>A sower went out to sow. </i>The background for this well-known parable is a field through which a well-worn path runs in the Palestinian countryside. Sowing would occur in late fall or early winter (October to December) in the rainy season, looking for sprouting in April or May and a June harvest. The use of seed as a figure for God&#8217;s giving life has OT roots: Isa 55:10-11.</p>
