<A NAME="898"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">98</span><note=1216><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;What to me and to you?&#8221; (an idiom). The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#943; &#7952;&#956;&#959;&#8054; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#963;&#959;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ti emoi kai soi</font>) is Semitic in origin, though it made its way into colloquial Greek (BDAG 275 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#947;&#8061;</font>). The equivalent Hebrew expression in the OT had two basic meanings: (1) When one person was unjustly bothering another, the injured party could say &#8220;What to me and to you?&#8221; meaning, &#8220;What have I done to you that you should do this to me?&#8221; (Judg 11:12; 2 Chr 35:21; 1 Kgs 17:18). (2) When someone was asked to get involved in a matter he felt was no business of his own, he could say to the one asking him, &#8220;What to me and to you?&#8221; meaning, &#8220;That is your business, how am I involved?&#8221; (2 Kgs 3:13; Hos 14:8). These nuances were apparently expanded in Greek, but the basic notions of defensive hostility (option 1) and indifference or disengagement (option 2) are still present. BDAG suggests the following as glosses for this expression: <i>What have I to do with you? What have we in common? Leave me alone! Never mind! </i>Hostility between Jesus and the demons is certainly to be understood in this context, hence the translation: &#8220;Leave me alone&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
