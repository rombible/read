<A NAME="8118"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">118</span><note=1236><b>sn</b> Many have discussed why Jesus <i>gave them permission</i>, since the animals were destroyed. However, this is another example of a miracle that is a visual lesson. The demons are destructive: They were destroying the man. They destroyed the pigs. They destroy whatever they touch. The point was to take demonic influence seriously, as well as Jesus&#8217; power over it as a picture of the larger battle for human souls. There would be no doubt how the man&#8217;s transformation had taken place.</p>
