<A NAME="8100"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">100</span><note=1218><b>sn</b> The demons&#8217; plea &#8220;<i>do not torment me</i>&#8221;<i> </i>is a recognition of Jesus&#8217; inherent authority over evil forces. The request is that Jesus not bother them. There was an appointed time in which demons would face their judgment, and they seem to have viewed Jesus&#8217; arrival on the scene as an illegitimate change in God&#8217;s plan regarding the time when their sentence would be executed.</p>
