<A NAME="89"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1127><b>sn</b> This <i>Mary </i>is not the woman mentioned in the previous passage (as some church fathers claimed), because she is introduced as a new figure here. In addition, she is further specified by Luke with the notation <i>called Magdalene</i>, which seems to distinguish her from the woman at Simon the Pharisee&#8217;s house.</p>
