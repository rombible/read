<A NAME="861"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=1179><b>sn</b> The phrase <i>what he thinks he has </i>is important, because it is not what a person thinks he has that is important but whether he actually has something or not. Jesus describes the person who does not heed his word as having nothing. The person who has nothing loses even that which he thought was something but was not. In other words, he has absolutely nothing at all. Jesus&#8217; teaching must be taken seriously.</p>
