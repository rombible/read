<A NAME="867"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=1185><b>tn</b> There is some discussion about the grammar of this verse in Greek. If &#8220;these&#8221; is the subject, then it reads, &#8220;These are my mother and brothers, those who.&#8221; If &#8220;these&#8221; is a nominative absolute, which is slightly more likely, then the verse more literally reads, &#8220;So my mother and brothers, they are those who.&#8221; The sense in either case is the same.</p>
