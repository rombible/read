<a name="1114"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">114</span><note=114><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the one born holy will be called the Son of God.&#8221; The wording of this phrase depends on whether the adjective is a predicate adjective, as in the text, or is an adjective modifying the participle serving as the subject. The absence of an article with the adjective speaks for a predicate position. Other less appealing options supply a verb for &#8220;holy&#8221;; thus &#8220;the one who is born will be holy&#8221;; or argue that both &#8220;holy&#8221; and &#8220;Son of God&#8221; are predicates, so &#8220;The one who is born will be called holy, the Son of God.&#8221;</p>
