<a name="1203"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">203</span><note=203><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;heart.&#8221; The term &#8220;heart&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#961;&#948;&#943;&#945;</font>, <font face="Greektl">kardia</font>) could also be translated as &#8220;mind,&#8221; or &#8220;thoughts,&#8221; and the entire phrase be rendered as &#8220;kept them in mind,&#8221; &#8220;thought about,&#8221; or the like. But the immediate context is clearly emotive, suggesting that much more is at work than merely the mental processes of thinking or reasoning about &#8220;these things.&#8221; There is a sense of joy and excitement (see the following question, &#8220;What then will this child be?&#8221;) and even fear. Further, the use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#961;&#948;&#943;&#945;</font> in 1:66 suggests connections with the same term in 2:19 where deep emotion is being expressed as well. Therefore, recognizing both the dramatic nature of the immediate context and the literary connections to 2:19, the translation renders the term in 1:66 as &#8220;hearts&#8221; to capture both the cognitive and emotive aspects of the people&#8217;s response.</p>
