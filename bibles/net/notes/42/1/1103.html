The Greek form of the name <font face="Greektl">Ihsous</font>, which was translated into Latin as <i>Jesus</i>, is the same as the Hebrew <font face="Scholar">Yeshua</font> (Joshua), which means &#8220;Yahweh saves&#8221; (Yahweh is typically rendered as &#8220;Lord&#8221; in the OT). It was a fairly common name among Jews in 1st century Palestine, as references to a number of people by this name in the LXX and Josephus indicate.</p>
