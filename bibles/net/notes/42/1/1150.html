<a name="1150"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">150</span><note=150><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;rejoices.&#8221; The translation renders this aorist, which stands in contrast to the previous line&#8217;s present tense, as ingressive, which highlights Mary&#8217;s joyous reaction to the announcement. A comprehensive aorist is also possible here.</p>
