<a name="1149"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">149</span><note=149><b>sn</b> This psalm (vv. 46-55) is one of the few praise psalms in the NT. Mary praises God and then tells why both in terms of his care for her (vv. 46-49) and for others, including Israel (vv. 50-55). Its traditional name, the &#8220;<i>Magnificat</i>,&#8221; comes from the Latin for the phrase <i>My soul magnifies the Lord</i> at the hymn&#8217;s start.</p>
