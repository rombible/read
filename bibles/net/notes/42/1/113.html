<a name="113"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=13><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;know the truth about&#8221;; or &#8220;know the certainty of.&#8221; The issue of the context is psychological confidence; Luke&#8217;s work is trying to encourage Theophilus. So in English this is better translated as &#8220;know for certain&#8221; than &#8220;know certainty&#8221; or &#8220;know the truth,&#8221; which sounds too cognitive. &#8220;Certain&#8221; assumes the truth of the report. On this term, see Acts 2:36; 21:34; 22:30; and 25:26. The meaning &#8220;have assurance concerning&#8221; is also possible here.</p>
