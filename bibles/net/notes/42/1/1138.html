<a name="1138"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">138</span><note=138><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;From where this to me?&#8221; The translation suggests the note of humility and surprise that Elizabeth feels in being a part of these events. The <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jina</font>) clause which follows explains what &#8220;this&#8221; is. A literal translation would read &#8220;From where this to me, that is, that the mother of my Lord comes to visit me?&#8221;</p>
