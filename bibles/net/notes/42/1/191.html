<a name="191"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">91</span><note=91><b>tn</b> The address, &#8220;favored one&#8221; (a perfect participle, <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Oh one who is favored&#8221;) points to Mary as the recipient of God&#8217;s grace, not a bestower of it. She is a model saint in this passage, one who willingly receives God&#8217;s benefits. The Vulgate rendering &#8220;full of grace&#8221; suggests something more of Mary as a bestower of grace, but does not make sense here contextually.</p>
