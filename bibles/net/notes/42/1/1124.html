<a name="1124"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">124</span><note=124><b>tn</b> Traditionally, &#8220;handmaid&#8221;; <i>Grk</i> &#8220;slave woman.&#8221; Though <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#959;&#973;&#955;&#951;</font> (<font face="Greektl">doulh</font>) is normally translated &#8220;woman servant,&#8221; the word does not bear the connotation of a free woman serving another. BDAG notes that &#8220;&#8216;servant&#8217; for &#8216;slave&#8217; is largely confined to Biblical transl. and early American times&#8230; in normal usage at the present time the two words are carefully distinguished&#8221; (BDAG 260 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#959;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font>). The most accurate translation is &#8220;bondservant,&#8221; sometimes found in the ASV for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#959;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">doulos</font>), in that it often indicates one who sells himself or herself into slavery to another. But as this is archaic, few today understand its force.</p>
