It is the verb &#8220;undertaken&#8221; which suggests a written account, since it literally is &#8220;to set one&#8217;s hand&#8221; to something (BDAG 386 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#941;&#969;</font>). &#8220;Narrative&#8221; is too specific, denoting a particular genre of work for the accounts that existed in the earlier tradition. Not all of that material would have been narrative.</p>
