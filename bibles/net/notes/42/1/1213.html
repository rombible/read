<a name="1213"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">213</span><note=213><b>sn</b> The<i> horn of salvation </i>is a figure that refers to the power of Messiah and his ability to protect, as the horn refers to what an animal uses to attack and defend (Ps 75:4-5, 10; 148:14; 2 Sam 22:3). Thus the meaning of the figure is &#8220;a powerful savior.&#8221;</p>
