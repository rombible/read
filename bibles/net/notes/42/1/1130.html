<a name="1130"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">130</span><note=130><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And it happened that.&#8221; The introductory phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#947;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#959;</font> (<font face="Greektl">egeneto</font>, &#8220;it happened that&#8221;), common in Luke (69 times) and Acts (54 times), is redundant in contemporary English and has not been translated. Because of the difference between Greek style, which often begins sentences or clauses with &#8220;and,&#8221; and English style, which generally does not, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has not been translated here either.</p>
