<A NAME="545"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=695><b>sn</b> The silence <i>ordered</i> by Jesus was probably meant to last only until the cleansing took place with the priests and sought to prevent Jesus&#8217; healings from becoming the central focus of the people&#8217;s reaction to him.
