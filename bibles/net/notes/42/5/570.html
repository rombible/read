<A NAME="570"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">70</span><note=720><b>tn</b> There is a translational problem at this point in the text. The term Luke uses is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#941;&#961;&#945;&#956;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">keramo&quot;</font>). It can in certain contexts mean &#8220;clay,&#8221; but usually this is in reference to pottery (see BDAG 540 s.v. 1). The most natural definition in this instance is &#8220;roof tile&#8221; (used in the translation above). However, tiles were generally not found in Galilee. Recent archaeological research has suggested that this house, which would have probably been typical for the area, could not have supported &#8220;a second story, nor could the original roof have been masonry; no doubt it was made from beams and branches of trees covered with a mixture of earth and straw&#8221; (J. F. Strange and H. Shanks, &#8220;Has the House Where Jesus Stayed in Capernaum Been Found?&#8221; <i>BAR </i>8, no. 6 [Nov/Dec 1982]: 34). Luke may simply have spoken of building materials that would be familiar to his readers.</p>
