<A NAME="585"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">85</span><note=735><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;reasonings.&#8221; This is the noun form of the infinitive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#943;&#950;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">dialogizesqai</font>, &#8220;began to reason to themselves&#8221;) used in v. 21. Jesus&#8217; reply to them in the latter part of the present verse makes clear that these reasonings were mental and internal, so the translation &#8220;thoughts&#8221; was used here. On the hostile or evil nature of these thoughts, see G. Schrenk, <i>TDNT</i> 2:97.</p>
