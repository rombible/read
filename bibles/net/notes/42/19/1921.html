<A NAME="1921"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2643><b>sn</b> Zacchaeus was a penitent man who resolved on the spot to act differently in the face of Jesus&#8217; acceptance of him. In resolving to <i>give</i> half his <i>possessions </i>to the poor, Zacchaeus was not defending himself against the crowd&#8217;s charges and claiming to be righteous. Rather as a result of this meeting with Jesus, he was a changed individual. So Jesus could speak of salvation coming that day (v. 9) and of the lost being saved (v. 10).</p>
