<A NAME="1961"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=2683><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;man, taking out.&#8221; The Greek word can refer to withdrawing money from a bank (L&amp;N 57.218), and in this context of financial accountability that is the most probable meaning. Because of the length and complexity of the Greek sentence, a new sentence was started here in the translation by supplying the pronoun &#8220;you&#8221; as subject and translating the participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#7988;&#961;&#949;&#953;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">airei&quot;</font>) as a finite verb.</p>
