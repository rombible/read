<A NAME="19120"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">120</span><note=2742><b>sn</b> Jesus now predicted the events that would be fulfilled in the fall of Jerusalem in <sc>a.d. 70. The details of the siege have led some to see Luke writing this after Jerusalem&#8217;s fall, but the language of the verse is like God&#8217;s exilic judgment for covenant unfaithfulness (Hab 2:8; Jer 6:6, 14; 8:13-22; 9:1; Ezek 4:2; 26:8; Isa 29:1-4). Specific details are lacking and the procedures described (<i>build an embankment against you</i>) were standard Roman military tactics.</p>
