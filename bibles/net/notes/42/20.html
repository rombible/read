<A NAME="2011"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2772><b>sn</b> John, like Jesus, was not a part of the official rabbinic order.

<A NAME="2015"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2776><b>sn</b> Very few questions could have so completely revealed the wicked intentions of the religious leaders. Jesus&#8217; question revealed the motivation of the religious leaders and exposed them for what they really were &#8211; hypocrites. They indicted themselves when they cited only two options and chose neither of them. The point of Luke 20:1-8 is that no matter what Jesus said in response to their question they were not going to believe it and would in the end use it against him.</p>

Externally, the evidence is significantly stronger for the omission. Internally, however, there is some pause. A feature unique to Luke-Acts in the NT is to use the construction <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#953;&#962;</font> (cf. 10:30; 12:16; 14:2, 16; 15:11; 16:1; 19:12; Acts 9:33). However, scribes who were familiar with this idiom may have inserted it here. In light of the overwhelming external support for the omission of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#953;&#962;</font>, the shorter reading is preferred. NA<sup>27</sup> places <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#953;&#962;</font> in brackets, indicating some doubts as to its authenticity.</p>
<A NAME="2021"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2782><b>sn</b><i> </i>The <i>vineyard</i> is a figure for Israel in the OT (Isa 5:1-7).

The aorist subjunctive is expected following <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">{ina</font>, &#8220;so that&#8221;), so it is almost surely a motivated reading. Further, early and excellent witnesses, as well as a few others (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A B <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13</sup> 33 579 1241 2542 <i>al</i>), have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#8061;&#963;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#957;</font>.

The use of Ps 118:22-23 and the &#8220;stone imagery&#8221; as a reference to Christ and his suffering and exaltation is common in the NT (see also Matt 21:42; Mark 12:10; Acts 4:11; 1 Pet 2:6-8; cf. also Eph 2:20). The irony in the use of Ps 118:22-23 here is that in the OT, Israel was the one rejected (or perhaps her king) by the Gentiles, but in the NT it is Jesus who is rejected by Israel.</p>

They also did not believe in resurrection or in angels, an important detail in v. 36. See also Matt 3:7, 16:1-12, 22:23-34; Mark 12:18-27; Acts 4:1, 5:17, 23:6-8.</p>

<A NAME="2073"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">73</span><note=2834><b>sn</b> A quotation from Deut 25:5. Because the OT quotation does not include &#8220;a wife&#8221; as the object of the verb, it has been left as normal type. This practice is called levirate marriage (see also Ruth 4:1-12; Mishnah,<i> m. Yevamot; </i>Josephus<i>, Ant. </i>4.8.23 [4.254-256]). The levirate law is described in Deut 25:5-10. The brother of a man who died without a son had an obligation to marry his brother&#8217;s widow. This served several purposes: It provided for the widow in a society where a widow with no children to care for her would be reduced to begging, and it preserved the name of the deceased, who would be regarded as the legal father of the first son produced from that marriage.</p>

Jesus was arguing, as the ancient exposition assumed, that the passage is about the Lord&#8217;s anointed. The passage looks at an enthronement of this figure and a declaration of honor for him as he takes his place at the side of God. In Jerusalem, the king&#8217;s palace was located to the right of the temple to indicate this kind of relationship. Jesus was pressing the language here to get his opponents to reflect on how great Messiah is.</p>
