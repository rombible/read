<A NAME="1738"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=2433><b>sn</b> The <i>ten men with leprosy</i> would have been unable to approach Jesus (Lev 13:45-46; Num 5:2-3). The ancient term for leprosy covered a wider array of conditions than what is called leprosy today. A leper was totally ostracized from society until he was declared cured (Lev 13:45-46).</p>
