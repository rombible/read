<A NAME="1730"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2425><b>tn</b> Some translations describe the slaves as &#8220;worthless&#8221; (NRSV) or &#8220;unworthy&#8221; (NASB, NIV) but that is not Jesus&#8217; point. These disciples have not done anything deserving special commendation or praise (L&amp;N 33.361), but only what would normally be expected of a slave in such a situation (thus the translation &#8220;we have only done what was our duty&#8221;).</p>
