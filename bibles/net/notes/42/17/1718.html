<A NAME="1718"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2413><b>tn</b> The passives here (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954;&#961;&#953;&#950;&#8061;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#953;</font> and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#966;&#965;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#953;</font>, <font face="Greektl">ekrizwqhti </font>and <font face="Greektl">futeuqhti</font>) are probably a circumlocution for God performing the action (the so-called divine passive, see <i>ExSyn</i> 437-38). The issue is not the amount of faith (which in the example is only very tiny), but its presence, which can accomplish impossible things. To cause a tree to be uprooted and planted in the sea is impossible. The expression is a rhetorical idiom. It is like saying a camel can go through the eye of a needle (Luke 18:25).</p>
