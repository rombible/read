<A NAME="1750"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=2445><b>sn</b> This is a parenthetical note by the author. The comment that the man was <i>a Samaritan</i> means that to most Jews of Jesus&#8217; day he would have been despised as a half-breed and a heretic. The note adds a touch of irony to the account (v. 18).</p>
