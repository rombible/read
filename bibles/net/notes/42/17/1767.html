<A NAME="1767"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=2462><b>sn</b> This is a reference to the <i>days</i> of the full manifestation of Jesus&#8217; power in a fully established kingdom. The reference to &#8220;days&#8221; instead of &#8220;day&#8221; is unusual, appearing only here and in v. 26, but it may be motivated merely by parallelism with the &#8220;days&#8221; of Noah there and the &#8220;days of Lot&#8221; in v. 28.</p>
