<A NAME="88"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1126><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;illnesses.&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#963;&#952;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#953;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">asqeneia</font>) refers to the state of being ill and thus incapacitated in some way &#8211; &#8220;illness, disability, weakness.&#8221; (L&amp;N 23.143).</p>
<A NAME="89"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1127><b>sn</b> This <i>Mary </i>is not the woman mentioned in the previous passage (as some church fathers claimed), because she is introduced as a new figure here. In addition, she is further specified by Luke with the notation <i>called Magdalene</i>, which seems to distinguish her from the woman at Simon the Pharisee&#8217;s house.</p>

However, as BDAG notes, the office may be political in nature and would then be translated something like &#8220;governor&#8221; or &#8220;procurator.&#8221; Note that in either case the gospel was reaching into the highest levels of society.</p>

From an internal standpoint the singular pronoun looks like an assimilation to texts like Matt 27:55 and Mark 15:41.</p>
<A NAME="814"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1132><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;to him&#8221;; the referent (Jesus) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="815"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1133><b>tn</b> This phrase renders a distributive use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#940;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kata</font>) with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#972;&#955;&#953;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">polis</font>), literally &#8220;according to [each] town.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="816"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1134><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;to them&#8221; do not appear in the Greek text but are supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="817"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1135><b>sn</b> <i>A sower went out to sow. </i>The background for this well-known parable is a field through which a well-worn path runs in the Palestinian countryside. Sowing would occur in late fall or early winter (October to December) in the rainy season, looking for sprouting in April or May and a June harvest. The use of seed as a figure for God&#8217;s giving life has OT roots: Isa 55:10-11.</p>
<A NAME="818"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1136><b>tn</b> Luke&#8217;s version of the parable, like Mark&#8217;s (cf. Mark 4:1-9) uses the collective singular to refer to the seed throughout, so singular pronouns have been used consistently throughout this parable in the English translation. However, the parallel account in Matt 13:1-9 begins with plural pronouns in v. 4 but then switches to the collective singular in v. 5 ff.</p>
<A NAME="819"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1137><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the birds of the sky&#8221; or &#8220;the birds of the heaven&#8221;; the Greek word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8016;&#961;&#945;&#957;&#972;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ouranos</font>) may be translated either &#8220;sky&#8221; or &#8220;heaven,&#8221; depending on the context. The idiomatic expression &#8220;birds of the sky&#8221; refers to wild birds as opposed to domesticated fowl (cf. BDAG 809 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#949;&#964;&#949;&#953;&#957;&#972;&#957;</font>).</p>
<A NAME="820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1138><b>sn</b> The <i>rock</i> in Palestine would be a limestone base lying right under the soil.</p>
<A NAME="821"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1139><b>sn</b> Palestinian weeds like these <i>thorns </i>could grow up to six feet in height and have a major root system.</p>

<A NAME="823"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1141><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;but&#8221; to indicate the contrast present in the final stage of the parable.</p>
<A NAME="824"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1142><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;when it grew, after it grew.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="825"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1143><b>sn</b> Unlike the parallel accounts in Matt 13:8 and Mark 4:8, there is no distinction in yield in this version of the parable.</p>
<A NAME="826"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1144><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;said these things.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="827"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1145><b>tn</b> The translation &#8220;had better listen!&#8221; captures the force of the third person imperative more effectively than the traditional &#8220;let him hear,&#8221; which sounds more like a permissive than an imperative to the modern English reader. This was Jesus&#8217; common expression to listen and heed carefully (cf. Matt 11:15; 13:9, 43; Mark 4:9, 23; Luke 14:35).</p>
<A NAME="828"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1146><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> (<font face="Greektl">de</font>) has been translated as &#8220;then&#8221; to indicate the implied sequence of events within the narrative.</p>
<A NAME="829"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1147><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;what this parable might be&#8221; (an optative after a secondary tense, in keeping with good Koine style).</p>
<A NAME="830"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1148><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> (<font face="Greektl">de</font>) has not been translated.</p>
<A NAME="831"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1149><b>tn</b> This is an example of a so-called &#8220;divine passive,&#8221; with God understood to be the source of the revelation (see <i>ExSyn</i> 437-38).</p>
<A NAME="832"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1150><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;it has been given to you to know.&#8221; The dative pronoun occurs first, in emphatic position in the Greek text, although this position is awkward in contemporary English.</p>
<A NAME="833"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1151><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the mysteries.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The key term <i>secrets</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#965;&#963;&#964;&#8053;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">musthrion</font>) can mean either (1) a new revelation or (2) a revealing interpretation of existing revelation as in Dan 2:17-23, 27-30. Jesus seems to be explaining how current events develop old promises, since the NT consistently links the events of Jesus&#8217; ministry and message with old promises (Rom 1:1-4; Heb 1:1-2). The traditional translation of this word, &#8220;mystery,&#8221; is misleading to the modern English reader because this English word suggests a secret which people have tried to uncover but which they have failed to understand (L&amp;N 28.77).</p>
<A NAME="834"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1152><b>sn</b> <i>The kingdom of God</i> is a major theme of Jesus. It is a realm in which Jesus rules and to which those who trust him belong. See Luke 6:20; 11:20; 17:20-21.</p>
<A NAME="835"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1153><b>sn</b> A quotation from Isa 6:9. Thus parables both conceal or reveal depending on whether one is open to hearing what they teach.</p>
<A NAME="836"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1154><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;is,&#8221; but in this context it is clearly giving an explanation of the parable.</p>
<A NAME="837"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1155><b>sn</b> Interestingly, the synoptic parallels each use a different word for <i>the devil</i> here: Matt 13:19 has &#8220;the evil one,&#8221; while Mark 4:15 has &#8220;Satan.&#8221; This illustrates the fluidity of the gospel tradition in often using synonyms at the same point of the parallel tradition.</p>
<A NAME="838"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1156><b>sn</b> The <i>word</i> of Jesus has the potential to save if it germinates in a person&#8217;s heart, something the devil is very much against.</p>
<A NAME="839"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1157><b>tn</b> The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pisteusante&quot;</font>) has been translated as a finite verb here. It may be regarded as an adverbial participle of attendant circumstance. From a logical standpoint the negative must govern both the participle and the finite verb.</p>
<A NAME="840"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1158><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> (<font face="Greektl">de</font>) has not been translated.</p>
<A NAME="841"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1159><b>sn</b> This time of temporary faith represented by the description <i>believe for a while</i> is presented rather tragically in the passage. The seed does not get a chance to do all it can.</p>

<A NAME="843"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1161><b>tn</b> Traditionally, &#8220;temptation.&#8221; Such a translation puts the emphasis on temptation to sin rather than testing of faith, which is what the context seems to indicate.</p>
<A NAME="844"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1162><b>sn</b> <i>Fall away. </i>On the idea of falling away and the warnings against it, see 2 Tim 3:1; Heb 3:12; Jer 3:14; Dan 9:9.</p>

<A NAME="847"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1165><b>sn</b> That is, their concern for spiritual things is crowded out by material things.</p>
<A NAME="848"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1166><b>sn</b> On warnings about the dangers of excessive material attachments, described here as <i>the worries and riches and pleasures of life</i>, see Luke 12:12-21; 16:19-31.</p>
<A NAME="849"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=1167><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#949;&#955;&#949;&#963;&#966;&#959;&#961;&#941;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">telesforew</font>) means &#8220;to produce mature or ripe fruit&#8221; (L&amp;N 23.203). Once again the seed does not reach its goal.</p>
<A NAME="850"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=1168><b>tn</b> The aorist participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#954;&#959;&#973;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">akousante&quot;</font>) has been taken temporally, reflecting action antecedent (prior to) that of the main verb.</p>
<A NAME="851"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=1169><b>sn</b> There is a tenacity that is a part of spiritual fruitfulness.</p>
<A NAME="852"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=1170><b>sn</b><i> </i>In an ancient context, the qualifier <i>good</i> described the ethical person who possessed integrity. Here it is integrity concerning God&#8217;s revelation through Jesus.</p>
<A NAME="853"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=1171><b>sn</b> Given the pressures noted in the previous soils, bearing fruit takes time (<i>steadfast endurance</i>), just as it does for the farmer. See Jas 1:2-4.</p>
<A NAME="854"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=1172><b>tn</b> The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7941;&#968;&#945;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">{aya&quot;</font>) has been translated as a finite verb due to requirements of contemporary English style.</p>
<A NAME="855"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=1173><b>sn</b> This is probably an ancient oil burning <i>lamp</i> or perhaps a candlestick. Jesus is comparing revelation to light, particularly the revelation of his ministry; see 1:78-79.</p>

<A NAME="857"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=1175><b>sn</b> <i>Nothing is hidden. </i>Light also exposes, and Jesus was suggesting that his teaching likewise revealed where people </p><p class="footnote">are and where they will be.

<A NAME="861"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=1179><b>sn</b> The phrase <i>what he thinks he has </i>is important, because it is not what a person thinks he has that is important but whether he actually has something or not. Jesus describes the person who does not heed his word as having nothing. The person who has nothing loses even that which he thought was something but was not. In other words, he has absolutely nothing at all. Jesus&#8217; teaching must be taken seriously.</p>
<A NAME="862"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=1180><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;his&#8221;; the referent (Jesus) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="863"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=1181><b>sn</b> The issue of whether Jesus had <i>brothers </i>(siblings) has had a long history in the church. Epiphanius, in the 4th century, argued that Mary was a perpetual virgin and had no offspring other than Jesus. Others argued that these brothers were really cousins. Nothing in the text suggests any of this. See also John 7:3.</p>

<A NAME="867"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=1185><b>tn</b> There is some discussion about the grammar of this verse in Greek. If &#8220;these&#8221; is the subject, then it reads, &#8220;These are my mother and brothers, those who.&#8221; If &#8220;these&#8221; is a nominative absolute, which is slightly more likely, then the verse more literally reads, &#8220;So my mother and brothers, they are those who.&#8221; The sense in either case is the same.</p>

The equivalent Hebrew expression in the OT had two basic meanings: (1) When one person was unjustly bothering another, the injured party could say &#8220;What to me and to you?&#8221; meaning, &#8220;What have I done to you that you should do this to me?&#8221; (Judg 11:12; 2 Chr 35:21; 1 Kgs 17:18). (2) When someone was asked to get involved in a matter he felt was no business of his own, he could say to the one asking him, &#8220;What to me and to you?&#8221; meaning, &#8220;That is your business, how am I involved?&#8221; (2 Kgs 3:13; Hos 14:8). These nuances were apparently expanded in Greek, but the basic notions of defensive hostility (option 1) and indifference or disengagement (option 2) are still present. BDAG suggests the following as glosses for this expression: <i>What have I to do with you? What have we in common? Leave me alone! Never mind! </i>Hostility between Jesus and the demons is certainly to be understood in this context, hence the translation: &#8220;Leave me alone&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
