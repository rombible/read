<A NAME="1482"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">82</span><note=2170><b>sn</b> <i>None of those individuals who were invited. </i>This is both the point and the warning. To be a part of the original invitation does not mean one automatically has access to blessing. One must respond when the summons comes in order to participate. The summons came in the person of Jesus and his proclamation of the kingdom. The statement here refers to the fact that many in Israel will not be blessed with participation, for they have ignored the summons when it came.</p>
