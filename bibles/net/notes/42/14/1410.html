<A NAME="1410"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2098><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Jesus, answering, said.&#8221; This is redundant in contemporary English. In addition, since the context does not describe a previous question to Jesus (although one may well be implied), the phrase has been translated here as &#8220;Jesus asked.&#8221;</p>
