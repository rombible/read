<A NAME="1437"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=2125><b>tn</b> The meaning of the two terms for meals here, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ariston</font>) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#949;&#8150;&#960;&#957;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">deipnon</font>), essentially overlap (L&amp;N 23.22). Translators usually try to find two terms for a meal to use as equivalents (e.g., lunch and dinner, dinner and supper, etc.). In this translation &#8220;dinner&#8221; and &#8220;banquet&#8221; have been used, since the expected presence of rich neighbors later in the verse suggests a rather more elaborate occasion than an ordinary meal.</p>
