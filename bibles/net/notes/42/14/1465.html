<A NAME="1465"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=2153><b>sn</b> <i>I just got married, and I cannot come. </i>There is no request to be excused here; just a refusal. Why this disqualifies attendance is not clear. The OT freed a newly married man from certain responsibilities such as serving in the army (Deut 20:7; 24:5), but that would hardly apply to a banquet. The invitation is not respected in any of the three cases.</p>
