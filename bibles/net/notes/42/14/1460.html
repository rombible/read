<A NAME="1460"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=2148><b>sn</b> The expression <i>Please excuse me</i> is probably a polite way of refusing, given the dynamics of the situation, although it is important to note that an initial acceptance had probably been indicated and it was now a bit late for a refusal. The semantic equivalent of the phrase may well be &#8220;please accept my apologies.&#8221;</p>
