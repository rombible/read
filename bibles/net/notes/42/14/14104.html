<A NAME="14104"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">104</span><note=2192><b>sn</b> This image is slightly different from the former one about the tower (vv. 28-30). The first part of the illustration (<i>sit down first and determine</i>) deals with preparation. The second part of the illustration (<i>ask for terms of peace</i>) has to do with recognizing who is stronger. This could well suggest thinking about what refusing the &#8220;stronger one&#8221; (God) might mean, and thus constitutes a warning. Achieving peace with God, the more powerful king, is the point of the illustration.</p>
