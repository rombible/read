Acc. to Mishnah, Shekalim 6, 5 there were in the temple 13 such receptacles in the form of trumpets. But even in these passages the general sense of &#8216;treasury&#8217; is prob., for the contributions would go [into] the treasury via the receptacles.&#8221; Based upon the extra-biblical evidence (see <b>sn</b> following), however, the translation opts to refer to the actual receptacles and not the treasury itself.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The <i>offering box</i> probably refers to the receptacles in the temple forecourt by the Court of Women used to collect freewill offerings. These are mentioned by Josephus, <i>J. W.</i> 5.5.2 (5.200), 6.5.2 (6.282); <i>Ant.</i> 19.6.1 (19.294); and in 1 Macc 14:49 and 2 Macc 3:6, 24, 28, 40 (see also Mark 12:41; John 8:20).</p>

<A NAME="2118"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2889><b>sn</b> Both references to <i>these things</i> are plural, so more than the temple&#8217;s destruction is in view. The question may presuppose that such a catastrophe signals the end.</p>

<A NAME="2123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2894><b>tn</b> Social and political chaos also precedes the end. This term refers to revolutions (L&amp;N 39.34).</p>
<A NAME="2124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2895><b>tn</b> This is not the usual term for fear, but refers to a deep sense of terror and emotional distress (Luke 24:37; BDAG 895 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#964;&#959;&#941;&#969;</font>).</p>
<A NAME="2125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2896><b>sn</b> <i>The end will not come at once. </i>This remark about timing not only indicates that there will be events before the end, but that some time will also pass before it comes. </p>
<A NAME="2126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2897><b>tn</b> For the translation &#8220;rise up in arms&#8221; see L&amp;N 55.2.</p>
<A NAME="2127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2898><b>sn</b> See Isa 5:13-14; 13:6-16; Hag 2:6-7; Zech 14:4.</p>

It could refer to an object, event, or condition that causes fear, but in the context it is linked with great signs from heaven, so the translation &#8220;sights&#8221; was preferred.</p>
<A NAME="2129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2900><b>sn</b> See Jer 4:13-22; 14:12; 21:6-7.</p>
<A NAME="2130"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2901><b>sn</b> <i>But before all this. </i>Another note of timing is present, this one especially important in understanding the sequence in the discourse.

<A NAME="2133"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=2904><b>tn</b> Because of the length and complexity of the Greek sentence, a new sentence was started here in the translation.</p>

<A NAME="2136"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=2907><b>tn</b> This term could refer to rehearsing a speech or a dance. On its syntax, see BDF §392.2.</p>
<A NAME="2137"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=2908><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;a mouth.&#8221; It is a metonymy and refers to the reply the Lord will give to them.</p>
<A NAME="2138"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=2909><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;and wisdom.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2139"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=2910><b>sn</b> To confess Christ might well mean rejection by one&#8217;s own family, <i>even by parents</i>.</p>

<A NAME="2141"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=2912><b>sn</b> See Luke 6:22, 27; 1 Cor 1:25-31.</p>

<A NAME="2143"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=2914><b>sn</b> Given v. 16, the expression <i>not a hair of your head will perish</i> must be taken figuratively and refer to living ultimately in the presence of God.</p>
<A NAME="2144"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=2915><b>sn</b> <i>By your endurance</i> is a call to remain faithful, because trusting in Jesus is the means to life.</p>
<A NAME="2145"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=2916><b>tc</b> Some important Greek witnesses plus the majority of <sc>mss (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> D L W <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1</sup><i> </i><font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>) read the aorist imperative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#964;&#8053;&#963;&#945;&#963;&#952;&#949;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kthsasqe</font>) here, though some <sc>mss (A B <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13</sup> 33 <i>pc </i>lat sa) read the future indicative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#964;&#8053;&#963;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#949;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kthsesqe</font>). A decision is difficult because the evidence is so evenly balanced, but the aorist imperative is the harder reading and better explains the rise of the other. J. A. Fitzmyer assesses the translation options this way: &#8220;In English one has to use something similar [i.e., a future indicative], even if one follows the [aorist imperative]&#8221; (<i>Luke</i> [AB], 2:1341); in the same vein, although this translation follows the aorist imperative, because of English requirements it has been translated as though it were a future indicative.</p>
<A NAME="2146"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=2917><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;your souls,&#8221; but <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#968;&#965;&#967;&#8053;</font> (<font face="Greektl">yuch</font>) is frequently used of one&#8217;s physical life. In light of v. 16 that does not seem to be the case here. The entire phrase could be taken as an idiom meaning &#8220;you will save yourselves&#8221; (L&amp;N 21.20), or (as in v. 18) this could refer to living ultimately in the presence of God.</p>

<A NAME="2148"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=2919><b>sn</b> See Luke 19:41-44. This passage refers to the events associated with the fall of Jerusalem, when the city is <i>surrounded by armies</i>.</p>
<A NAME="2149"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=2920><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;her,&#8221; referring to the city of Jerusalem (the name &#8220;Jerusalem&#8221; in Greek is a feminine noun).</p>
<A NAME="2150"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=2921><b>sn</b> The phrase <i>its desolation</i> is a reference to the fall of the city, which is the only antecedent present in Luke&#8217;s account. The parallels to this in Matt 24:15 and Mark 13:14 refer to the temple&#8217;s desolation, though Matthew&#8217;s allusion is clearer. They focus on the parallel events of the end, not on the short term realization in <sc>a.d. 70. The entire passage has a prophetic &#8220;two events in one&#8221; typology, where the near term destruction (<sc>a.d. 70) is like the end. So the evangelists could choose to focus on the near time realization (Luke) or on its long term fulfillment, which mirrors it (Matthew, Mark). </p>
<A NAME="2151"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=2922><b>sn</b> Fleeing<i> to the mountains </i>is a key OT image: Gen 19:17; Judg 6:2; Isa 15:5; Jer 16:16; Zech 14:5.</p>

<A NAME="2166"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=2937><b>sn</b> An allusion to Isa 34:4. The heavens were seen as the abode of heavenly forces, so their shaking indicates distress in the spiritual realm. Although some take <i>the powers</i> as a reference to bodies in the heavens (like stars and planets, &#8220;the heavenly bodies,&#8221; NIV) this is not as likely.</p>

<A NAME="2174"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">74</span><note=2945><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#953;&#957;&#8061;&#963;&#954;&#949;&#964;&#949;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ginwskete</font>, &#8220;know&#8221;) can be parsed as either present indicative or present imperative. In this context the imperative fits better, since the movement is from analogy (trees and seasons) to the future (the signs of the coming of the kingdom) and since the emphasis is on preparation for this event.</p>
<A NAME="2175"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">75</span><note=2946><b>sn</b> The<i> kingdom of God </i>refers here to the kingdom in all its power. See Luke 17:20-37.</p>

<A NAME="2177"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">77</span><note=2948><b>sn</b> This is one of the hardest verses in the gospels to interpret. Various views exist for what <i>generation</i> means. (1) Some take it as meaning &#8220;race&#8221; and thus as an assurance that the Jewish race (nation) will not pass away. But it is very questionable that the Greek term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#949;&#957;&#949;&#940;</font> (<font face="Greektl">genea</font>) can have this meaning. Two other options are possible. (2) <i>Generation</i> might mean &#8220;this type of generation&#8221; and refer to the generation of wicked humanity. Then the point is that humanity will not perish, because God will redeem it. Or (3) <i>generation </i>may refer to &#8220;the generation that sees the signs of the end&#8221; (vv. 25-26), who will also see the end itself. In other words, once the movement to the return of Christ starts, all the events connected with it happen very quickly, in rapid succession.</p>
<A NAME="2178"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">78</span><note=2949><b>sn</b> The<i> words</i> that Jesus predicts here <i>will never pass away</i>. They are more stable and lasting than creation itself. For this kind of image, see Isa 40:8; 55:10-11.</p>

<A NAME="2180"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">80</span><note=2951><b>sn</b> Or like a thief, see Luke 12:39-40. The metaphor of a <i>trap </i>is a vivid one. Most modern English translations traditionally place the words &#8220;like a trap&#8221; at the end of v. 34, completing the metaphor. In the Greek text (and in the NRSV and REB) the words &#8220;like a trap&#8221; are placed at the beginning of v. 35. This does not affect the meaning.</p>
<A NAME="2181"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">81</span><note=2952><b>tn</b> There is debate in the textual tradition about the position of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#940;&#961;</font> (<font face="Greektl">gar</font>) and whether v. 35 looks back to v. 34 or is independent. The textual evidence does slightly favor placing <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#940;&#961;</font> after the verb and thus linking it back to v. 34. The other reading looks like Isa 24:17. However, the construction is harsh and the translation prefers for stylistic reasons to start a new English sentence here.</p>
