<A NAME="32"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=417><b>sn</b> The rule of <i>Pontius Pilate</i> is also described by Josephus, <i>J. W.</i> 2.9.2-4 (2.169-177) and <i>Ant.</i> 18.3.1 (18.55-59).</p>
<A NAME="33"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=418><b>sn</b> <i>Herod</i> refers here to Herod Antipas, son of Herod the Great. He ruled from 4 <sc>b.c.-<sc>a.d. 39, sharing the rule of his father&#8217;s realm with his two brothers. One brother, Archelaus (Matt 2:22) was banished in <sc>a.d. 6 and died in <sc>a.d. 18; the other brother, Herod Philip (mentioned next) died in <sc>a.d. 34.</p>
<A NAME="34"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=419><b>sn</b> A <i>tetrarch</i> was a ruler with rank and authority lower than a king, who ruled only with the approval of the Roman authorities. This was roughly equivalent to being governor of a region. Several times in the NT, Herod tetrarch of Galilee is called a king (Matt 14:9, Mark 6:14-29), reflecting popular usage.</p>
<A NAME="35"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=420><b>sn</b> <i>Philip</i> refers to Herod Philip, son of Herod the Great and brother of Herod Antipas. Philip ruled as tetrarch of Iturea and Trachonitis from 4 <sc>b.c.-<sc>a.d. 34.</p>

<A NAME="37"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=422><b>sn</b> Use of the singular <i>high priesthood</i> to mention two figures is unusual but accurate, since Annas was the key priest from <sc>a.d. 6-15 and then his relatives were chosen for many of the next several years. After two brief tenures by others, his son-in-law Caiaphas came to power and stayed there until <sc>a.d. 36.</p>

Due to the length and complexity of the Greek sentence, a new sentence was started here in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=426><b>tn</b> &#8220;River&#8221; is not in the Greek text but is supplied for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=427><b>sn</b> <i>A baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins</i> was a call for preparation for the arrival of the Lord&#8217;s salvation. To participate in this baptism was a recognition of the need for God&#8217;s forgiveness with a sense that one needed to live differently as a response to it (Luke 3:10-14).</p>
<A NAME="313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=428><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;A voice.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=429><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;desert.&#8221; The syntactic position of the phrase &#8220;in the wilderness&#8221; is unclear in both Luke and the LXX. The MT favors taking it with &#8220;Prepare a way,&#8221; while the LXX takes it with &#8220;a voice shouting.&#8221; If the former, the meaning would be that such preparation should be done &#8220;in the wilderness.&#8221; If the latter, the meaning would be that the place from where John&#8217;s ministry went forth was &#8220;in the wilderness.&#8221; There are Jewish materials that support both renderings: 1QS 8:14 and 9.19-20 support the MT while certain rabbinic texts favor the LXX (see D. L. Bock, <i>Luke</i> [BECNT], 1:290-91). While it is not absolutely necessary that a call in the wilderness led to a response in the wilderness, it is not unlikely that such would be the case. Thus, in the final analysis, the net effect between the two choices may be minimal. In any case, a majority of commentators and translations take &#8220;in the wilderness&#8221; with &#8220;The voice of one shouting&#8221; (D. L. Bock; R. H. Stein, <i>Luke</i> [NAC], 129; I. H. Marshall, <i>Luke</i> [NIGTC], 136; NIV, NRSV, NKJV, NLT, NASB, REB).</p>
<A NAME="315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=430><b>tn</b> This call to &#8220;make paths straight&#8221; in this context is probably an allusion to preparation through repentance as the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#959;&#953;&#941;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">poiew</font>) reappears in vv. 8, 10, 11, 12, 14.</p>
<A NAME="316"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=431><b>sn</b> The figurative language of this verse speaks of the whole creation preparing for the arrival of a major figure, so all obstacles to his approach are removed.</p>
<A NAME="317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=432><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;all flesh.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=433><b>sn</b> A quotation from Isa 40:3-5. Though all the synoptic gospels use this citation from Isaiah, only Luke cites the material of vv. 5-6. His goal may well be to get to the declaration of v. 6, where all humanity (i.e., all nations) see God&#8217;s salvation (see also Luke 24:47).</p>
<A NAME="319"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=434><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (John) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="320"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=435><b>sn</b> <i>The crowds. </i>It is interesting to trace references to &#8220;the crowd&#8221; in Luke. It is sometimes noted favorably, other times less so. The singular appears 25 times in Luke while the plural occurs 16 times. Matt 3:7 singles out the Sadducees and Pharisees here.</p>
<A NAME="321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=436><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;snakes.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=437><b>sn</b> The rebuke &#8220;<i>Who warned you to flee&#8230;?</i>&#8221; compares the crowd to snakes who flee their desert holes when the heat of a fire drives them out.</p>
<A NAME="323"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=438><b>tn</b> The verb here is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#959;&#953;&#941;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">poiew</font>; see v. 4).</p>
<A NAME="324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=439><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;fruits.&#8221; The plural Greek term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#961;&#960;&#959;&#973;&#962;</font> has been translated with the collective singular &#8220;fruit&#8221; (so NIV; cf. Matt 3:8 where the singular <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#961;&#960;&#972;&#962;</font> is found). Some other translations render the plural <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#961;&#960;&#959;&#973;&#962;</font> as &#8220;fruits&#8221; (e.g., NRSV, NASB, NAB, NKJV).</p>
<A NAME="325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=440><b>tn</b> In other words, &#8220;do not even begin to think this.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=441><b>sn</b> <i>We have Abraham as our father. </i>John&#8217;s warning to the crowds really assumes two things: (1) A number of John&#8217;s listeners apparently believed that simply by their physical descent from Abraham, they were certain heirs of the promises made to the patriarch, and (2) God would never judge his covenant people lest he inadvertently place the fulfillment of his promises in jeopardy. In light of this, John tells these people two things: (1) they need to repent and produce fruit in keeping with repentance, for only that saves from the coming wrath, and (2) God will raise up &#8220;children for Abraham from these stones&#8221; if he wants to. Their disobedience will not threaten the realization of God&#8217;s sovereign purposes.</p>
<A NAME="327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=442><b>sn</b><i> </i>The point of the statement <i>God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham</i> is that ancestry or association with a tradition tied to the great founder of the Jewish nation is not an automatic source of salvation.</p>
<A NAME="328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=443><b>sn</b> <i>Even now the ax is laid at the root of the trees.</i> The imagery of an &#8220;ax already laid at the root of the trees&#8221; is vivid, connoting sudden and catastrophic judgment for the unrepentant and unfruitful. The image of &#8220;fire&#8221; serves to further heighten the intensity of the judgment referred to. It is John&#8217;s way of summoning all people to return to God with all their heart and avoid his unquenchable wrath soon to be poured out. John&#8217;s language and imagery is probably ultimately drawn from the OT where Israel is referred to as a fruitless vine (Hos 10:1-2; Jer 2:21-22) and the image of an &#8220;ax&#8221; is used to indicate God&#8217;s judgment (Ps 74:5-6; Jer 46:22).</p>
<A NAME="329"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=444><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;is&#8221;; the present tense (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954;&#954;&#972;&#960;&#964;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;</font>, <font face="Greektl">ekkoptetai</font>) has futuristic force here.</p>

<A NAME="331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=446><b>tn</b> Though this verb is imperfect, in this context it does not mean repeated, ongoing questions, but simply a presentation in vivid style as the following verbs in the other examples are aorist.</p>

<A NAME="334"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=449><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;shirt&#8221; (a long garment worn under the cloak next to the skin). The name for this garment (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#967;&#953;&#964;&#8061;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">citwn</font>) presents some difficulty in translation. Most modern readers would not understand what a &#8216;tunic&#8217; was any more than they would be familiar with a &#8216;<i>chiton</i>.&#8217; On the other hand, attempts to find a modern equivalent are also a problem: &#8220;Shirt&#8221; conveys the idea of a much shorter garment that covers only the upper body, and &#8220;undergarment&#8221; (given the styles of modern underwear) is more misleading still. &#8220;Tunic&#8221; was therefore employed, but with a note to explain its nature.</p>
<A NAME="335"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=450><b>sn</b> The <i>tax collectors</i> would bid to collect taxes for the Roman government and then add a surcharge, which they kept. Since tax collectors worked for Rome, they were viewed as traitors to their own people and were not well liked. Yet even they were moved by John&#8217;s call.</p>
<A NAME="336"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=451><b>tn</b> In the Greek text <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#951;&#948;&#8050;&#957; &#960;&#955;&#941;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">mhden pleon</font>, &#8220;no more&#8221;) is in an emphatic position.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> By telling the tax collectors to collect <i>no more than&#8230;required </i>John was calling for honesty and integrity in a business that was known for greed and dishonesty.</p>

Soldiers are to perform their tasks faithfully. A changed person is to carry out his tasks in life faithfully and without grumbling. </p>
<A NAME="341"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=456><b>tn</b> The term translated &#8220;accusation&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#965;&#954;&#959;&#966;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#8053;&#963;&#951;&#964;&#949;</font>, <font face="Greektl">sukofanthshte</font>) refers to a procedure by which someone could bring charges against an individual and be paid a part of the fine imposed by the court. Soldiers could do this to supplement their pay, and would thus be tempted to make false accusations.</p>
<A NAME="342"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=457><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;with expectation.&#8221; The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#948;&#959;&#954;&#8182;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">prosdokwnto&quot;</font>) is taken temporally.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>The people were filled with anticipation </i>because they were hoping God would send someone to deliver them.</p>

Although two of the <sc>mss in support are early and important, it is an obviously motivated reading to add clarification, probably representing a copyist&#8217;s attempt to harmonize Luke&#8217;s version with Matt 3:11.</p>
<A NAME="348"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=463><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;of whom I am not worthy.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The humility of John is evident in the statement <i>I am not worthy</i>. This was considered one of the least worthy tasks of a slave, and John did not consider himself worthy to do even that for the one to come, despite the fact he himself was a prophet!</p>
<A NAME="349"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=464><b>tn</b> The term refers to the leather strap or thong used to bind a sandal. This is often viewed as a collective singular and translated as a plural, &#8220;the straps of his sandals,&#8221; but it may be more emphatic to retain the singular here.</p>
<A NAME="350"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=465><b>sn</b> <i>With the Holy Spirit and fire</i>. There are differing interpretations for this phrase regarding the number of baptisms and their nature. (1) Some see one baptism here, and this can be divided further into two options. (a) The baptism of <i>the Holy Spirit and fire </i>could refer to the cleansing, purifying work of the Spirit in the individual believer through salvation and sanctification, or (b) it could refer to two different results of Christ&#8217;s ministry: Some accept Christ and are baptized with the Holy Spirit, but some reject him and receive judgment. (2) Other interpreters see two baptisms here: The baptism of the <i>Holy Spirit </i>refers to the salvation Jesus brings at his first advent, in which believers receive the Holy Spirit, and the baptism of <i>fire </i>refers to the judgment Jesus will bring upon the world at his second coming. One must take into account both the image of fire and whether individual or corporate baptism is in view. A decision is not easy on either issue. The image of fire is used to refer to both eternal judgment (e.g., Matt 25:41) and the power of the Lord&#8217;s presence to purge and cleanse his people (e.g., Isa 4:4-5). The pouring out of the Spirit at Pentecost, a fulfillment of this prophecy no matter which interpretation is taken, had both individual and corporate dimensions. It is possible that since <i>Holy Spirit and fire </i>are governed by a single preposition in Greek, the one-baptism view may be more likely, but this is not certain. Simply put, there is no consensus view in scholarship at this time on the best interpretation of this passage.</p>

God is marking out Jesus as his chosen one (the meaning of &#8220;[in you I take] great delight&#8221;), but it may well be that this was a private experience that only Jesus and John saw and heard (cf. John 1:32-33).</p>

<A NAME="369"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">69</span><note=484><b>sn</b> The parenthetical remark <i>as was supposed</i> makes it clear that Joseph was not the biological father of Jesus. But a question still remains whose genealogy this is. Mary is nowhere mentioned, so this may simply refer to the line of Joseph, who would have functioned as Jesus&#8217; legal father, much like stepchildren can have when they are adopted by a second parent.</p>

Both genealogies go through David. </p>
<A NAME="371"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=486><b>sn</b> On <i>Zerubbabel </i>see Ezra 2:2.</p>

<A NAME="373"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">73</span><note=488><b>sn</b> <i>Shealtiel, the son of Neri. </i>1 Chr 3:17 identifies Jeconiah as the father of Shealtiel. The judgment on Jeconiah&#8217;s line (Jer 22:30) may be reflected here.</p>
<A NAME="374"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">74</span><note=489><b>sn</b> The use of <i>Nathan</i> here as the son of David is different than Matthew, where Solomon is named. Nathan was David&#8217;s third son. It is not entirely clear what causes the difference. Some argue Nathan stresses a prophetic connection, but it is not clear how (through confusion with the prophet Nathan?). Others note the absence of a reference to Jeconiah later, so that here there is a difference to show the canceling out of this line. The differences appear to mean that Matthew&#8217;s line is a &#8220;royal and physical&#8221; line, while Luke has a &#8220;royal and legal&#8221; line.</p>
<A NAME="375"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">75</span><note=490><b>sn</b> The mention of <i>David</i> begins a series of agreements with Matthew&#8217;s line. The OT background is 1 Chr 2:1-15 and Ruth 4:18-22.</p>

<A NAME="377"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">77</span><note=492><b>tc</b> The number and order of the first few names in this verse varies greatly in the <sc>mss. The variants which are most likely to be original based upon external evidence are Amminadab, Aram (A D 33 565 [1424] <i>pm</i> lat); Amminadab, Aram, Joram (K <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#916;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 700 2542 <i>pm</i>); Adam, Admin, Arni (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>4vid</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* 1241 <i>pc</i> sa); and Amminadab, Admin, Arni (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>2</sup> L X [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#915;</font>] <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13</sup> <i>pc</i>). Deciding between these variants is quite difficult. The reading &#8220;Amminadab, Aram&#8221; is the strongest externally since it is represented by Alexandrian, Western, and Byzantine witnesses, although it is significantly weaker internally because it disrupts the artistic balance of the number of generations and their groups that three names would preserve (see <i>TCGNT</i> 113, fn. 1 for discussion). In this case, the subtle intrinsic arguments that would most likely be overlooked by scribes argues for the reading &#8220;Amminadab, Admin, Arni,&#8221; although a decision is quite difficult because of the lack of strong external support.</p>
<A NAME="378"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">78</span><note=493><b>sn</b> The list now picks up names from Gen 11:10-26; 5:1-32; 1 Chr 1:1-26, especially 1:24-26.</p>

But the omission may be a motivated reading: This name is not found in the editions of the Hebrew OT, though it is in the LXX, at Gen 11:12 and 10:24.

<A NAME="382"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">82</span><note=497><b>sn</b> The reference to <i>the son of God</i> here is not to a divine being, but to one directly formed by the hand of God.
