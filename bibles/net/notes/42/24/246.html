<A NAME="246"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=3287><b>tc</b> The translation follows the much better attested longer reading here, &#8220;body of the Lord Jesus&#8221; (found in {<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>75</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A B C L W <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13</sup> 33 565 700 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>}), rather than simply &#8220;the body&#8221; (found in D it) or &#8220;the body of Jesus&#8221; (found in 579 1241 <i>pc</i>). Further, although this is the only time that &#8220;Lord Jesus&#8221; occurs in Luke, it seems to be Luke&#8217;s normal designation for the Lord <i>after</i> his resurrection (note the many references to Christ in this manner in Acts, e.g., 1:21; 4:33; 7:59; 8:16; 11:17; 15:11; 16:31; 19:5; 20:21; 28:31). Although such a longer reading as this would normally be suspect, in this case some scribes, accustomed to Luke&#8217;s more abbreviated style, did not take the resurrection into account.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> What they found was not what they expected &#8211; an empty tomb.</p>
