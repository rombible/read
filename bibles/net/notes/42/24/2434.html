<A NAME="2434"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=3315><b>tc</b> Some Western <sc>mss (D it) lack <b>24:12.</b> The verse has been called a Western noninterpolation, meaning that it reflects a shorter authentic reading in D and other Western witnesses. Many regard all such shorter readings as original (the verse is omitted in the RSV), but the ms evidence for omission is far too slight for the verse to be rejected as secondary. It is included in <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>75</sup> and the rest of the ms tradition.</p>
