<A NAME="24116"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">116</span><note=3397><b>tn</b> Three Greek infinitives are the key to this summary: (1) to suffer, (2) to rise, and (3) to be preached. The Christ (Messiah) would be slain, would be raised, and a message about repentance would go out into all the world as a result. All of this was recorded in the scripture. The remark shows the continuity between Jesus&#8217; ministry, the scripture, and what disciples would be doing as they declared the Lord risen.</p>
