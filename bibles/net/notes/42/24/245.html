<A NAME="245"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=3286><b>sn</b> Luke tells the story of the empty tomb with little drama. He simply notes that when they arrived <i>the stone had been rolled away</i> in a position where the tomb could be entered. This large stone was often placed in a channel so that it could be easily moved by rolling it aside. The other possibility is that it was merely placed over the opening in a position from which it had now been moved.</p>
