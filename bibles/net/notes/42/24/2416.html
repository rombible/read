<A NAME="2416"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=3297><b>tc</b> The phrase &#8220;He is not here, but has been raised&#8221; is omitted by a few <sc>mss (D it), but it has wide ms support and differs slightly from the similar statement in Matt 28:6 and Mark 16:6. Although NA<sup>27</sup> places the phrase at the beginning of v. 6, as do most modern English translations, it is omitted from the RSV and placed at the end of v. 5 in the NRSV.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> The verb here is passive (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7968;&#947;&#941;&#961;&#952;&#951;</font>, <font face="Greektl">hgerqh</font>). This &#8220;divine passive&#8221; (see <i>ExSyn</i> 437-38) points to the fact that Jesus was raised by God, and such activity by God is a consistent Lukan theological emphasis: Luke 20:37; 24:34; Acts 3:15; 4:10; 5:30; 10:40; 13:30, 37. A passive construction is also used to refer to Jesus&#8217; exaltation: Luke 24:51; Acts 1:11, 22. </p>
