<A NAME="24132"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">132</span><note=3413><b>tc</b> The reference to the ascension (&#8220;and was taken up into heaven&#8221;) is lacking in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* D it sy<sup>s</sup>, but it is found in <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>75</sup> and the rest of the ms tradition. The authenticity of the statement here seems to be presupposed in Acts 1:2, for otherwise it is difficult to account for Luke&#8217;s reference to the ascension there.

The text can be read in this way because the temporal marker in v. 50 is vague. </p>
