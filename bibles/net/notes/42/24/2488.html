<A NAME="2488"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">88</span><note=3369><b>tc</b> &#8225; Most <sc>mss have the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#7969;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">en Jhmin</font>, &#8220;within us&#8221;) after <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8016;&#967;&#8054; &#7969; &#954;&#945;&#961;&#948;&#943;&#945; &#7969;&#956;&#8182;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#951; &#7974;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ouci Jh kardia Jhmwn kaiomenh hn</font>, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t our hearts burn&#8221;). The phrase &#8220;within us&#8221; is lacking in some early <sc>mss (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>75</sup> B D c e sy<sup>s,c</sup>). These early witnesses could have overlooked the words, since there are several occurrences of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</font> in the context. But it seems likely that other scribes wanted to clarify the abrupt expression &#8220;Didn&#8217;t our hearts burn,&#8221; even as the translation has done here. NA<sup>27</sup> includes the words in brackets, indicating doubts as to their authenticity.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Even though it is most likely not original (see <b>tc</b> note above), the phrase <i>within us </i>has been included in the translation for clarity.</p>
