<A NAME="2426"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=3307><b>sn</b> <i>Mary Magdalene</i> is always noted first in the appearance lists in the gospels. It is unusual that the first appearance would involve women as in this culture their role as witnesses would not be well accepted. It is a sign of the veracity of the account, because if an ancient were to create such a story he would never have it start with women.</p>
