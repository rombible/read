<A NAME="24138"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">138</span><note=3419><b>tc</b> The majority of Greek <sc>mss, some of which are important witnesses (A B C<sup>2</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13</sup> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat), add &#8220;Amen&#8221; to note the Gospel&#8217;s end. Such a conclusion is routinely added by scribes to NT books because a few of these books originally had such an ending (cf. Rom 16:27; Gal 6:18; Jude 25). A majority of Greek witnesses have the concluding <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957; </font>in every NT book except Acts, James, and 3 John (and even in these books, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font> is found in some witnesses). It is thus a predictable variant. Further, since significant witnesses lack the word (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>75</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> C* D L W 1 33 <i>pc </i>it co ), it is evidently not original.</p>
