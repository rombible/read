<A NAME="1532"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2230><b>sn</b> The whole of heaven is said to rejoice. <i>Joy in the presence of God&#8217;s angels</i> is a way of referring to God&#8217;s joy as well without having to name him explicitly. Contemporary Judaism tended to refer to God indirectly where possible out of reverence or respect for the divine name.</p>
