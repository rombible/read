<A NAME="1599"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">99</span><note=2297><b>sn</b> The theme <i>he was lost and is found</i> is repeated from v. 24. The conclusion is open-ended. The reader is left to ponder with the older son (who pictures the scribes and Pharisees) what the response will be. The parable does not reveal the ultimate response of the older brother. Jesus argued that sinners should be pursued and received back warmly when they returned.</p>
