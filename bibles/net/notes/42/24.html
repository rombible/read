<A NAME="245"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=3286><b>sn</b> Luke tells the story of the empty tomb with little drama. He simply notes that when they arrived <i>the stone had been rolled away</i> in a position where the tomb could be entered. This large stone was often placed in a channel so that it could be easily moved by rolling it aside. The other possibility is that it was merely placed over the opening in a position from which it had now been moved.</p>
<A NAME="246"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=3287><b>tc</b> The translation follows the much better attested longer reading here, &#8220;body of the Lord Jesus&#8221; (found in {<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>75</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A B C L W <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13</sup> 33 565 700 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>}), rather than simply &#8220;the body&#8221; (found in D it) or &#8220;the body of Jesus&#8221; (found in 579 1241 <i>pc</i>). Further, although this is the only time that &#8220;Lord Jesus&#8221; occurs in Luke, it seems to be Luke&#8217;s normal designation for the Lord <i>after</i> his resurrection (note the many references to Christ in this manner in Acts, e.g., 1:21; 4:33; 7:59; 8:16; 11:17; 15:11; 16:31; 19:5; 20:21; 28:31). Although such a longer reading as this would normally be suspect, in this case some scribes, accustomed to Luke&#8217;s more abbreviated style, did not take the resurrection into account.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> What they found was not what they expected &#8211; an empty tomb.</p>

Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has not been translated because of differences between Greek and English style.</p>
<A NAME="248"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=3289><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;bewildered.&#8221; The term refers to a high state of confusion and anxiety.</p>

<A NAME="2410"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=3291><b>sn</b> The brilliantly shining clothing (<i>dazzling attire</i>) points to the fact that these are angels (see 24:23).</p>

<A NAME="2414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=3295><b>sn</b> <i>Bowed their faces to the ground. </i>Such respect for angels is common: Dan 7:28; 10:9, 15.</p>
<A NAME="2415"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=3296><b>sn</b> By referring to Jesus as <i>the living</i>, the angels make it clear that he is alive. There should be no surprise.</p>
<A NAME="2416"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=3297><b>tc</b> The phrase &#8220;He is not here, but has been raised&#8221; is omitted by a few <sc>mss (D it), but it has wide ms support and differs slightly from the similar statement in Matt 28:6 and Mark 16:6. Although NA<sup>27</sup> places the phrase at the beginning of v. 6, as do most modern English translations, it is omitted from the RSV and placed at the end of v. 5 in the NRSV.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> The verb here is passive (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7968;&#947;&#941;&#961;&#952;&#951;</font>, <font face="Greektl">hgerqh</font>). This &#8220;divine passive&#8221; (see <i>ExSyn</i> 437-38) points to the fact that Jesus was raised by God, and such activity by God is a consistent Lukan theological emphasis: Luke 20:37; 24:34; Acts 3:15; 4:10; 5:30; 10:40; 13:30, 37. A passive construction is also used to refer to Jesus&#8217; exaltation: Luke 24:51; Acts 1:11, 22. </p>
<A NAME="2417"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=3298><b>sn</b> <i>While he was still in Galilee</i> looks back to the beginning of Jesus&#8217; ministry. So the point is that this was announced long ago, and should come as no surprise.</p>
<A NAME="2418"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=3299><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;saying that,&#8221; but this would be redundant in English. Although the translation represents this sentence as indirect discourse, the Greek could equally be taken as direct discourse: &#8220;Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee: &#8216;the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2419"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=3300><b>tn</b> See Luke 9:22, 44; 13:33.</p>
<A NAME="2420"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=3301><b>tn</b> Because in the historical context the individuals who were primarily responsible for the death of Jesus (the Jewish leadership in Jerusalem in Luke&#8217;s view [see Luke 9:22]) would have been men, the translation &#8220;sinful men&#8221; for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#8061;&#960;&#969;&#957; &#7937;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#969;&#955;&#8182;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anqrwpwn Jamartwlwn</font>) is retained here.</p>
<A NAME="2421"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=3302><b>sn</b> See the note on <i>crucify</i> in 23:21.</p>
<A NAME="2422"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=3303><b>tn</b> Here the infinitive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#8134;&#957;&#945;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anasthnai</font>) is active rather than passive.</p>
<A NAME="2423"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=3304><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;then&#8221; to indicate the implied sequence of events within the narrative.</p>
<A NAME="2424"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=3305><b>sn</b> On <i>his words </i>see Luke 9:22.</p>
<A NAME="2425"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=3306><b>sn</b> Judas is now absent and &#8220;the twelve&#8221; have now become &#8220;<i>the eleven</i>.&#8221; Other disciples are also gathered with the remaining eleven.</p>
<A NAME="2426"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=3307><b>sn</b> <i>Mary Magdalene</i> is always noted first in the appearance lists in the gospels. It is unusual that the first appearance would involve women as in this culture their role as witnesses would not be well accepted. It is a sign of the veracity of the account, because if an ancient were to create such a story he would never have it start with women.</p>
<A NAME="2427"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=3308><b>sn</b> On <i>Joanna </i>see Luke 8:1-3.</p>
<A NAME="2428"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=3309><b>sn</b> The term <i>pure nonsense</i> can describe idle talk or a tale. The point is important, since the disciples reacted with disbelief that a resurrection was possible. Sometimes it is thought the ancients were gullible enough to believe anything. But these disciples needed convincing about the resurrection.</p>
<A NAME="2429"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=3310><b>sn</b> While the others dismissed the report of the women, Peter <i>got up and ran to the tomb</i>, for he had learned to believe in what the Lord had said.</p>
<A NAME="2430"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=3311><b>sn</b> In most instances the entrance to such tombs was less than 3 ft (1 m) high, so that an adult would have to bend down and practically crawl inside.</p>
<A NAME="2431"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=3312><b>tn</b> In the NT this term is used only for strips of cloth used to wrap a body for burial (LN 6.154; BDAG 693 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8000;&#952;&#972;&#957;&#953;&#959;&#957;</font>).</p>
<A NAME="2432"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=3313><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;went away, wondering to himself.&#8221; The prepositional phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#7953;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#972;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pros Jeauton</font>) can be understood with the preceding verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#8134;&#955;&#952;&#949;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">aphlqen</font>) or with the following participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#945;&#965;&#956;&#940;&#950;&#969;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">qaumazwn</font>), but it more likely belongs with the former (cf. John 20:10, where the phrase can only refer to the verb).</p>
<A NAME="2433"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=3314><b>sn</b> Peter&#8217;s <i>wondering</i> was not a lack of faith, but struggling in an attempt to understand what could have happened.</p>
<A NAME="2434"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=3315><b>tc</b> Some Western <sc>mss (D it) lack <b>24:12.</b> The verse has been called a Western noninterpolation, meaning that it reflects a shorter authentic reading in D and other Western witnesses. Many regard all such shorter readings as original (the verse is omitted in the RSV), but the ms evidence for omission is far too slight for the verse to be rejected as secondary. It is included in <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>75</sup> and the rest of the ms tradition.</p>
<A NAME="2435"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=3316><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And behold.&#8221; Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;now&#8221; to indicate the transition to a new topic. The Greek word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7984;&#948;&#959;&#973;</font> (<font face="Greektl">idou</font>) at the beginning of this statement has not been translated because it has no exact English equivalent here, but adds interest and emphasis (BDAG 468 s.v. 1).</p>
<A NAME="2436"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=3317><b>tn</b> These are disciples as they know about the empty tomb and do not know what to make of it all.</p>

<A NAME="2449"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=3330><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;answering him, said.&#8221; This is redundant in English and has been simplified in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="2450"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=3331><b>sn</b> There is irony and almost a sense of mocking disbelief as the question &#8220;<i>Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who doesn&#8217;t know the things that have happened there in these days?</i>&#8221; comes to Jesus; but, of course, the readers know what the travelers do not.</p>
