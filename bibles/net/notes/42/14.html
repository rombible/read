<A NAME="1434"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=2122><b>sn</b> The point of the statement<i> the one who humbles himself will be exalted</i> is humility and the reversal imagery used to underline it is common: Luke 1:52-53; 6:21; 10:15; 18:14.</p>

Translators usually try to find two terms for a meal to use as equivalents (e.g., lunch and dinner, dinner and supper, etc.). In this translation &#8220;dinner&#8221; and &#8220;banquet&#8221; have been used, since the expected presence of rich neighbors later in the verse suggests a rather more elaborate occasion than an ordinary meal.</p>
<A NAME="1438"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=2126><b>tn</b> This term, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#959;&#967;&#8053;</font> (<font face="Greektl">doch</font>), is a third term for a meal (see v. 12) that could also be translated &#8220;banquet, feast.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="1458"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=2146><b>sn</b> To <i>make excuses</i> and cancel at this point was an insult in the culture of the time. Regardless of customs concerning responses to invitations, refusal at this point was rude.</p>

<A NAME="1460"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=2148><b>sn</b> The expression <i>Please excuse me</i> is probably a polite way of refusing, given the dynamics of the situation, although it is important to note that an initial acceptance had probably been indicated and it was now a bit late for a refusal.

Why this disqualifies attendance is not clear. The OT freed a newly married man from certain responsibilities such as serving in the army (Deut 20:7; 24:5), but that would hardly apply to a banquet.

However, the emphasis in the present context is on identifying these individuals as the ones previously invited, examples of which were given in vv. 18-20. Cf. also BDAG 79 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#8053;&#961;</font> 2.</p>
<A NAME="1482"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">82</span><note=2170><b>sn</b> <i>None of those individuals who were invited. </i>This is both the point and the warning. To be a part of the original invitation does not mean one automatically has access to blessing. One must respond when the summons comes in order to participate. The summons came in the person of Jesus and his proclamation of the kingdom. The statement here refers to the fact that many in Israel will not be blessed with participation, for they have ignored the summons when it came.</p>

The first part of the illustration (<i>sit down first and determine</i>) deals with preparation. The second part of the illustration (<i>ask for terms of peace</i>) has to do with recognizing who is stronger. This could well suggest thinking about what refusing the &#8220;stronger one&#8221; (God) might mean, and thus constitutes a warning. Achieving peace with God, the more powerful king, is the point of the illustration.</p>
<A NAME="14105"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">105</span><note=2193><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Likewise therefore every one of you who does not renounce all his own possessions cannot be my disciple.&#8221; The complex double negation is potentially confusing to the modern reader and has been simplified in the translation. See L&amp;N 57.70.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The application of the saying is this: Discipleship requires that God be in first place. The reference to renunciation of <i>all his own possessions</i> refers to all earthly attachments that have first place.</p>
<A NAME="14106"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">106</span><note=2194><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Now salt&#8230;&#8221;; here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</font> has not been translated.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Salt</i> was used as seasoning or fertilizer (BDAG 41 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7941;&#955;&#945;&#962;</font> a), or as a preservative. If salt ceased to be useful, it was thrown away. With this illustration Jesus warned about a disciple who ceased to follow him.</p>
<A NAME="14107"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">107</span><note=2195><b>sn</b> The difficulty of this saying is understanding how <i>salt </i>could lose <i>its flavor</i> since its chemical properties cannot change. It is thus often assumed that Jesus was referring to chemically impure salt, perhaps a natural salt which, when exposed to the elements, had all the genuine salt leached out, leaving only the sediment or impurities behind. Others have suggested the background of the saying is the use of salt blocks by Arab bakers to line the floor of their ovens: Under the intense heat these blocks would eventually crystallize and undergo a change in chemical composition, finally being thrown out as unserviceable. A saying in the Talmud (<i>b. Bekhorot </i>8b) attributed to R. Joshua ben Chananja (ca. <sc>a.d. 90), when asked the question &#8220;When salt loses its flavor, how can it be made salty again?&#8221; is said to have replied, &#8220;By salting it with the afterbirth of a mule.&#8221; He was then asked, &#8220;Then does the mule (being sterile) bear young?&#8221; to which he replied: &#8220;Can salt lose its flavor?&#8221; The point appears to be, both are impossible. The saying, while admittedly late, suggests that culturally the loss of flavor by salt was regarded as an impossibility. Genuine salt can never lose its flavor. In this case the saying by Jesus here may be similar to Matt 19:24, where it is likewise impossible for the camel to go through the eye of a sewing needle.</p>

<A NAME="14110"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">110</span><note=2198><b>tn</b> The translation &#8220;had better listen!&#8221; captures the force of the third person imperative more effectively than the traditional &#8220;let him hear,&#8221; which sounds more like a permissive than an imperative to the modern English reader. This was Jesus&#8217; common expression to listen and heed carefully (cf. Matt 11:15; 13:9, 43; Mark 4:9, 23; Luke 8:8).</p>
