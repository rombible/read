<A NAME="1817"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2510><b>sn</b> <i>Listen to what the unrighteous judge says! </i>The point of the parable is that the judge&#8217;s lack of compassion was overcome by the widow&#8217;s persistence.</p>

<A NAME="1820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2513><b>tn</b> The emphatic particles in this sentence indicate that God will indeed give justice to the righteous.</p>
<A NAME="1821"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2514><b>sn</b> The issue of <i>delay</i> has produced a whole host of views for this verse. (1) Does this assume provision to endure in the meantime? Or (2) does it mean God restricts the level of persecution until he comes? Either view is possible.</p>

<A NAME="1829"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2522><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;stood by himself and prayed like this.&#8221; The prepositional phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#7953;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#972;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pros eauton</font>, &#8220;to/about himself&#8221;) could go with either the aorist participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#964;&#945;&#952;&#949;&#943;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">staqeis</font>, &#8220;stood&#8221;) or with the imperfect verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#951;&#973;&#967;&#949;&#964;&#959;</font> (<font face="Greektl">proshuceto</font>, &#8220;he prayed&#8221;). If taken with the participle, then the meaning would seem at first glance to be: &#8220;stood &#8216;by himself&#8217;,&#8221; or &#8220;stood &#8216;alone&#8217;.&#8221; Now it is true that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#972;&#962;</font> can mean &#8220;by&#8221; or &#8220;with&#8221; when used with intransitive verbs such as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7989;&#963;&#964;&#951;&#956;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">{isthmi</font>, &#8220;I stand&#8221;; cf. BDAG 874 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#972;&#962;</font> 2.a), but <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#7953;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#972;&#957;</font> together never means &#8220;by himself&#8221; or &#8220;alone&#8221; in biblical Greek. On the other hand, if <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#7953;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#972;&#957;</font> is taken with the verb, then two different nuances emerge, both of which highlight in different ways the principal point Jesus seems to be making about the arrogance of this religious leader: (1) &#8220;prayed <i>to</i> himself,&#8221; but not necessarily silently, or (2) &#8220;prayed <i>about</i> himself,&#8221; with the connotation that he prayed out loud, for all to hear. Since his prayer is really a review of his moral résumé, directed both at advertising his own righteousness and exposing the perversion of the tax collector, whom he actually mentions in his prayer, the latter option seems preferable. If this is the case, then the Pharisee&#8217;s mention of God is really nothing more than a formality.</p>
<A NAME="1830"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2523><b>sn</b> The Pharisee&#8217;s prayer started out as a thanksgiving psalm to <i>God</i>, but the praise ended up not being about God.</p>

<A NAME="1853"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=2546><b>sn</b> The point of the comparison <i>receive the kingdom of God like a child</i> has more to do with a child&#8217;s trusting spirit and willingness to be dependent and receive from others than any inherent humility the child might possess.</p>

<A NAME="1856"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=2549><b>sn</b> Only Luke states this man is a <i>ruler</i> (cf. the parallels in Matt 19:16-22 and Mark 10:17-22, where the questioner is described only as &#8220;someone&#8221;). He is probably a civic leader of some kind, a leader in the society.</p>
<A NAME="1857"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=2550><b>sn</b> The rich man wanted to know what he must <i>do to inherit eternal life</i>, but Jesus had just finished teaching that eternal life was not earned but simply received (18:17).

<A NAME="1859"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=2552><b>sn</b> Jesus&#8217; response, <i>Why do you call me good?</i>, was designed to cause the ruler to stop and think for a moment about who Jesus really was. The following statement <i>No one is good except God alone</i> seems to point the man in the direction of Jesus&#8217; essential nature and the demands which logically follow on the man for having said it.</p>
<A NAME="1860"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=2553><b>sn</b> A quotation from Exod 20:12-16 and Deut 5:16-20. Jesus cited the parts of the ten commandments that relate to how others should be treated.</p>
