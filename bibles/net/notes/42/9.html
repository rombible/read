<A NAME="923"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1328><b>tn</b> This is a distributive use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#940;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kata</font>); see L&amp;N 83:12 where this verse is cited as an example of the usage.</p>
<A NAME="924"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1329><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;preaching the gospel.&#8221; </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This verse is similar to Luke 9:2, except for <i>good news</i> at this point. The change means that to &#8220;preach the kingdom&#8221; is to &#8220;preach the good news.&#8221; The ideas are interchangeable as summaries for the disciples&#8217; message. They are combined in Luke 8:1.</p>
<A NAME="925"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1330><b>sn</b> <i>Herod</i> refers here to Herod Antipas. See the note on <i>Herod</i> Antipas in 3:1.</p>

<A NAME="928"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1333><b>sn</b> <i>John</i> refers to John the Baptist, whom Herod had beheaded (v. 9).</p>
<A NAME="929"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1334><b>sn</b> The appearance of <i>Elijah</i> would mean that the end time had come. According to 2 Kgs 2:11, Elijah was still alive. In Mal 4:5 it is said that Elijah would be the precursor of Messiah.</p>
<A NAME="930"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1335><b>sn</b> The phrase <i>had risen</i> could be understood to mean &#8220;had been resurrected,&#8221; but this is only a possible option, not a necessary one, since the phrase could merely mean that a figure had appeared on the scene who mirrored an earlier historical figure. The three options of vv. 7-8 will be repeated in v. 19.</p>
<A NAME="931"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1336><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;John I beheaded&#8221;; John&#8217;s name is in emphatic position in the Greek text. The verb is causative, since Herod would not have personally carried out the execution.</p>

See I. H. Marshall, <i>Luke</i> (NIGTC), 357. Herod finally got his wish in Luke 23:6-12, with inconclusive results from his point of view.</p>

The variants can be grouped generally into those that speak of a &#8220;deserted place&#8221; and those that speak of a place/city/town called Bethsaida. The Byzantine reading is evidently a conflation of the earlier texts, and should be dismissed as secondary. The variants that speak of a deserted place are an assimilation to Mark 6:32, as well a harmonization with v. 12, and should also be regarded as secondary. The reading that best explains the rise of the others &#8211; both internally and externally &#8211; is the one that stands behind the translation and is found in the text of NA<sup>27</sup>.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;city.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="9193"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">193</span><note=1498><b>sn</b> There are several options for the meaning of Jesus&#8217; reply <i>Leave the dead to bury their own dead</i>: (1) Recent research suggests that burial customs in the vicinity of Jerusalem from about 20 <sc>b.c. to <sc>a.d. 70 involved a reinterment of the bones a year after the initial burial, once the flesh had rotted away. At that point the son would have placed his father&#8217;s bones in a special box known as an ossuary to be set into the wall of the tomb. Thus Jesus could well be rebuking the man for wanting to wait around for as much as a year before making a commitment to follow him. In 1st century Jewish culture, to have followed Jesus rather than burying one&#8217;s father would have seriously dishonored one&#8217;s father (cf. Tobit 4:3-4). (2) The remark is an idiom (possibly a proverbial saying) that means, &#8220;The matter in question is not the real issue,&#8221; in which case Jesus was making a wordplay on the wording of the man&#8217;s (literal) request (see L&amp;N 33.137). (3) This remark could be a figurative reference to various kinds of people, meaning, &#8220;Let the spiritually dead bury the dead.&#8221; (4) It could also be literal and designed to shock the hearer by the surprise of the contrast. Whichever option is preferred, it is clear that the most important priority is to preach the gospel (<i>proclaim the kingdom of God</i>).</p>

<A NAME="9199"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">199</span><note=1504><b>sn</b> Jesus warns that excessive concern for family ties (<i>looks back</i>) will make the kingdom a lesser priority, which is not appropriate for discipleship. The image is graphic, for who can plow straight ahead toward a goal while looking back? Discipleship cannot be double-minded.</p>
