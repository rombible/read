<a name="11"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Since&#8221; or &#8220;Because.&#8221; This begins a long sentence that extends through v. 4. Because of the length and complexity of the Greek sentence and the tendency of contemporary English style to use shorter sentences, the Greek sentence has been divided up into shorter English sentences in the translation.</p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2><b>tn</b> This is sometimes translated &#8220;narrative,&#8221; but the term itself can refer to an oral or written account. It is the verb &#8220;undertaken&#8221; which suggests a written account, since it literally is &#8220;to set one&#8217;s hand&#8221; to something (BDAG 386 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#941;&#969;</font>). &#8220;Narrative&#8221; is too specific, denoting a particular genre of work for the accounts that existed in the earlier tradition. Not all of that material would have been narrative.</p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=3><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;events.&#8221;</p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=4><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;have been accomplished.&#8221; Given Luke&#8217;s emphasis on divine design (e.g., Luke 24:43-47) a stronger sense (&#8220;fulfilled&#8221;) is better than a mere reference to something having taken place (&#8220;accomplished&#8221;).</p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=5><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;even as&#8221;; this compares the recorded tradition of 1:1 with the original eyewitness tradition of 1:2.</p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=6><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;delivered.&#8221;</p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=7><b>sn</b> The phrase <i>eyewitnesses and servants of the word</i> refers to a single group of people who faithfully passed on the accounts about Jesus. The language about delivery (<i>passed on</i>) points to accounts faithfully passed on to the early church.</p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=8><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;like the accounts those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word passed on to us.&#8221; The location of &#8220;in the beginning&#8221; in the Greek shows that the tradition is rooted in those who were with Jesus from the start.</p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=9><b>tn</b> The conjunction &#8220;so&#8221; is supplied here to bring out the force of the latter part of this Greek sentence, which the translation divides up because of English style. Luke, in compiling his account, is joining a tradition with good precedent.</p>
<a name="110"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=10><b>sn</b> When Luke says <i>it seemed good to me as well </i>he is not being critical of the earlier accounts, but sees himself stepping into a tradition of reporting about Jesus to which he will add uniquely a second volume on the early church when he writes the Book of Acts.</p>
<a name="111"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=11><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;having followed&#8221;; the participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#951;&#954;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#965;&#952;&#951;&#954;&#972;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">parhkolouqhkoti</font>) has been translated causally.</p>
<a name="112"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=12><b>sn</b> <i>An orderly account</i> does not necessarily mean that all events are recorded in the exact chronological sequence in which they occurred, but that the account produced is an orderly one. This could include, for example, thematic or topical order rather than strict chronological order.</p>
<a name="113"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=13><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;know the truth about&#8221;; or &#8220;know the certainty of.&#8221; The issue of the context is psychological confidence; Luke&#8217;s work is trying to encourage Theophilus. So in English this is better translated as &#8220;know for certain&#8221; than &#8220;know certainty&#8221; or &#8220;know the truth,&#8221; which sounds too cognitive. &#8220;Certain&#8221; assumes the truth of the report. On this term, see Acts 2:36; 21:34; 22:30; and 25:26. The meaning &#8220;have assurance concerning&#8221; is also possible here.</p>
<a name="114"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=14><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;you heard about.&#8221; This term can refer merely to a report of information (Acts 21:24) or to instruction (Acts 18:25). The scope of Luke&#8217;s Gospel as a whole, which calls for perseverance in the faith and which assumes much knowledge of the OT, suggests Theophilus had received some instruction and was probably a believer.</p>
<a name="115"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=15><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;It happened that in the days.&#8221; The introductory phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#947;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#959;</font> (<font face="Greektl">egeneto</font>, &#8220;it happened that&#8221;), common in Luke (69 times) and Acts (54 times), is redundant in contemporary English and has not been translated.</p>
<a name="116"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=16><b>sn</b> <i>Herod </i>was Herod the Great, who ruled Palestine from 37 <span class="smallcaps">b.c.</span> until he died in 4 <span class="smallcaps">b.c.</span> He was known for his extensive building projects (including the temple in Jerusalem) and for his cruelty.</p>
<a name="117"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=17><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;of&#8221;; but the meaning of the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ek</font>) is more accurately expressed in contemporary English by the relative clause &#8220;who belonged to.&#8221;</p>
<a name="118"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=18><b>sn</b> There were twenty-four divisions of priesthood and <i>the priestly division of Abijah</i> was eighth on the list according to 1 Chr 24:10.</p>

<a name="121"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=21><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And they.&#8221; Because of the difference between Greek style, which often begins sentences or clauses with &#8220;and,&#8221; and English style, which generally does not, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has not been translated here.</p>

Thus a practical righteousness is meant here (Gen 6:8; Deut 28:9).</p>
<a name="123"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=23><b>tn</b> The predicate adjective has the effect of an adverb here (BDF §243).</p>
<a name="124"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=24><b>sn</b> <i>Elizabeth was barren. </i>Both Zechariah and Elizabeth are regarded by Luke as <i>righteous in the sight of God, following all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blamelessly</i> (v. 6). With this language, reminiscent of various passages in the OT, Luke is probably drawing implicit comparisons to the age and barrenness of such famous OT personalities as Abraham and Sarah (see, e.g., Gen 18:9-15), the mother of Samson (Judg 13:2-5), and Hannah, the mother of Samuel (1 Sam 1:1-20). And, as it was in the case of these OT saints, so it is with Elizabeth: After much anguish and seeking the Lord, she too is going to have a son in her barrenness. In that day it was a great reproach to be childless, for children were a sign of God&#8217;s blessing (cf. Gen 1:28; Lev 20:20-21; Pss 127 and 128; Jer 22:30). As the dawn of salvation draws near, however, God will change this elderly couple&#8217;s grief into great joy and grant them the one desire time had rendered impossible.</p>
<a name="125"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=25><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;were both advanced in days&#8221; (an idiom for old age).</p>

<a name="129"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=29><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;according to the custom of the priesthood it fell to him by lot.&#8221; The order of the clauses has been rearranged in the translation to make it clear that the prepositional phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#964;&#8056; &#7956;&#952;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#7985;&#949;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#949;&#943;&#945;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kata to eqo&quot; th&quot; Jierateia&quot;</font>, &#8220;according to the custom of the priesthood&#8221;) modifies the phrase &#8220;it fell to him by lot&#8221; rather than the preceding clause.</p>
<a name="130"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=30><b>tn</b> This is an aorist participle and is temporally related to the offering of incense, not to when the lot fell.</p>

It would be offered either at 9 a.m. or 3 p.m., since it was made twice a day.</p>
<a name="132"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=32><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And,&#8221; but &#8220;now&#8221; better represents the somewhat parenthetical nature of this statement in the flow of the narrative.</p>

<a name="1147"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">147</span><note=147><b>sn</b> The following passage has been typeset as poetry because many scholars regard this passage as poetic or hymnic. These terms are used broadly to refer to the genre of writing, not to the content. There are two broad criteria for determining if a passage is poetic or hymnic: &#8220;(a) <i>stylistic:</i> a certain rhythmical lilt when the passages are read aloud, the presence of <i>parallelismus membrorum</i> (i.e., an arrangement into couplets), the semblance of some metre, and the presence of rhetorical devices such as alliteration, <i>chiasmus</i>, and antithesis; and (b) <i>linguistic: </i>an unusual vocabulary, particularly the presence of theological terms, which is different from the surrounding context&#8221; (P. T. O&#8217;Brien, <i>Philippians </i>[NIGTC], 188-89). Classifying a passage as hymnic or poetic is important because understanding this genre can provide keys to interpretation. However, not all scholars agree that the above criteria are present in this passage, so the decision to typeset it as poetry should be viewed as a tentative decision about its genre.</p>

<a name="1212"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">212</span><note=212><b>sn</b> The phrase <i>raised up</i> means for God to bring someone significant onto the scene of history.</p>
<a name="1213"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">213</span><note=213><b>sn</b> The<i> horn of salvation </i>is a figure that refers to the power of Messiah and his ability to protect, as the horn refers to what an animal uses to attack and defend (Ps 75:4-5, 10; 148:14; 2 Sam 22:3). Thus the meaning of the figure is &#8220;a powerful savior.&#8221;</p>
<a name="1214"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">214</span><note=214><b>sn</b> <i>In the house of his servant David</i> is a reference to Messiah&#8217;s Davidic descent. Zechariah is more interested in Jesus than his own son John at this point.</p>

<a name="1217"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">217</span><note=217><b>sn</b> The theme of being <i>saved from our enemies </i>is like the release Jesus preached in Luke 4:18-19. Luke&#8217;s narrative shows that one of the enemies in view is Satan and his cohorts, with the grip they have on humanity.</p>
<a name="1218"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">218</span><note=218><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;He has done this&#8221; (referring to the raising up of the horn of salvation from David&#8217;s house) are not in the Greek text, but are supplied to allow a new sentence to be started in the translation. The Greek sentence is lengthy and complex at this point, while contemporary English uses much shorter sentences.</p>
<a name="1219"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">219</span><note=219><b>sn</b> <i>Mercy </i>refers to God&#8217;s loyal love (steadfast love) by which he completes his promises. See Luke 1:50.</p>

<a name="1221"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">221</span><note=221><b>sn</b> The promises of God can be summarized as being found in the one promise (<i>the oath that he swore</i>) to Abraham (Gen 12:1-3).</p>
<a name="1222"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">222</span><note=222><b>tn</b> This is linked back grammatically by apposition to &#8220;covenant&#8221; in v. 72, specifying which covenant is meant.</p>

<a name="1224"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">224</span><note=224><b>tn</b> Again for reasons of English style, the infinitival clause &#8220;to grant us&#8221; has been translated &#8220;This oath grants&#8221; and made the beginning of a new sentence in the translation.</p>

<a name="1226"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">226</span><note=226><b>tn</b> This phrase in Greek is actually thrown forward to the front of the verse to give it emphasis.</p>
<a name="1227"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">227</span><note=227><b>sn</b> The phrases <i>that we&#8230;might serve him&#8230;in holiness and righteousness</i> from Luke 1:74-75 well summarize a basic goal for a believer in the eyes of Luke. Salvation frees us up to serve God without fear through a life full of ethical integrity.</p>

<a name="1231"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">231</span><note=231><b>sn</b> In other words, John is a <i>prophet</i> of God; see 1:32 and 7:22-23, 28.</p>

<a name="1237"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">237</span><note=237><b>sn</b> God&#8217;s loyal love (steadfast love) is again the topic, reflected in the phrase <i>tender mercy</i>; see Luke 1:72.</p>

The Messiah is pictured as a saving light that shows the way. The Greek term was also used to translate the Hebrew word for &#8220;branch&#8221; or &#8220;sprout,&#8221; so some see a double entendre here with messianic overtones (see Isa 11:1-10; Jer 23:5; 33:15; Zech 3:8; 6:12).</p>
