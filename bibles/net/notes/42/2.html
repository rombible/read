The verb is regarded as a technical term for official registration in tax lists (BDAG 108 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#947;&#961;&#940;&#966;&#969;</font> a).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This census (<i>a decree&#8230;to register all the empire</i>) is one of the more disputed historical remarks in Luke. Josephus (<i>Ant.</i> 18.1.1 [18.1-2]) only mentions a census in <sc>a.d. 6, too late for this setting. Such a census would have been a massive undertaking; it could have started under one ruler and emerged under another, to whose name it became attached. This is one possibility to explain the data. Another is that Quirinius, who became governor in Syria for the later census, may have been merely an administrator for this census. See also Luke 2:2.</p>
<A NAME="26"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=251><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the whole (inhabited) world,&#8221; but this was a way to refer to the Roman empire (L&amp;N 1.83).</p>

<A NAME="212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=257><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;town.&#8221; The translation &#8220;city&#8221; is used here because of its collocation with &#8220;of David,&#8221; suggesting its importance, though not its size.</p>
<A NAME="213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=258><b>sn</b> The journey from Nazareth <i>to the city of David called Bethlehem</i> was a journey of about 90 mi (150 km). Bethlehem was a small village located about 7 miles south-southwest of Jerusalem.</p><p class="footnote"><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map7-E2; Map8-E2; Map10-B4.</p>
<A NAME="214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=259><b>sn</b> Luke&#8217;s use of the term &#8220;house&#8221; probably alludes to the original promise made to David outlined in the Nathan oracle of 2 Sam 7:12-16, especially in light of earlier connections between Jesus and David made in Luke 1:32. Further, the mention of Bethlehem reminds one of the promise of Mic 5:2, namely, that a great king would emerge from Bethlehem to rule over God&#8217;s people.</p>
<A NAME="215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=260><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;family,&#8221; &#8220;lineage.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=262><b>tn</b> Traditionally, &#8220;Mary, his betrothed.&#8221; Although often rendered in contemporary English as &#8220;Mary, who was engaged to him,&#8221; this may give the modern reader a wrong impression, since Jewish marriages in this period were typically arranged marriages. The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#956;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#965;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#8131;</font> (<font face="Greektl">emnhsteumenh</font>) may suggest that the marriage is not yet consummated, not necessarily that they are not currently married. Some <sc>mss read &#8220;the betrothed to him wife&#8221;; others, simply &#8220;his wife.&#8221; These readings, though probably not original, may give the right sense.</p>
<A NAME="218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=263><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And it happened that while.&#8221; The introductory phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#947;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#959;</font> (<font face="Greektl">egeneto</font>, &#8220;it happened that&#8221;), common in Luke (69 times) and Acts (54 times), is redundant in contemporary English and has not been translated. Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has not been translated because of differences between Greek and English style.</p>
<A NAME="219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=264><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;her child&#8221; are not in the Greek text, but have been supplied to clarify what was being delivered. The wording here is like Luke 1:57. <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the days for her to give birth were fulfilled.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=265><b>sn</b> The <i>strips of cloth </i>(traditionally, &#8220;swaddling cloths&#8221;) were strips of linen that would be wrapped around the arms and legs of an infant to keep the limbs protected.</p>
<A NAME="221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=266><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;a feeding trough.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=267><b>tn</b> The Greek word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#940;&#955;&#965;&#956;&#945;</font> is flexible, and usage in the LXX and NT refers to a variety of places for lodging (see BDAG 521 s.v.). Most likely Joseph and Mary sought lodging in the public accommodations in the city of Bethlehem (see J. Nolland, <i>Luke</i> [WBC], 1:105), which would have been crude shelters for people and animals. However, it has been suggested by various scholars that Joseph and Mary were staying with relatives in Bethlehem (e.g., C. S. Keener, <i>The IVP Bible Background Commentary: New Testament</i>, 194; B. Witherington, &#8220;Birth of Jesus,&#8221; <i>DJG</i>, 69-70); if that were so the term would refer to the guest room in the relatives&#8217; house, which would have been filled beyond capacity with all the other relatives who had to journey to Bethlehem for the census.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>There was no place for them in the inn. </i>There is no drama in how this is told. There is no search for a variety of places to stay or a heartless innkeeper. (Such items are later, nonbiblical embellishments.) Bethlehem was not large and there was simply no other place to stay. The humble surroundings of the birth are ironic in view of the birth&#8217;s significance.</p>
<A NAME="223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=268><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;now&#8221; to indicate the transition to a new topic. </p>
<A NAME="224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=269><b>sn</b> Some argue that <i>shepherds</i> were among the culturally despised, but the evidence for this view of shepherds is late, coming from 5th century Jewish materials. December 25 as the celebrated date of Jesus&#8217; birth arose around the time of Constantine (ca. <sc>a.d. 306-337), though it is mentioned in material from Hippolytus (<sc>a.d. 165-235). Some think that the reason for celebration on this date was that it coincided with the pagan Roman festival of Saturnalia, and Christians could celebrate their own festival at this time without fear of persecution. On the basis of the statement that the shepherds were <i>living out in the field, keeping guard over their flock at night</i> it is often suggested that Jesus&#8217; birth took place in early spring, since it was only at lambing time that shepherds stood guard over their flocks in the field. This is not absolutely certain, however.</p>

<A NAME="233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=278><b>sn</b> The Greek word for <i>today </i>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#8053;&#956;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">shmeron</font>) occurs eleven times in the Gospel of Luke (2:11; 4:21; 5:26; 12:28; 13:32-33; 19:5, 9; 22:34, 61; 23:43) and nine times in Acts. Its use, especially in passages such as 2:11, 4:21, 5:26; 19:5, 9, signifies the dawning of the era of messianic salvation and the fulfillment of the plan of God. Not only does it underscore the idea of present fulfillment in Jesus&#8217; ministry, but it also indicates salvific fulfillment present in the church (cf. Acts 1:6; 3:18; D. L. Bock, <i>Luke</i> [BECNT], 1:412; I. H. Marshall, <i>Luke</i>, [NIGTC], 873).</p>

In the intertestamental period it developed further into a technical term referring to the hoped-for anointed one, that is, a specific individual. In the NT the development starts there (technical-specific), is so used in the gospels, and then develops in Paul to mean virtually Jesus&#8217; last name.</p>

Not only is the genitive reading better attested, but it is more difficult than the nominative. &#8220;The meaning seems to be, not that divine peace can be bestowed only where human good will is already present, but that at the birth of the Saviour God&#8217;s peace rests on those whom he has chosen in accord with his good pleasure&#8221; (<i>TCGNT</i> 111).</p>

<A NAME="260"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=305><b>tc</b> The translation follows most <sc>mss, including early and important ones ({<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A B L}). Some copyists, aware that the purification law applied to women only, produced <sc>mss ({76 it<sup>pt</sup> vg} [though the Latin word <i>eius </i>could be either masculine or feminine]) that read &#8220;her purification.&#8221; But the extant evidence for an unambiguous &#8220;her&#8221; is shut up to one late minuscule ({codex 76}) and a couple of patristic citations of dubious worth ({Pseudo-Athanasius} whose date is unknown, and the {<i>Catenae</i> <i>in euangelia Lucae et Joannis</i>}, edited by J. A. Cramer. The <i>Catenae</i> is a work of collected patristic sayings whose exact source is unknown [thus, it could come from a period covering hundreds of years]). A few other witnesses (D <i>pc</i> lat) read &#8220;his purification.&#8221; The KJV has &#8220;her purification,&#8221; following Beza&#8217;s Greek text (essentially a revision of Erasmus&#8217;). Erasmus did not have it in any of his five editions.

Luke&#8217;s point is that the parents followed the law. They were pious.</p>
