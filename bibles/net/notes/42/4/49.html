The noun is always used in the NT in eschatological contexts; the verb is often so used (cf. Matt 13:39, 40; 24:3; 28:20; Mark 13:4; Rom 9:28; Heb 8:8; 9:26). The idea here may be that the forty-day period of temptation was <i>designed</i> for a particular purpose in the life of Christ (the same verb is used in v. 13). The cognate verb <font face="Greektl">teleiow</font> is a key NT term for the completion of God&#8217;s plan: See Luke 12:50; 22:37; John 19:30; and (where it has the additional component of meaning &#8220;to perfect&#8221;) Heb 2:10; 5:8-9; 7:28.</p>
