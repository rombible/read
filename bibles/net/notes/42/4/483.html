<A NAME="483"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">83</span><note=580><b>sn</b> The remark &#8220;<i>What we have heard that you did at Capernaum</i>&#8221; makes many suspect that Luke has moved this event forward in sequence to typify what Jesus&#8217; ministry was like, since the ministry in Capernaum follows in vv. 31-44. The location of this event in the parallel of Mark 6:1-6 also suggests this transposition.</p><p class="footnote"><b>map</b> For location see Map1-D2; Map2-C3; Map3-B2.</p>
