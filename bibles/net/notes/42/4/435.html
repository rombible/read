<A NAME="435"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=532><b>sn</b> The reference to <i>the highest point of the temple</i> probably refers to the one point on the temple&#8217;s southeast corner where the site looms directly over a cliff some 450 feet (135 m) high. However, some have suggested the reference could be to the temple&#8217;s high gate.</p>
