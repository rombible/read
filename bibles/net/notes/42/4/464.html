<A NAME="464"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=561><b>sn</b> <i>The poor</i> is a key term in Luke. It refers to the pious poor and indicates Jesus&#8217; desire to reach out to those the world tends to forget or mistreat. It is like 1:52 in force and also will be echoed in 6:20 (also 1 Pet 2:11-25). Jesus is commissioned to do this.</p>
