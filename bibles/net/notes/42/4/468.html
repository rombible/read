<A NAME="468"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">68</span><note=565><b>sn</b> The essence of Jesus&#8217; messianic work is expressed in the phrase <i>to set free</i>. This line from Isa 58 says that Jesus will do what the nation had failed to do. It makes the proclamation messianic, not merely prophetic, because Jesus doesn&#8217;t just proclaim the message &#8211; he brings the deliverance. The word translated <i>set free</i> is the same Greek word (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#966;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">afesi&quot;</font>) translated <i>release</i> earlier in the verse.</p>
