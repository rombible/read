<A NAME="459"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=556><b>sn</b> In normative Judaism of the period, the OT scripture was read and discussed in the synagogue by the men who were present. See the Mishnah, <i>m. Megillah</i> 3-4; <i>m. Berakhot</i> 2. First came the law, then the prophets, then someone was asked to speak on the texts. Normally one <i>stood up to read</i> out of respect for the scriptures, and then <i>sat down</i> (v. 20) to expound them.</p>
