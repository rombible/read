<A NAME="4113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">113</span><note=610><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;What to us and to you?&#8221; This is an idiom meaning, &#8220;We have nothing to do with one another,&#8221; or &#8220;Why bother us!&#8221; The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#943; &#7969;&#956;&#8150;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#963;&#959;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ti Jhmin kai soi</font>) is Semitic in origin, though it made its way into colloquial Greek (BDAG 275 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#947;&#8061;</font>). The equivalent Hebrew expression in the Old Testament had two basic meanings: (1) When one person was unjustly bothering another, the injured party could say &#8220;What to me and to you?&#8221; meaning, &#8220;What have I done to you that you should do this to me?&#8221; (Judg 11:12; 2 Chr 35:21; 1 Kgs 17:18). (2) When someone was asked to get involved in a matter he felt was no business of his, he could say to the one asking him, &#8220;What to me and to you?&#8221; meaning, &#8220;That is your business, how am I involved?&#8221; (2 Kgs 3:13; Hos 14:8). Option (1) implies hostility, while option (2) merely implies disengagement. BDAG suggests the following as glosses for this expression: <i>What have I to do with you? What have we in common? Leave me alone! Never mind! </i>Hostility between Jesus and the demons is certainly to be understood in this context, hence the translation: &#8220;Leave me alone&#8230;.&#8221; For a very similar expression, see Luke 8:28 and (in a different context) John 2:4.</p>
