<A NAME="486"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">86</span><note=583><b>sn</b> Jesus argues that he will get no respect in his own hometown. There is a wordplay here on the word <i>acceptable</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">dektos</font>), which also occurs in v. 19: Jesus has declared the &#8220;acceptable&#8221; year of the Lord (here translated <i>year of the Lord&#8217;s favor</i>), but he is not &#8220;accepted&#8221; by the people of his own hometown.</p>
