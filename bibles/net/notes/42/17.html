Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> (<font face="Greektl">de</font>) has not been translated.</p>
<A NAME="172"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2397><b>sn</b> See Luke 6:24-26.</p>
<A NAME="173"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2398><b>tn</b> This term refers to the heavy upper stone of a grinding mill (L&amp;N 7.70; BDAG 660 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#965;&#955;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#962;</font>). </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The punishment of drowning with a heavy weight attached is extremely gruesome and reflects Jesus&#8217; views concerning those who cause others who believe in him to sin.</p>
<A NAME="174"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2399><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;if a millstone were tied&#8230;and he were thrown.&#8221; The conditional construction in Greek has been translated by English infinitives: &#8220;to have&#8230; and be thrown.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="175"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2400><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;to stumble.&#8221; This verb, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#954;&#945;&#957;&#948;&#945;&#955;&#943;&#963;&#8131;</font> (<font face="Greektl">skandalish</font>), has the same root as the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#954;&#940;&#957;&#948;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">skandalon</font>) in 17:1, translated &#8220;stumbling blocks&#8221;; this wordplay is difficult to reproduce in English. It is possible that the primary cause of offense here would be leading disciples (&#8220;little ones&#8221;) astray in a similar fashion.</p>
<A NAME="176"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2401><b>tn</b> It is difficult to know if this looks back or forward or both. The warning suggests it looks back. For this verb, see Luke 8:18; 12:1, 15; 20:46; 21:8, 34. The present imperative reflects an ongoing spirit of watchfulness.</p>
<A NAME="177"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2402><b>tn</b> Both the &#8220;if&#8221; clause in this verse and the &#8220;if&#8221; clause in v. 4 are third class conditions in Greek.</p>
<A NAME="178"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2403><b>tn</b> Here the term &#8220;brother&#8221; means &#8220;fellow believer&#8221; or &#8220;fellow Christian&#8221; (cf. BDAG 18 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#972;&#962;</font> 2.a, <i>contra</i> BDAG 19 s.v. 2.c), but with a familial connotation. It refers equally to men, women, or children. However, because of the familial connotations, &#8220;brother&#8221; has been retained in the translation here in preference to the more generic &#8220;fellow believer&#8221; (&#8220;fellow Christian&#8221; would be anachronistic in this context).</p>
<A NAME="179"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2404><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And if.&#8221; Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has not been translated because of differences between Greek and English style.</p>
<A NAME="1710"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2405><b>sn</b> <i>You must forgive him. </i>Forgiveness is to be readily given and not withheld. In a community that is to have restored relationships, grudges are not beneficial.</p>
<A NAME="1711"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2406><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And the.&#8221; Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has not been translated because of differences between Greek and English style.</p>
<A NAME="1712"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2407><b>sn</b> The request of the apostles, &#8220;<i>Increase our faith</i>,&#8221;<i> </i>is not a request for a gift of faith, but a request to increase the depth of their faith.</p>
<A NAME="1713"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2408><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> (<font face="Greektl">de</font>) has been translated as &#8220;so&#8221; to indicate the implied result of previous action(s) in the narrative.</p>
<A NAME="1714"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2409><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;said.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1715"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2410><b>tn</b> This is a mixed condition, with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">an</font>) in the apodosis.</p>

<A NAME="1717"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2412><b>sn</b> A <i>black mulberry tree </i>is a deciduous fruit tree that grows about 20 ft (6 m) tall and has black juicy berries. This tree has an extensive root system, so to pull it up would be a major operation.</p>
<A NAME="1718"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2413><b>tn</b> The passives here (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954;&#961;&#953;&#950;&#8061;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#953;</font> and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#966;&#965;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#953;</font>, <font face="Greektl">ekrizwqhti </font>and <font face="Greektl">futeuqhti</font>) are probably a circumlocution for God performing the action (the so-called divine passive, see <i>ExSyn</i> 437-38). The issue is not the amount of faith (which in the example is only very tiny), but its presence, which can accomplish impossible things. To cause a tree to be uprooted and planted in the sea is impossible. The expression is a rhetorical idiom. It is like saying a camel can go through the eye of a needle (Luke 18:25).</p>
<A NAME="1719"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2414><b>tn</b> The verb is aorist, though it looks at a future event, another rhetorical touch to communicate certainty of the effect of faith.</p>
<A NAME="1720"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2415><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Who among you, having a slave&#8230; would say to him.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="1722"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2417><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;and recline at table,&#8221; as 1st century middle eastern meals were not eaten while sitting at a table, but while reclining on one&#8217;s side on the floor with the head closest to the low table and the feet farthest away. See BDAG 70 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#945;&#960;&#943;&#960;&#964;&#969;</font> 1.</p>
<A NAME="1723"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2418><b>tn</b> The question includes a Greek particle, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8016;&#967;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ouci</font>), that expects a positive reply. The slave is expected to prepare a meal before eating himself.</p>

<A NAME="1730"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2425><b>tn</b> Some translations describe the slaves as &#8220;worthless&#8221; (NRSV) or &#8220;unworthy&#8221; (NASB, NIV) but that is not Jesus&#8217; point. These disciples have not done anything deserving special commendation or praise (L&amp;N 33.361), but only what would normally be expected of a slave in such a situation (thus the translation &#8220;we have only done what was our duty&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="1731"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2426><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;we have only done what we were supposed to do.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="1733"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=2428><b>sn</b> This is another travel note about Jesus going to <i>Jerusalem</i> in Luke 9:51-19:48, the so-called &#8220;Jerusalem journey&#8221; section of Luke&#8217;s Gospel. It is not a straight line journey, because to travel along the Galilean and Samaritan border is to go east or west, not south to Jerusalem.</p><p class="footnote"><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>

<A NAME="1737"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=2432><b>tn</b> The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#963;&#949;&#961;&#967;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#965;</font> (<font face="Greektl">eisercomenou</font>) is taken temporally.</p>
<A NAME="1738"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=2433><b>sn</b> The <i>ten men with leprosy</i> would have been unable to approach Jesus (Lev 13:45-46; Num 5:2-3). The ancient term for leprosy covered a wider array of conditions than what is called leprosy today. A leper was totally ostracized from society until he was declared cured (Lev 13:45-46).</p>
<A NAME="1739"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=2434><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;leprosy, who.&#8221; Because of the length and complexity of the Greek sentence, the relative pronoun was replaced with a personal pronoun and a new sentence started at this point in the translation.</p>

<A NAME="1742"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=2437><b>tn</b> The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#959;&#961;&#949;&#965;&#952;&#941;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">poreuqente&quot;</font>) is a good example of an adverbial participle of attendant circumstance. As such, it picks up the force of an imperative from the verb to which it is related (<i>ExSyn</i> 640-45).</p>
<A NAME="1743"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=2438><b>sn</b> These are the instructions of what to do with a healing (Lev 13:19; 14:1-11; Luke 5:14).</p>

<A NAME="1745"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=2440><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;glorifying God.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="1749"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=2444><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;now&#8221; to indicate the introduction of a parenthetical comment. </p>
<A NAME="1750"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=2445><b>sn</b> This is a parenthetical note by the author. The comment that the man was <i>a Samaritan</i> means that to most Jews of Jesus&#8217; day he would have been despised as a half-breed and a heretic. The note adds a touch of irony to the account (v. 18).</p>
<A NAME="1751"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=2446><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> (<font face="Greektl">de</font>) has been translated as &#8220;then&#8221; to indicate the implied sequence of events within the narrative.</p>

<A NAME="1754"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=2449><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;other&#8221; is implied in the context.</p>
<A NAME="1755"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=2450><b>sn</b> Jesus&#8217; point in calling the man a <i>foreigner</i> is that none of the other nine, who were presumably Israelites, responded with gratitude. Only the &#8220;outsiders&#8221; were listening and responding.</p>
<A NAME="1756"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=2451><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;then&#8221; to indicate the implied sequence of events within the narrative.</p>

Apparently the Samaritan benefited from the healing in a way the other nine did not.</p>
<A NAME="1759"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=2454><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;at one point&#8221; are supplied to indicate that the following incident is not necessarily in chronological sequence with the preceding event.</p>
<A NAME="1760"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=2455><b>sn</b> See the note on <i>Pharisees</i> in 5:17.</p>
<A NAME="1761"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=2456><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;having been asked by the Pharisees.&#8221; The passive construction has been translated as an active one in keeping with contemporary English style, and the direct object, Jesus, has been supplied from the context.</p>
<A NAME="1762"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=2457><b>sn</b> <i>The kingdom of God</i> is a major theme of Jesus. It is a realm in which Jesus rules and to which those who trust him belong. See Luke 6:20; 11:20; 17:20-21.</p>
<A NAME="1763"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=2458><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;is not coming in a way that it can be closely watched&#8221; (L&amp;N 24.48). Although there are differing interpretations of what this means, it probably refers to the cosmic signs often associated with the kingdom&#8217;s coming in the Jewish view (<i>1 En.</i> 91, 93; <i>2 Bar.</i> 53&#8212;74). See D. L. Bock, <i>Luke</i> (BECNT), 2:1412-14, also H. Riesenfeld, <i>TDNT</i> 8:150.</p>
<A NAME="1764"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=2459><b>tn</b> This is a present tense in the Greek text. In contrast to waiting and looking for the kingdom, it is now available.</p>
<A NAME="1765"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=2460><b>tn</b> This is a far better translation than &#8220;in you.&#8221; Jesus would never tell the hostile Pharisees that the kingdom was inside them. The reference is to Jesus present in their midst. He brings the kingdom. Another possible translation would be &#8220;in your grasp.&#8221; For further discussion and options, see D. L. Bock, <i>Luke</i> (BECNT), 2:1414-19.</p>

<A NAME="1767"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=2462><b>sn</b> This is a reference to the <i>days</i> of the full manifestation of Jesus&#8217; power in a fully established kingdom. The reference to &#8220;days&#8221; instead of &#8220;day&#8221; is unusual, appearing only here and in v. 26, but it may be motivated merely by parallelism with the &#8220;days&#8221; of Noah there and the &#8220;days of Lot&#8221; in v. 28.</p>
<A NAME="1768"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">68</span><note=2463><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And they will say.&#8221; The plural in Greek is indefinite, referring to people in general.

<A NAME="1789"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">89</span><note=2484><b>sn</b> There is debate among commentators and scholars over the phrase <i>one will be taken and the other left</i> about whether one is taken for judgment or for salvation. If the imagery is patterned after the rescue of Noah from the flood and Lot from Sodom, as some suggest, the ones taken are the saved (as Noah and Lot were) and those left behind are judged. The imagery, however, is not directly tied to the identification of the two groups. Its primary purpose in context is to picture the sudden, surprising separation of the righteous and the judged (i.e., condemned) at the return of the Son of Man.</p>
