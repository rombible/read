<A NAME="22113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">113</span><note=3076><b>tc</b> Several important Greek <sc>mss (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>75</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>1</sup> A B N T W 579 1071*) along with diverse and widespread versional witnesses lack <b>22:43-44</b>. In addition, the verses are placed after Matt 26:39 by <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13</sup>. Floating texts typically suggest both spuriousness and early scribal impulses to regard the verses as <i>historically</i> authentic. These verses are included in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>*<sup>,2</sup> D L <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 0171 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1</sup> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat Ju Ir Hipp Eus. However, a number of <sc>mss mark the text with an asterisk or obelisk, indicating the scribe&#8217;s assessment of the verses as inauthentic. At the same time, these verses generally fit Luke&#8217;s style. Arguments can be given on both sides about whether scribes would tend to include or omit such comments about Jesus&#8217; humanity and an angel&#8217;s help. But even if the verses are not <i>literarily </i>authentic, they are probably <i>historically </i>authentic. This is due to the fact that this text was well known in several different locales from a very early period. Since there are no synoptic parallels to this account and since there is no obvious reason for adding these words here, it is very likely that such verses recount a part of the actual suffering of our Lord. Nevertheless, because of the serious doubts as to these verses&#8217; authenticity, they have been put in brackets. For an important discussion of this problem, see B. D. Ehrman and M. A. Plunkett, &#8220;The Angel and the Agony: The Textual Problem of Luke 22:43-44,&#8221; <i>CBQ</i> 45 (1983): 401-16.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Angelic aid is noted elsewhere in the gospels: Matt 4:11 = Mark 1:13.</p>
