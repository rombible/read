<A NAME="2249"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=3012><b>tc</b> Some important Western <sc>mss (D it) lack the words from this point to the end of v. 20. However, the authenticity of these verses is very likely. The inclusion of the second cup is the harder reading, since it differs from Matt 26:26-29 and Mark 14:22-25, and it has much better ms support. It is thus easier to explain the shorter reading as a scribal accident or misunderstanding. Further discussion of this complicated problem (the most difficult in Luke) can be found in <i>TCGNT</i> 148-50.</p>
