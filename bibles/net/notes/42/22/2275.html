<A NAME="2275"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">75</span><note=3038><b>tc</b> The majority of <sc>mss (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A D W <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13 </sup><font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> as well as several versional witnesses) begin this verse with an introductory comment, &#8220;and the Lord said,&#8221; indicating a change in the subject of discussion. But this is apparently a reading motivated by the need for clarity. Some of the best witnesses, along with a few others (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>75 </sup>B L T 1241 2542<sup>c </sup>sy<sup>s</sup> co), do not contain these words. The abrupt shift is the more difficult reading and thus more likely to be original.</p>
