<A NAME="2245"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=3008><b>sn</b> <i>Then he took a cup. </i>Only Luke mentions two cups at this meal; the other synoptic gospels (Matt, Mark) mention only one. This is the first of the two. It probably refers to the first cup in the traditional Passover meal, which today has four cups (although it is debated whether the fourth cup was used in the 1st century).</p>
