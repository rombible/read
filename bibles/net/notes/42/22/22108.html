<A NAME="22108"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">108</span><note=3071><b>sn</b> Jesus&#8217; instructions to pray not to <i>fall into temptation</i> is an allusion to Luke 22:28-38, especially 22:31. The temptation is Satan&#8217;s challenge to them to defect, like what happened to Judas and what will happen to Peter.</p>
