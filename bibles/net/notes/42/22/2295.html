<A NAME="2295"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">95</span><note=3058><b>tn</b> The syntax of this verse is disputed, resulting in various translations. The major options are either (1) that reflected in the translation or (2) that those who have a money bag and traveler&#8217;s bag should get a sword, just as those who do not have these items should sell their cloak to buy a sword. The point of all the options is that things have changed and one now needs full provisions. Opposition will come. But &#8220;sword&#8221; is a figure for preparing to fight. See Luke 22:50-51.</p>
