<A NAME="2242"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=3005><b>sn</b> Jesus looked to a celebration in the kingdom to come when the Passover <i>is fulfilled</i>. This reference could well suggest that some type of commemorative sacrifice and meal will be celebrated then, as the antecedent is the Passover sacrifice. The reference is not to the Lord&#8217;s supper as some argue, but the Passover.</p>
