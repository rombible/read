<A NAME="22152"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">152</span><note=3115><b>tn</b> A real rooster crowing is probably in view here (rather than the Roman trumpet call known as <i>gallicinium</i>), in part due to the fact that Mark 14:72 mentions the rooster crowing twice. See the discussion at Matt 26:74.</p>
