<A NAME="22132"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">132</span><note=3095><b>tn</b> This title, literally &#8220;official of the temple&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#964;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#951;&#947;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#7985;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#8166;</font>, <font face="Greektl">strathgo&quot; tou Jierou</font>), referred to the commander of the Jewish soldiers who guarded and maintained order in the Jerusalem temple. Here, since the term is plural, it has been translated &#8220;officers of the temple guard&#8221; rather than &#8220;commanders of the temple guard,&#8221; since the idea of a number of commanders might be confusing to the modern English reader.</p>
