<A NAME="7156"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">156</span><note=1110><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;for she loved much.&#8221; The connection between this statement and the preceding probably involves an ellipsis, to the effect that the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause gives the evidence of forgiveness, not the ground. For similar examples of an &#8220;evidentiary&#8221; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font>, cf. Luke 1:22; 6:21; 13:2. See discussion in D. L. Bock, <i>Luke </i>[BECNT], 1:703-5. Further evidence that this is the case here is the final statement: &#8220;the one who is forgiven little loves little&#8221; means that the one who is forgiven little is thus not able to love much. The REB renders this verse: &#8220;her great love proves that her many sins have been forgiven; where little has been forgiven, little love is shown.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>She loved much. </i>Jesus&#8217; point is that the person who realizes how great a gift forgiveness is (because they have a deep sense of sin) has a great love for the one who forgives, that is, God. The woman&#8217;s acts of reverence to Jesus honored him as the one who brought God&#8217;s message of grace.</p>
