<A NAME="7155"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">155</span><note=1109><b>sn</b> This event is not equivalent to the anointing of Jesus that takes place in the last week of his life (Matt 26:6-13; Mark 14:3-9; John 12:1-8). That woman was not a sinner, and Jesus was eating in the home of Simon the leper, who, as a leper, could never be a Pharisee.</p>
