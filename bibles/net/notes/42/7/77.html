<A NAME="77"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=961><b>tn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#956;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">entimos</font>) could mean &#8220;highly valued,&#8221; but this sounds too much like the slave was seen as an asset, while the text suggests a genuine care for the person. More archaically, it could be said the centurion was fond of this slave.</p>
