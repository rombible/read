<A NAME="76"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=960><b>tn</b> Though <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#959;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">doulos</font>) is normally translated &#8220;servant,&#8221; the word does not bear the connotation of a free individual serving another. BDAG notes that &#8220;&#8216;servant&#8217; for &#8216;slave&#8217; is largely confined to Biblical transl. and early American times&#8230; in normal usage at the present time the two words are carefully distinguished&#8221; (BDAG 260 s.v. 1). The most accurate translation is &#8220;bondservant&#8221; (sometimes found in the ASV for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#959;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font>) in that it often indicates one who sells himself into slavery to another. But as this is archaic, few today understand its force. In addition, the parallel passage in Matt 8:6 uses the Greek term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#8150;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pais</font>), to refer to the centurion&#8217;s slave. This was a term often used of a slave who was regarded with some degree of affection, possibly a personal servant.</p>
