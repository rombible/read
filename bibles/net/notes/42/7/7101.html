<A NAME="7101"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">101</span><note=1055><b>sn</b> The<i> kingdom of God</i> is a major theme of Jesus&#8217; proclamation. It is a realm in which Jesus rules and to which those who trust him belong. See Luke 6:20; 11:20; 17:20-21. It is not strictly future, though its full manifestation is yet to come. That is why membership in it starts right after John the Baptist.</p>
