<A NAME="7104"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">104</span><note=1058><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;vindicated God&#8221;; <i>Grk</i> &#8220;justified God.&#8221; This could be expanded to &#8220;vindicated and responded to God.&#8221; The point is that God&#8217;s goodness and grace as evidenced in the invitation to John was justified and responded to by the group one might least expect, tax collector and sinners. They had more spiritual sensitivity than others. The contrastive response is clear from v. 30.</p>
