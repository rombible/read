<A NAME="11125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">125</span><note=1774><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Give the things inside as alms.&#8221; Three different approaches have been taken to the syntax and meaning of this phrase: (1) <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8048; &#7952;&#957;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ta enonta</font>, &#8220;the things inside&#8221;) is an accusative of respect (&#8220;give alms with respect to the things inside&#8221;); (2) <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8048; &#7952;&#957;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#945;</font> is an adverbial accusative (&#8220;give alms inwardly,&#8221; i.e., from the heart); (3) the word translated &#8220;alms&#8221; represents a mistranslation of the original Aramaic term &#8220;cleanse,&#8221; so the statement urges the hearers to &#8220;cleanse the things inside.&#8221; According to D. L. Bock (<i>Luke</i> [BECNT], 2:1115) the latter meaning is unlikely because the present verse is independent of Matt 23:26, not parallel to it, and makes good sense as it stands.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> In Jewish culture giving alms to the poor was a very important religious observance; it was meant to be an act of mercy, kindness, and love (D. L. Bock, <i>Luke</i> [BECNT], 2:1114). The implication from the text is that the Pharisees gave alms, but without any of the spiritual concern which should have motivated those generous actions. Here Jesus commands the Pharisees to give from within themselves to those in need instead of just giving of their possessions. In so doing they would show true inner purity acceptable to God. This is in keeping with the author&#8217;s social concerns elsewhere in the Gospel (cf., e.g., 1:52-53, 4:18-19, 6:20-21, 14:13).</p>
