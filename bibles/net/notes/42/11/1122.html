<A NAME="1122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1671><b>tn</b> The syntax of vv. 6-7 is complex. In the Greek text Jesus&#8217; words in v. 6 begin as a question. Some see Jesus&#8217; question ending at v. 6, but the reply starting in v. 8 favors extending the question through the entire illustration. The translation breaks up the long sentence at the beginning of v. 7 and translates Jesus&#8217; words as a statement for reasons of English style. </p>
