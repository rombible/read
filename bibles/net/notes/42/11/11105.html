<A NAME="11105"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">105</span><note=1754><b>tc</b> The phrase &#8220;or under a basket&#8221; is lacking in some important and early <sc>mss (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>45,75</sup> L <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#915;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#926;</font> 070 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1</sup> 700* 1241 2542 <i>pc </i>sy<sup>s</sup> sa). It is hard to decide in this case, since the inclusion of &#8220;or under a basket&#8221; is widely attested by some early and decent witnesses, as well as the overwhelming majority of <sc>mss (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A B C D W <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13</sup> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> latt). The parallel passage in Luke 8:16 does not include &#8220;under a basket.&#8221; If the phrase &#8220;under a basket&#8221; were added as a harmonization with Mark 4:21 and Matt 5:15, it is perhaps surprising that scribes did not add the phrase at Luke 8:16 as well. It seems somewhat more likely that a scribe copying Luke would be inclined to harmonize 11:33 with 8:16 by omitting the phrase here. Thus, the words &#8220;or under a basket&#8221; seem to have the marks of authenticity.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;a bowl&#8221;; this refers to any container for dry material of about eight liters (two gallons) capacity. It could be translated &#8220;basket, box, bowl&#8221; (L&amp;N 6.151). </p>
