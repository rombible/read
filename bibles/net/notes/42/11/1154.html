<A NAME="1154"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=1703><b>sn</b> Most read <i>your sons</i> as a reference to Jewish exorcists (cf. &#8220;your followers,&#8221; L&amp;N 9.4; for various views see D. L. Bock, <i>Luke</i> [BECNT], 2:1077-78), but more likely this is a reference to the disciples of Jesus themselves, who are also Jewish and have been healing as well (R. J. Shirock, &#8220;Whose Exorcists are they? The Referents of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#7985; &#965;&#7985;&#959;&#8054; &#8017;&#956;&#8182;&#957;</font> at Matthew 12:27/Luke 11:19,&#8221; <i>JSNT</i> 46 [1992]: 41-51). If this is a reference to the disciples, then Jesus&#8217; point is that it is not only him, but those associated with him whose power the hearers must assess. The following reference to judging also favors this reading. </p>
