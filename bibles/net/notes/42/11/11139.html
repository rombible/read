<A NAME="11139"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">139</span><note=1788><b>sn</b> In Judaism to come into contact with the dead or what is associated with them, even <i>without knowing it</i>, makes one unclean (Num 19:11-22; Lev 21:1-3; Mishnah,<i> m. Demai</i> 2:3). To Pharisees, who would have been so sensitive about contracting ceremonial uncleanness, it would have been quite a stinging rebuke to be told they caused it.</p>
