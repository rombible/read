<A NAME="11127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">127</span><note=1776><b>sn</b> The expression <i>everything will be clean for you </i>refers to the agreement that should exist between the overt practice of one&#8217;s religious duties, such as almsgiving, and the inner condition of one&#8217;s heart, including true love for God and the poor; one is not only to wash the outside of the cup and plate, but the inside as well, since as Jesus said, God created the inside too. Religious duties are not to be performed hypocritically, i.e., for the applause and esteem of people, but rather <i>they are to be done </i>out of a deep love for God and a sensitivity to and concern for the needs of others. Then, <i>everything will be clean</i>, both hearts and lives.</p>
