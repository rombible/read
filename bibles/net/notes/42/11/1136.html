<A NAME="1136"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1685><b>sn</b> The provision of the <i>Holy Spirit</i> is probably a reference to the wisdom and guidance supplied in response to repeated requests. Some apply it to the general provision of the Spirit, but this would seem to look only at one request in a context that speaks of repeated asking. The teaching as a whole stresses not that God gives everything his children want, but that God gives the good that they need. The parallel account in Matthew (7:11) refers to <i>good things</i> where Luke mentions the <i>Holy Spirit</i>.</p>
