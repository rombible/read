<A NAME="1125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1674><b>tn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#945;&#943;&#948;&#949;&#953;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anaideia</font>) is hard to translate. It refers to a combination of ideas, a boldness that persists over time, or &#8220;audacity,&#8221; which comes close. It most likely describes the one making the request, since the unit&#8217;s teaching is an exhortation about persistence in prayer. Some translate the term &#8220;shamelessness&#8221; which is the term&#8217;s normal meaning, and apply it to the neighbor as an illustration of God responding for the sake of his honor. But the original question was posed in terms of the first man who makes the request, not of the neighbor, so the teaching underscores the action of the one making the request.</p>
