<A NAME="1138"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1687><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;a demon that was mute&#8221; should probably be understood to mean that the demon caused muteness or speechlessness in its victim, although it is sometimes taken to refer to the demon&#8217;s own inability to speak (cf. TEV, &#8220;a demon that could not talk&#8221;).</p>
