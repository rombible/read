<A NAME="121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1819><b>tn</b> The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#959;&#7991;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">en Jois</font>) can be translated &#8220;meanwhile.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1821><b>tn</b> According to L&amp;N 27.59, &#8220;to pay attention to, to keep on the lookout for, to be alert for, to be on your guard against.&#8221; This is another Lukan present imperative calling for constant vigilance.</p>
<A NAME="124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1822><b>sn</b> See the note on <i>Pharisees</i> in 5:17.</p>

<A NAME="127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1825><b>sn</b> I.e., <i>be revealed </i>by God. The passive voice verbs here (&#8220;be revealed,&#8221; be made known&#8221;) see the revelation as coming from God. The text is both a warning about bad things being revealed and an encouragement that good things will be made known, though the stress with the images of darkness and what is hidden in vv. 2-3 is on the attempt to conceal.</p>
<A NAME="128"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1826><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;because.&#8221; Understanding this verse as a result of v. 2 is a slightly better reading of the context. Knowing what is coming should impact our behavior now.</p>
<A NAME="129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1827><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;spoken in the ear,&#8221; an idiom. The contemporary expression is &#8220;whispered.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1828><b>sn</b> The term translated <i>private rooms</i> refers to the inner room of a house, normally without any windows opening outside, the most private location possible (BDAG 988 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#945;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957;</font> 2).</p>
<A NAME="1211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1829><b>tn</b> The expression &#8220;proclaimed from the housetops&#8221; is an idiom for proclaiming something publicly (L&amp;N 7.51). Roofs of many first century Jewish houses in Judea and Galilee were flat and had access either from outside or from within the house. Something shouted from atop a house would be heard by everyone in the street below.</p>
<A NAME="1212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1830><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> (<font face="Greektl">de</font>) has not been translated.</p>
<A NAME="1213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1831><b>sn</b> Judaism had a similar exhortation in 4 Macc 13:14-15.</p>
<A NAME="1214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1832><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;will show,&#8221; but in this reflective context such a demonstration is a warning or exhortation.</p>
<A NAME="1215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1833><b>sn</b> The actual performer of the killing is not here specified. It could be understood to be God (so NASB, NRSV) but it could simply emphasize that, after a killing has taken place, it is God who casts the person into hell.</p>
<A NAME="1216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1834><b>tn</b> The direct object (&#8220;you&#8221;) is understood.</p>
<A NAME="1217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1835><b>sn</b> The word translated <i>hell</i> is &#8220;Gehenna&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#941;&#949;&#957;&#957;&#945;</font>, <font face="Greektl">geenna</font>), a Greek transliteration of the Hebrew words <i>ge hinnom</i> (&#8220;Valley of Hinnom&#8221;). This was the valley along the south side of Jerusalem. In OT times it was used for human sacrifices to the pagan god Molech (cf. Jer 7:31; 19:5-6; 32:35), and it came to be used as a place where human excrement and rubbish were disposed of and burned. In the intertestamental period, it came to be used symbolically as the place of divine punishment (cf. <i>1 En.</i> 27:2, 90:26; <i>4 Ezra</i> 7:36).</p>
<A NAME="1218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1836><b>sn</b> The <i>pennies</i> refer to the assarion, a small Roman copper coin. One of them was worth one sixteenth of a denarius or less than a half hour&#8217;s average wage. <i>Sparrows</i> were the cheapest thing sold in the market. God knows about even the most financially insignificant things; see Isa 49:15.</p>
<A NAME="1219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1837><b>sn</b> <i>Do not be afraid. </i>One should respect and show reverence to God (v. 5), but need not fear his tender care.</p>

<A NAME="1222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1840><b>tn</b> Although this is a generic reference and includes both males and females, in this context &#8220;men&#8221; has been retained because of the wordplay with the Son of Man and the contrast with the angels. The same is true of the occurrence of &#8220;men&#8221; in v. 9.</p>
<A NAME="1223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1841><b>sn</b> This acknowledgment will take place at the judgment. Of course, the <i>Son of Man</i> is a reference to Jesus as it has been throughout the Gospel. On Jesus and judgment, see 22:69; Acts 10:42-43; 17:31.</p>
<A NAME="1224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1842><b>sn</b> Blasphemy <i>against the Holy Spirit</i> probably refers to a total rejection of the testimony that the Spirit gives to Jesus and the plan of God. This is not so much a sin of the moment as of one&#8217;s entire life, an obstinate rejection of God&#8217;s message and testimony. Cf. Matt 12:31-32 and Mark 3:28-30.</p>
<A NAME="1225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1843><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;it will not be forgiven the person who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1844><b>sn</b> The saying looks at persecution both from a Jewish context as the mention of <i>synagogues</i> suggests, and from a Gentile one as the reference to <i>the rulers and the authorities </i>suggests.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> See the note on <i>synagogues</i> in 4:15.</p>
<A NAME="1227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1845><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;and the,&#8221; but <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has not been translated since English normally uses a coordinating conjunction only between the last two elements in a series of three or more.</p>

Externally, the shorter reading is superior. Internally, the pronoun looks to be a scribal clarification.

The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969;&#955;&#953;&#954;&#943;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jhlikia</font>) is ambiguous in the same way as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#8134;&#967;&#965;&#962;</font>. Most scholars take the term to describe age or length of life here, although a few refer it to bodily stature (see BDAG 435-36 s.v. 1.a for discussion). Worry about length of life seems a more natural figure than worry about height. However, the point either way is clear: Worrying adds nothing to life span or height.</p>
