<A NAME="18102"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">102</span><note=2595><b>sn</b> This failure of the Twelve to <i>grasp what Jesus meant</i> probably does not mean that they did not understand linguistically what Jesus said, but that they could not comprehend how this could happen to him, if he was really God&#8217;s agent. The saying being <i>hidden</i> probably refers to God&#8217;s sovereign timing.</p>
