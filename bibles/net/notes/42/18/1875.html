<A NAME="1875"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">75</span><note=2568><b>sn</b> The<i> eye of a needle</i> refers to a sewing needle, one of the smallest items one might deal with on a regular basis, in contrast to the biggest animal of the region. (The gate in Jerusalem known as &#8220;The Needle&#8217;s Eye&#8221; was built during the middle ages and was not in existence in Jesus&#8217; day.) Jesus is saying rhetorically that this is impossible, unless God (v. 27) intervenes.</p>
