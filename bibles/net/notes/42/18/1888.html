<A NAME="1888"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">88</span><note=2581><b>sn</b> Note that Luke (see also Matt 19:29; Mark 10:30; Luke 10:25) portrays <i>eternal life</i> as something one receives <i>in the age to come</i>, unlike John, who emphasizes the possibility of receiving eternal life in the present (John 5:24).</p>
