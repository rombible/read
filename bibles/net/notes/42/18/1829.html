<A NAME="1829"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2522><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;stood by himself and prayed like this.&#8221; The prepositional phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#7953;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#972;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pros eauton</font>, &#8220;to/about himself&#8221;) could go with either the aorist participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#964;&#945;&#952;&#949;&#943;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">staqeis</font>, &#8220;stood&#8221;) or with the imperfect verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#951;&#973;&#967;&#949;&#964;&#959;</font> (<font face="Greektl">proshuceto</font>, &#8220;he prayed&#8221;). If taken with the participle, then the meaning would seem at first glance to be: &#8220;stood &#8216;by himself&#8217;,&#8221; or &#8220;stood &#8216;alone&#8217;.&#8221; Now it is true that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#972;&#962;</font> can mean &#8220;by&#8221; or &#8220;with&#8221; when used with intransitive verbs such as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7989;&#963;&#964;&#951;&#956;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">{isthmi</font>, &#8220;I stand&#8221;; cf. BDAG 874 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#972;&#962;</font> 2.a), but <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#7953;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#972;&#957;</font> together never means &#8220;by himself&#8221; or &#8220;alone&#8221; in biblical Greek. On the other hand, if <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#7953;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#972;&#957;</font> is taken with the verb, then two different nuances emerge, both of which highlight in different ways the principal point Jesus seems to be making about the arrogance of this religious leader: (1) &#8220;prayed <i>to</i> himself,&#8221; but not necessarily silently, or (2) &#8220;prayed <i>about</i> himself,&#8221; with the connotation that he prayed out loud, for all to hear. Since his prayer is really a review of his moral résumé, directed both at advertising his own righteousness and exposing the perversion of the tax collector, whom he actually mentions in his prayer, the latter option seems preferable. If this is the case, then the Pharisee&#8217;s mention of God is really nothing more than a formality.</p>
