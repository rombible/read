<A NAME="1822"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2515><b>tn</b> Some argue this should be translated &#8220;suddenly.&#8221; When vindication comes it will be quick. But the more natural meaning is &#8220;soon.&#8221; God will not forget his elect and will respond to them. It may be that this verse has a prophetic perspective. In light of the eternity that comes, vindication is soon.</p>
