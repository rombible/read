<A NAME="2223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2986><b>sn</b> Generally <i>the feast of Unleavened Bread</i> would refer to Nisan 15 (Friday), but the following reference to the sacrifice of the <i>Passover</i> lamb indicates that Nisan 14 (Thursday) was what Luke had in mind (Nisan = March 27 to April 25). The celebration of the Feast of Unleavened Bread lasted eight days, beginning with the Passover meal. The celebrations were so close together that at times the names of both were used interchangeably.</p>
<A NAME="2224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2987><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Jesus) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2988><b>sn</b> This required getting a suitable lamb and finding lodging in Jerusalem where the meal could be eaten. The population of the city swelled during the feast, so lodging could be difficult to find. The <i>Passover</i> was celebrated each year in commemoration of the Israelites&#8217; deliverance from Egypt; thus it was a feast celebrating redemption (see Exod 12). The Passover lamb was roasted and eaten after sunset in a family group of at least ten people (<i>m. Pesahim </i>7.13). People ate the meal while reclining (see the note on <i>table</i> in 22:14). It included, besides the lamb, unleavened bread and bitter herbs as a reminder of Israel&#8217;s bitter affliction at the hands of the Egyptians. Four cups of wine mixed with water were also used for the meal. For a further description of the meal and the significance of the wine cups, see E. Ferguson, <i>Backgrounds of Early Christianity, </i>523-24.</p>

<A NAME="2240"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=3003><b>tn</b> This phrase parallels a Hebrew infinitive absolute and serves to underline Jesus&#8217; enthusiasm for holding this meal (BDF §198.6).</p>
<A NAME="2241"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=3004><b>tn</b> Although the word &#8220;again&#8221; is not in the Greek text, it is supplied to indicate that Jesus did indeed partake of this Passover meal, as statements in v. 18 suggest (&#8220;from now on&#8221;). For more complete discussion see D. L. Bock, <i>Luke</i> (BECNT), 2:1720.</p>
<A NAME="2242"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=3005><b>sn</b> Jesus looked to a celebration in the kingdom to come when the Passover <i>is fulfilled</i>. This reference could well suggest that some type of commemorative sacrifice and meal will be celebrated then, as the antecedent is the Passover sacrifice. The reference is not to the Lord&#8217;s supper as some argue, but the Passover.</p>
<A NAME="2243"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=3006><b>sn</b> The<i> kingdom of God </i>here refers to the kingdom in all its power. See Luke 17:20-37.</p>

<A NAME="2245"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=3008><b>sn</b> <i>Then he took a cup. </i>Only Luke mentions two cups at this meal; the other synoptic gospels (Matt, Mark) mention only one. This is the first of the two. It probably refers to the first cup in the traditional Passover meal, which today has four cups (although it is debated whether the fourth cup was used in the 1st century).</p>
<A NAME="2246"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=3009><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the produce&#8221; (&#8220;the produce of the vine&#8221; is a figurative expression for wine).</p>
<A NAME="2247"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=3010><b>sn</b> <i>Until the kingdom of God comes</i> is a reference to the kingdom in all its power. See Luke 17:20-37. Jesus awaits celebration with the arrival of full kingdom blessing.</p>
<A NAME="2248"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=3011><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;then&#8221; to indicate the implied sequence of events within the narrative.</p>
<A NAME="2249"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=3012><b>tc</b> Some important Western <sc>mss (D it) lack the words from this point to the end of v. 20. However, the authenticity of these verses is very likely. The inclusion of the second cup is the harder reading, since it differs from Matt 26:26-29 and Mark 14:22-25, and it has much better ms support. It is thus easier to explain the shorter reading as a scribal accident or misunderstanding. Further discussion of this complicated problem (the most difficult in Luke) can be found in <i>TCGNT</i> 148-50.</p>
<A NAME="2250"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=3013><b>sn</b> The language of the phrase <i>given for you</i> alludes to Christ&#8217;s death in our place. It is a powerful substitutionary image of what he did for us.</p>
<A NAME="2251"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=3014><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;he took&#8221; are not in the Greek text at this point, but are an understood repetition from v. 19.</p>
<A NAME="2252"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=3015><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;after they had eaten&#8221; translates the temporal infinitive construction <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#949;&#964;&#8048; &#964;&#8056; &#948;&#949;&#953;&#960;&#957;&#8134;&#963;&#945;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">meta to deipnhsai</font>), where the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#949;&#953;&#960;&#957;&#941;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">deipnew</font>) means &#8220;to eat a meal&#8221; or &#8220;to have a meal.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2253"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=3016><b>sn</b> Jesus&#8217; death established the forgiveness promised in the <i>new covenant</i> of Jer 31:31. Jesus is reinterpreting the symbolism of the Passover meal, indicating the presence of a new era.</p>
<A NAME="2254"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=3017><b>sn</b> <i>The one who betrays me. </i>Jesus knows about Judas and what he has done.</p>
<A NAME="2255"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=3018><b>sn</b> The point of Jesus&#8217; comment here is not to identify the specific individual per se, but to indicate that it is one who was close to him &#8211; somebody whom no one would suspect. His comment serves to heighten the treachery of Judas&#8217; betrayal.</p>
<A NAME="2256"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=3019><b>sn</b> Jesus&#8217; death <i>has been determined</i> as a part of God&#8217;s plan (Acts 2:22-24).</p>

However, a number of <sc>mss mark the text with an asterisk or obelisk, indicating the scribe&#8217;s assessment of the verses as inauthentic. At the same time, these verses generally fit Luke&#8217;s style. Arguments can be given on both sides about whether scribes would tend to include or omit such comments about Jesus&#8217; humanity and an angel&#8217;s help. But even if the verses are not <i>literarily </i>authentic, they are probably <i>historically </i>authentic. This is due to the fact that this text was well known in several different locales from a very early period. Since there are no synoptic parallels to this account and since there is no obvious reason for adding these words here, it is very likely that such verses recount a part of the actual suffering of our Lord. Nevertheless, because of the serious doubts as to these verses&#8217; authenticity, they have been put in brackets. For an important discussion of this problem, see B. D. Ehrman and M. A.

In the NT it occurs 15 times: 3 times as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8165;&#8134;&#956;&#945; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#954;&#965;&#961;&#943;&#959;&#965;</font> (<font face="Greektl">rJhma tou kuriou</font>; here and in Acts 11:16, 1 Pet 1:25) and 12 times as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#954;&#965;&#961;&#943;&#959;&#965;</font> (<font face="Greektl">logo&quot; tou kuriou</font>; Acts 8:25; 13:44, 48, 49; 15:35, 36; 16:32; 19:10, 20; 1 Thess 1:8, 4:15; 2 Thess 3:1). As in the OT, this phrase focuses on the prophetic nature and divine origin of what has been said. Because of its technical nature the expression has been retained in the translation in preference to a smoother rendering like &#8220;remembered what the Lord had said&#8221; (cf. TEV, NLT).</p>
