<A NAME="23124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">124</span><note=3268><b>sn</b> Joseph <i>went to Pilate and</i> <i>asked for the body</i> because he sought to give Jesus an honorable burial. This was indeed a bold move on the part of Joseph of Arimathea, for it clearly and openly identified him with a man who had just been condemned and executed, namely, Jesus. His faith is exemplary, especially for someone who was a member of the council that handed Jesus over for crucifixion (cf. Mark 15:43).</p>
