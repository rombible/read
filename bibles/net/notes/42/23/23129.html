<A NAME="23129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">129</span><note=3273><b>tc</b> Codex Bezae (D), with some support from 070, one Itala ms, and the Sahidic version, adds the words, &#8220;And after he [Jesus] was laid [in the tomb], he [Joseph of Arimathea] put a stone over the tomb which scarcely twenty men could roll.&#8221; Although this addition is certainly not part of the original text of Luke, it does show how interested the early scribes were in the details of the burial and may even reflect a very primitive tradition. Matt 27:60 and Mark 15:46 record the positioning of a large stone at the door of the tomb.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;laid to rest.&#8221;</p>
