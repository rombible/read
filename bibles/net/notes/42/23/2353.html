Roman citizens could not normally undergo it. It was reserved for the worst crimes, like treason and evasion of due process in a capital case. The Roman historian Cicero called it &#8220;a cruel and disgusting penalty&#8221; (<i>Against Verres</i> 2.5.63-66 §§163-70); Josephus (<i>J. W. </i>7.6.4 [7.203]) called it the worst of deaths.</p>
