<A NAME="2345"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=3189><b>tc</b> Many of the best <sc>mss, as well as some others (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>75</sup> A B K L T 070 1241 <i>pc</i> sa), lack <b>23:17</b> &#8220;(Now he was obligated to release one individual for them at the feast.)&#8221; This verse appears to be a parenthetical note explaining the custom of releasing someone on amnesty at the feast. It appears in two different locations with variations in wording, which makes it look like a scribal addition. It is included in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> (D following v. 19) W <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13</sup> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat. The verse appears to be an explanatory gloss based on Matt 27:15 and Mark 15:6, not original in Luke. The present translation follows NA<sup>27</sup> in omitting the verse number, a procedure also followed by a number of other modern translations.</p>
