This alternative thus looks secondary because it is a more common word and less likely to be misunderstood as referring to a solar eclipse. That it appears in later witnesses rather than the earliest ones adds confirmatory testimony to its inauthentic character.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This imagery has parallels to the Day of the Lord: Joel 2:10; Amos 8:9; Zeph 1:15. Some students of the NT see in Luke&#8217;s statement <i>the sun&#8217;s light failed</i> (<i>eklipontos</i>) an obvious blunder in his otherwise meticulous historical accuracy. The reason for claiming such an error on the author&#8217;s part is due to an understanding of the verb as indicating a solar <i>eclipse</i> when such would be an astronomical impossibility during a full moon. There are generally two ways to resolve this difficulty: (a) adopt a different reading (&#8220;the sun was darkened&#8221;) that smoothes over the problem (discussed in the <b>tc</b> problem above), or (b) understand the verb <i>eklipontos</i> in a general way (such as &#8220;the sun&#8217;s light <i>failed</i>&#8221;) rather than as a technical term, &#8220;the sun was <i>eclipsed</i>.&#8221; The problem with the first solution is that it is too convenient, for the Christian scribes who, over the centuries, copied Luke&#8217;s Gospel would have thought the same thing. That is, they too would have sensed a problem in the wording and felt that some earlier scribe had incorrectly written down what Luke penned. The fact that the reading &#8220;was darkened&#8221; shows up in the later and generally inferior witnesses does not bolster one&#8217;s confidence that this is the right solution. But second solution, if taken to its logical conclusion, proves too much for it would nullify the argument against the first solution: If the term did not refer to an eclipse, then why would scribes feel compelled to change it to a more general term? The solution to the problem is that <i>ekleipo</i> did in fact sometimes refer to an eclipse, but it did not always do so. (BDAG 306 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954;&#955;&#949;&#943;&#960;&#969;</font> notes that the verb is used in Hellenistic Greek &#8220;Of the sun <i>cease to shine</i>.&#8221; In MM it is argued that &#8220;it seems more than doubtful that in Lk 23<sup>45</sup> any reference is intended to an <i>eclipse</i>. To find such a reference is to involve the Evangelist in a needless blunder, as an <i>eclipse</i> is impossible at full moon, and to run counter to his general usage of the verb = &#8216;fail&#8217;&#8230;&#8221; [p. 195]. They enlist Luke 16:9; 22:32; and Heb 1:12 for the general meaning &#8220;fail,&#8221; and further cite several contemporaneous examples from papyri of this meaning [195-96]) Thus, the very fact that the verb <i>can</i> refer to an eclipse would be a sufficient basis for later scribes altering the text out of pious motives; conversely, the very fact that the verb <i>does not always</i> refer to an eclipse and, in fact, does not normally do so, is enough of a basis to exonerate Luke of wholly uncharacteristic carelessness.</p>
