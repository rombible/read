<A NAME="23104"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">104</span><note=3248><b>sn</b> In the NT, <i>paradise</i> is mentioned three times. Here it refers to the abode of the righteous dead. In Rev 2:7 it refers to the restoration of Edenic paradise predicted in Isa 51:3 and Ezek 36:35. In 2 Cor 12:4 it probably refers to the &#8220;third heaven&#8221; (2 Cor 12:2) as the place where God dwells.</p>
