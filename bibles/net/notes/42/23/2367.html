<A NAME="2367"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=3211><b>sn</b> The background of these <i>women</i> is disputed. Are they &#8220;official&#8221; mourners of Jesus&#8217; death, appointed by custom to mourn death? If so, the mourning here would be more <i>pro forma</i>. However, the text seems to treat the mourning as sincere, so their tears and lamenting would have been genuine. </p>
