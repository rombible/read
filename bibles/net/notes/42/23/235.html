<A NAME="235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=3149><b>sn</b> <i>They began to accuse him. </i>There were three charges: (1) disturbing Jewish peace; (2) fomenting rebellion through advocating not paying taxes (a lie &#8211; 20:20-26); and (3) claiming to be a political threat to Rome, by claiming to be a king, an allusion to Jesus&#8217; messianic claims. The second and third charges were a direct challenge to Roman authority. Pilate would be forced to do something about them.</p>
