<A NAME="2399"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">99</span><note=3243><b>sn</b> <i>Jesus, remember me</i> is a statement of faith from the cross, as Jesus saves another even while he himself is dying. This man&#8217;s faith had shown itself when he rebuked the other thief. He hoped to be with Jesus sometime in the future in the kingdom.</p>
