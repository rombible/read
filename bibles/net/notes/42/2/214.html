<A NAME="214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=259><b>sn</b> Luke&#8217;s use of the term &#8220;house&#8221; probably alludes to the original promise made to David outlined in the Nathan oracle of 2 Sam 7:12-16, especially in light of earlier connections between Jesus and David made in Luke 1:32. Further, the mention of Bethlehem reminds one of the promise of Mic 5:2, namely, that a great king would emerge from Bethlehem to rule over God&#8217;s people.</p>
