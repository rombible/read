<A NAME="217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=262><b>tn</b> Traditionally, &#8220;Mary, his betrothed.&#8221; Although often rendered in contemporary English as &#8220;Mary, who was engaged to him,&#8221; this may give the modern reader a wrong impression, since Jewish marriages in this period were typically arranged marriages. The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#956;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#965;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#8131;</font> (<font face="Greektl">emnhsteumenh</font>) may suggest that the marriage is not yet consummated, not necessarily that they are not currently married. Some <sc>mss read &#8220;the betrothed to him wife&#8221;; others, simply &#8220;his wife.&#8221; These readings, though probably not original, may give the right sense.</p>
