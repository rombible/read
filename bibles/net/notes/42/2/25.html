<A NAME="25"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=250><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;that all the empire should be registered for taxes.&#8221; The passive infinitive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#947;&#961;&#940;&#966;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">apografesqai</font>) has been rendered as an active in the translation to improve the English style. The verb is regarded as a technical term for official registration in tax lists (BDAG 108 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#947;&#961;&#940;&#966;&#969;</font> a).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This census (<i>a decree&#8230;to register all the empire</i>) is one of the more disputed historical remarks in Luke. Josephus (<i>Ant.</i> 18.1.1 [18.1-2]) only mentions a census in <sc>a.d. 6, too late for this setting. Such a census would have been a massive undertaking; it could have started under one ruler and emerged under another, to whose name it became attached. This is one possibility to explain the data. Another is that Quirinius, who became governor in Syria for the later census, may have been merely an administrator for this census. See also Luke 2:2.</p>
