<A NAME="2105"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">105</span><note=350><b>sn</b> <i>A sword </i>refers to a very large, broad two-edged sword. The language is figurative, picturing great pain. Though it refers in part to the cross, it really includes the pain all of Jesus&#8217; ministry will cause, including the next event in Luke 2:41-52 and extending to the opposition he faced throughout his ministry.</p>
