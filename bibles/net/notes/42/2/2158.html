<A NAME="2158"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">158</span><note=403><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;I must be about my Father&#8217;s business&#8221; (so KJV, NKJV); <i>Grk</i> &#8220;in the [things] of my Father,&#8221; with an ellipsis. This verse involves an idiom that probably refers to the necessity of Jesus being involved in the instruction about God, given what he is doing. The most widely held view today takes this as a reference to the temple as the Father&#8217;s house. Jesus is saying that his parents should have known where he was.</p>
