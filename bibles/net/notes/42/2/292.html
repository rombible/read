<A NAME="292"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">92</span><note=337><b>tn</b> The syntax of this verse is disputed. Most read &#8220;light&#8221; and &#8220;glory&#8221; in parallelism, so Jesus is a light for revelation to the Gentiles and is glory to the people for Israel. Others see &#8220;light&#8221; (1:78-79) as a summary, while &#8220;revelation&#8221; and &#8220;glory&#8221; are parallel, so Jesus is light for all, but is revelation for the Gentiles and glory for Israel. Both readings make good sense and either could be correct, but Luke 1:78-79 and Acts 26:22-23 slightly favor this second option.</p>
