<A NAME="297"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">97</span><note=342><b>tn</b> The term refers to the amazement at what was happening as in other places in Luke 1&#8211;2 (1:63; 2:18). The participle is plural, while the finite verb used in the periphrastic construction is singular, perhaps to show a unity in the parents&#8217; response (BDF §135.1.d: Luke 8:19).</p>
