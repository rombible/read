<A NAME="2108"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">108</span><note=353><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;living with her husband for seven years from her virginity and she was a widow for eighty four years.&#8221; The chronology of the <i>eighty-four years </i>is unclear, since the final phrase could mean &#8220;she was widowed until the age of eighty-four&#8221; (so BDAG 423 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7957;&#969;&#962;</font> 1.b.<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;</font>). However, the more natural way to take the syntax is as a reference to the length of her widowhood, the subject of the clause, in which case Anna was about 105 years old (so D. L. Bock, <i>Luke </i>[BECNT], 1:251-52; I. H. Marshall, <i>Luke</i>, [NIGTC], 123-24).</p>
