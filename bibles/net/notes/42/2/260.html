<A NAME="260"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=305><b>tc</b> The translation follows most <sc>mss, including early and important ones ({<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A B L}). Some copyists, aware that the purification law applied to women only, produced <sc>mss ({76 it<sup>pt</sup> vg} [though the Latin word <i>eius </i>could be either masculine or feminine]) that read &#8220;her purification.&#8221; But the extant evidence for an unambiguous &#8220;her&#8221; is shut up to one late minuscule ({codex 76}) and a couple of patristic citations of dubious worth ({Pseudo-Athanasius} whose date is unknown, and the {<i>Catenae</i> <i>in euangelia Lucae et Joannis</i>}, edited by J. A. Cramer. The <i>Catenae</i> is a work of collected patristic sayings whose exact source is unknown [thus, it could come from a period covering hundreds of years]). A few other witnesses (D <i>pc</i> lat) read &#8220;his purification.&#8221; The KJV has &#8220;her purification,&#8221; following Beza&#8217;s Greek text (essentially a revision of Erasmus&#8217;). Erasmus did not have it in any of his five editions. Most likely Beza put in the feminine form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8134;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">auths</font>) because, recognizing that the <i>eius </i>found in several Latin <sc>mss could be read either as a masculine or a feminine, he made the contextually more satisfying choice of the feminine. Perhaps it crept into one or two late Greek witnesses via this interpretive Latin back-translation. So the evidence for the feminine singular is virtually nonexistent, while the masculine singular <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">autou</font>, &#8220;his&#8221;) was a clear scribal blunder. There can be no doubt that &#8220;<i>their</i> purification&#8221; is the authentic reading.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;when the days of their purification were completed.&#8221; In addition to the textual problem concerning the plural pronoun (which apparently includes Joseph in the process) there is also a question whether the term translated &#8220;purification&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#952;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#972;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">kaqarismo&quot;</font>) refers to the time period prescribed by the Mosaic law or to the offering itself which marked the end of the time period (cf. NLT, &#8220;it was time for the purification offering&#8221;).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Exegetically the plural pronoun &#8220;their&#8221; creates a problem. It was Mary&#8217;s purification that was required by law, forty days after the birth (Lev 12:2-4). However, it is possible that Joseph shared in a need to be purified by having to help with the birth or that they also dedicated the child as a first born (Exod 13:2), which would also require a sacrifice that Joseph would bring. Luke&#8217;s point is that the parents followed the law. They were pious.</p>
