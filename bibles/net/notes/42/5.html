<A NAME="520"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=670><b>sn</b> <i>Lord</i> is a term of high respect in this context. God&#8217;s presence in the work of Jesus makes Peter recognize his authority. This vocative is common in Luke (20 times), but does not yet have its full confessional force.</p>
<A NAME="521"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=671><b>sn</b> Peter was intimidated that someone who was obviously working with divine backing was in his presence (&#8220;<i>Go away from me</i>&#8221;).

<A NAME="522"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=672><b>sn</b> An explanatory conjunction (<i>For</i>) makes it clear that Peter&#8217;s exclamation is the result of a surprising set of events. He speaks, but the others feel similarly.</p>

<A NAME="528"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=678><b>tn</b> The Greek term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anqrwpo&quot;</font>) is used here in a generic sense, referring to both men and women, thus &#8220;people.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The kind of fishing envisioned was net &#8211; not line &#8211; fishing, which involved a circular net that had heavy weights around its perimeter. The occupation of fisherman was labor-intensive. The imagery of using a lure and a line (and waiting for the fish to strike) is thus foreign to this text. Rather, the imagery of a fisherman involved much strain, long hours, and often little results. Jesus&#8217; point may have been one or more of the following: the strenuousness of evangelism, the work ethic that it required, persistence and dedication to the task (often in spite of minimal results), the infinite value of the new &#8220;catch&#8221; (viz., people), and perhaps an eschatological theme of snatching people from judgment (cf. W. L. Lane, <i>Mark</i> [NICNT], 67; D. L. Bock, <i>Luke</i> [BECNT], 1:461). If this last motif is in view, then catching people is the opposite of catching fish: The fish would be caught, killed, cooked, and eaten; people would be caught so as to remove them from eternal destruction and to give them new life. With the statement &#8220;<i>You will be catching people</i>&#8221; Jesus turns the miracle into a metaphor for mission. </p>
<A NAME="529"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=679><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;so&#8221; to indicate the result of Jesus&#8217; pronouncement.</p>
<A NAME="530"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=680><b>sn</b> The expression <i>left everything and followed him</i> pictures discipleship, which means that to learn from Jesus is to follow him as the guiding priority of one&#8217;s life.</p>
<A NAME="531"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=681><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And it happened that while.&#8221; The introductory phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#947;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#959;</font> (<font face="Greektl">egeneto</font>, &#8220;it happened that&#8221;), common in Luke (69 times) and Acts (54 times), is redundant in contemporary English and has not been translated.</p>

<A NAME="535"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=685><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;full of leprosy&#8221; (an idiom for a severe condition).</p>
<A NAME="536"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=686><b>sn</b> The ancient term for <i>leprosy</i> covers a wider array of conditions than what is called leprosy today. A leper was totally ostracized from society until he was declared cured (Lev 13:45-46).</p>
<A NAME="537"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=687><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And seeing.&#8221; Because of the difference between Greek style, which often begins sentences or clauses with &#8220;and,&#8221; and English style, which generally does not, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> (<font face="Greektl">de</font>) has not been translated here. The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7984;&#948;&#8061;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">idwn</font>) has been taken temporally.</p>
<A NAME="538"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=688><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;he fell on his face&#8221;; an idiom for bowing down with one&#8217;s face to the ground.</p>
<A NAME="539"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=689><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;and begged him, saying.&#8221; The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#969;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">legwn</font>) is redundant in English and has not been translated.</p>
<A NAME="540"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=690><b>tn</b> This is a third class condition. The report portrays the leper making no presumptions about whether Jesus will heal him or not.</p>
<A NAME="541"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=691><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;so&#8221; to indicate the response of Jesus to the man&#8217;s request.</p>
<A NAME="542"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=692><b>sn</b> <i>Touched. </i>This touch would have rendered Jesus ceremonially unclean (Lev 14:46; also Mishnah, <i>m. Nega&#8217;im</i> 3.1; 11.1; 12.1; 13.6-12).</p>

<A NAME="545"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=695><b>sn</b> The silence <i>ordered</i> by Jesus was probably meant to last only until the cleansing took place with the priests and sought to prevent Jesus&#8217; healings from becoming the central focus of the people&#8217;s reaction to him. See also 4:35, 41; 8:56 for other cases where Jesus asks for silence with reference to miracles.</p>
<A NAME="546"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=696><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;commanded him&#8221; are not in the Greek text but have been supplied for clarity. This verse moves from indirect to direct discourse. This abrupt change is very awkward, so the words have been supplied to smooth out the transition.</p>
<A NAME="547"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=697><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Going, show.&#8221; The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#949;&#955;&#952;&#8061;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">apelqwn</font>) has been translated as an attendant circumstance participle. Here the syntax also changes somewhat abruptly from indirect discourse to direct discourse.</p>
<A NAME="548"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=698><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;the offering&#8221; are not in the Greek text, but are implied. Direct objects were frequently omitted in Greek when clear from the context.</p>
<A NAME="549"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=699><b>sn</b> On the phrase <i>as Moses commanded </i>see Lev 14:1-32.</p>
<A NAME="550"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=700><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;as an indictment against them&#8221;; or &#8220;as proof to the people.&#8221; This phrase could be taken as referring to a positive witness to the priests, a negative testimony against them, or as a testimony to the community that the man had indeed been cured. In any case, the testimony shows that Jesus is healing and ministering to those in need.</p>
<A NAME="551"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=701><b>sn</b> That is, in spite of Jesus&#8217; instructions to the man to tell no one about the healing (v. 14).</p>
<A NAME="552"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=702><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;him&#8221; is not in the Greek text, but is implied. Direct objects were frequently omitted in Greek when clear from the context.</p>

The adverb &#8220;frequently&#8221; has been added in the translation to bring out what is most likely an iterative force to the imperfect. However, the imperfect might instead portray an ingressive idea: &#8220;he began to withdraw.&#8221; See <i>ExSyn</i> 542-43.</p>
<A NAME="555"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=705><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;desert.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="557"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=707><b>sn</b> <i>Pharisees </i>were members of one of the most important and influential religious and political parties of Judaism in the time of Jesus. There were more Pharisees than Sadducees (according to Josephus, <i>Ant.</i> 17.2.4 [17.42] there were more than 6,000 Pharisees at about this time). Pharisees differed with Sadducees on certain doctrines and patterns of behavior. The Pharisees were strict and zealous adherents to the laws of the OT and to numerous additional traditions such as angels and bodily resurrection.</p>
<A NAME="558"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=708><b>tn</b> That is, those who were skilled in the teaching and interpretation of the OT law. These are called &#8220;experts in the law&#8221; (<i>Grk</i> &#8220;scribes&#8221;) in v. 21.</p>

However, the reading with the singular pronoun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#972;&#957;</font>, which acts as the subject of the infinitive, is to be preferred. Externally, it has support from better <sc>mss (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B L W <i>al</i> sa). Internally, it is probable that scribes changed the singular <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#972;&#957;</font> to the plural <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#973;&#962;</font>, expecting the object of the infinitive to come at this point in the text. The singular as the harder reading accounts for the rise of the other reading.</p>

The Greek word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7984;&#948;&#959;&#973;</font> (<font face="Greektl">idou</font>) has no exact English equivalent here, but adds interest and emphasis (BDAG 468 s.v. 1), especially in conjunction with the suddenness of the stretcher-bearers&#8217; appearance.</p>

<A NAME="567"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=717><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;But finding.&#8221; The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#8017;&#961;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jeuronte&quot;</font>) has been translated as a causal adverbial participle.</p>
