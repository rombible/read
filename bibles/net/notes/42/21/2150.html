<A NAME="2150"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=2921><b>sn</b> The phrase <i>its desolation</i> is a reference to the fall of the city, which is the only antecedent present in Luke&#8217;s account. The parallels to this in Matt 24:15 and Mark 13:14 refer to the temple&#8217;s desolation, though Matthew&#8217;s allusion is clearer. They focus on the parallel events of the end, not on the short term realization in <sc>a.d. 70. The entire passage has a prophetic &#8220;two events in one&#8221; typology, where the near term destruction (<sc>a.d. 70) is like the end. So the evangelists could choose to focus on the near time realization (Luke) or on its long term fulfillment, which mirrors it (Matthew, Mark). </p>
