<A NAME="2166"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=2937><b>sn</b> An allusion to Isa 34:4. The heavens were seen as the abode of heavenly forces, so their shaking indicates distress in the spiritual realm. Although some take <i>the powers</i> as a reference to bodies in the heavens (like stars and planets, &#8220;the heavenly bodies,&#8221; NIV) this is not as likely.</p>
