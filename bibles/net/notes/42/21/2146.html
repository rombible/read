<A NAME="2146"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=2917><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;your souls,&#8221; but <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#968;&#965;&#967;&#8053;</font> (<font face="Greektl">yuch</font>) is frequently used of one&#8217;s physical life. In light of v. 16 that does not seem to be the case here. The entire phrase could be taken as an idiom meaning &#8220;you will save yourselves&#8221; (L&amp;N 21.20), or (as in v. 18) this could refer to living ultimately in the presence of God.</p>
