<A NAME="2181"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">81</span><note=2952><b>tn</b> There is debate in the textual tradition about the position of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#940;&#961;</font> (<font face="Greektl">gar</font>) and whether v. 35 looks back to v. 34 or is independent. The textual evidence does slightly favor placing <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#940;&#961;</font> after the verb and thus linking it back to v. 34. The other reading looks like Isa 24:17. However, the construction is harsh and the translation prefers for stylistic reasons to start a new English sentence here.</p>
