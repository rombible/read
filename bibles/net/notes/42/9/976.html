<A NAME="976"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">76</span><note=1381><b>sn</b> No explanation for the command <i>not to tell this to anyone</i> is given, but the central section of Luke, chapters 9-19, appears to reveal a reason. The disciples needed to understand who the Messiah really was and exactly what he would do before they were ready to proclaim Jesus as such. But they and the people had an expectation that needed some instruction to be correct. </p>
