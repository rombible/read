<A NAME="960"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=1365><b>sn</b> <i>Gave thanks </i>adds a note of gratitude to the setting. The scene is like two other later meals: Luke 22:19 and 24:30. Jesus gives thanks to God &#8220;with respect to&#8221; the provision of food. The disciples learn how Jesus is the mediator of blessing. John 6 speaks of him in this scene as picturing the &#8220;Bread of Life.&#8221;</p>
