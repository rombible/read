<A NAME="9100"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">100</span><note=1405><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the appearance of his face became different.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> In 1st century Judaism and in the NT, there was the belief that the righteous get new, glorified bodies in order to enter heaven (1 Cor 15:42-49; 2 Cor 5:1-10). This transformation means the righteous will share the glory of God. One recalls the way Moses shared the Lord&#8217;s glory after his visit to the mountain in Exod 34. So the disciples saw <i>the appearance of his face transformed</i>, and they were getting a sneak preview of the great glory that Jesus would have (only his glory is more inherent to him as one who shares in the rule of the kingdom). </p>
