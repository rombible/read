<A NAME="986"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">86</span><note=1391><b>sn</b> The point of the saying <i>whoever wants to save his life will lose it</i> is that if one comes to Jesus then rejection by many will certainly follow. If self-protection is a key motivation, then one will not respond to Jesus and will not be saved. One who is willing to risk rejection will respond and find true life.</p>
