<A NAME="994"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">94</span><note=1399><b>sn</b> The meaning of the statement that some<i> will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God</i> is clear at one level, harder at another. Jesus predicts some will experience the kingdom before they die. When does this happen? (1) An initial fulfillment is the next event, the transfiguration. (2) It is also possible in Luke&#8217;s understanding that all but Judas experience the initial fulfillment of the coming of God&#8217;s presence and rule in the work of Acts 2. In either case, the &#8220;kingdom of God&#8221; referred to here would be the initial rather than the final phase.</p>
