<A NAME="1920"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2642><b>sn</b> Being the<i> guest of a man who is a sinner</i> was a common complaint about Jesus: Luke 5:31-32; 7:37-50; 15:1-2.</p>
<A NAME="1921"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2643><b>sn</b> Zacchaeus was a penitent man who resolved on the spot to act differently in the face of Jesus&#8217; acceptance of him. In resolving to <i>give</i> half his <i>possessions </i>to the poor, Zacchaeus was not defending himself against the crowd&#8217;s charges and claiming to be righteous. Rather as a result of this meeting with Jesus, he was a changed individual. So Jesus could speak of salvation coming that day (v. 9) and of the lost being saved (v. 10).</p>
<A NAME="1922"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2644><b>tn</b> This is a first class condition in the Greek text. It virtually confesses fraud.</p>

<A NAME="1925"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2647><b>sn</b> The <i>household </i>is not a reference to the building, but to the people who lived within it (L&amp;N 10.8).</p>
<A NAME="1926"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2648><b>sn</b> Zacchaeus was personally affirmed by Jesus as a descendant (<i>son</i>) <i>of Abraham</i> and a member of God&#8217;s family.</p>
<A NAME="1927"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2649><b>sn</b> <i>The Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost</i> is Jesus&#8217; mission succinctly defined. See Luke 15:1-32.</p>

<A NAME="1935"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=2657><b>sn</b> The background to this story about the <i>nobleman</i> who <i>went</i>&#8230;<i>to receive for himself a kingdom </i>had some parallels in the area&#8217;s recent history: Archelaus was appointed ethnarch of Judea, Samaria, and Idumea in 4 <sc>b.c., but the people did not like him. Herod the Great also made a similar journey to Rome where he was crowned King of Judea in 40 <sc>b.c., although he was not able to claim his kingdom until 37 <sc>b.c.</></p>

Due to the length and complexity of the Greek sentence, a new sentence was started here in the translation by supplying the pronoun &#8220;he&#8221; as subject and the verb &#8220;wanted&#8221; to convey the idea of purpose.</p>
<A NAME="1945"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=2667><b>sn</b> The Greek verb <i>earned</i> refers to profit from engaging in commerce and trade (L&amp;N 57.195). This is an examination of stewardship.</p>

<A NAME="1951"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=2673><b>sn</b> The faithful slave received expanded responsibility (<i>authority over ten cities</i>) as a result of his faithfulness; this in turn is an exhortation to faithfulness for the reader.</p>

<A NAME="1955"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=2677><b>sn</b> Though ten were given minas, the story stops to focus on the one who did nothing with the opportunity given to him. Here is the parable&#8217;s warning about the one who does not trust the master. This figure is called &#8220;<i>another</i>,&#8221; marking him out as different than the first two.</p>
<A NAME="1956"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=2678><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;slave&#8221; is not in the Greek text, but has been supplied for stylistic reasons.</p>

<A NAME="1961"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=2683><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;man, taking out.&#8221; The Greek word can refer to withdrawing money from a bank (L&amp;N 57.218), and in this context of financial accountability that is the most probable meaning. Because of the length and complexity of the Greek sentence, a new sentence was started here in the translation by supplying the pronoun &#8220;you&#8221; as subject and translating the participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#7988;&#961;&#949;&#953;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">airei&quot;</font>) as a finite verb.</p>
<A NAME="1962"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=2684><b>tn</b> The Greek verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#943;&#952;&#951;&#956;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">tiqhmi</font>) can be used of depositing money with a banker to earn interest (L&amp;N 57.217).

<A NAME="1974"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">74</span><note=2696><b>sn</b> The one who has nothing has even what he seems to have <i>taken away</i> from him, ending up with no reward at all (see also Luke 8:18). The exact force of this is left ambiguous, but there is no comfort here for those who are pictured by the third slave as being totally unmoved by the master. Though not an outright enemy, there is no relationship to the master either. Three groups are represented in the parable: the faithful of various sorts (vv. 16, 18); the unfaithful who associate with Jesus but do not trust him (v. 21); and the enemies (v. 27).</p>
