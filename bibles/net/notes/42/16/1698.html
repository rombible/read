<A NAME="1698"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">98</span><note=2395><b>sn</b> The concluding statement of the parable, <i>they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead</i>, provides a hint that even Jesus&#8217; resurrection will not help some to respond. The message of God should be good enough. Scripture is the sign to be heeded.</p>
