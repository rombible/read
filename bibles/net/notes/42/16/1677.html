<A NAME="1677"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">77</span><note=2374><b>sn</b> The rich man had not helped <i>Lazarus</i> before, when he lay outside his gate (v. 2), but he knew him well enough to know his name. This is why the use of the name <i>Lazarus</i> in the parable is significant. (The rich man&#8217;s name, on the other hand, is not mentioned, because it is not significant for the point of the story.)</p>
