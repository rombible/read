<A NAME="1655"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=2352><b>tn</b> Many translations have &#8220;entereth violently into it&#8221; (ASV) or &#8220;is forcing his way into it&#8221; (NASB, NIV). This is not true of everyone. It is better to read the verb here as passive rather than middle, and in a softened sense of &#8220;be urged.&#8221; See Gen 33:11; Judg 13:15-16; 19:7; 2 Sam 3:25, 27 in the LXX. This fits the context well because it agrees with Jesus&#8217; attempt to persuade his opponents to respond morally. For further discussion and details, see D. L. Bock, <i>Luke</i> (BECNT), 2:1352-53.</p>
