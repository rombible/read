<A NAME="1651"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=2348><b>tn</b> There is no verb in the Greek text; one must be supplied. Some translations (NASB, NIV) supply &#8220;proclaimed&#8221; based on the parallelism with the proclamation of the kingdom. The transitional nature of this verse, however, seems to call for something more like &#8220;in effect&#8221; (NRSV) or, as used here, &#8220;in force.&#8221; Further, Greek generally can omit one of two kinds of verbs &#8211; either the equative verb or one that is <i>already</i> mentioned in the preceding context (<i>ExSyn</i> 39).</p>
