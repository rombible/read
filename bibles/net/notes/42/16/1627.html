<A NAME="1627"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2324><b>sn</b> Where this parable ends is debated: Does it conclude with v. 7, after v. 8a, after v. 8b, or after v. 9? Verse 8a looks as if it is still part of the story, with its clear reference to the manager, while 8b looks like Jesus&#8217; application, since its remarks are more general. So it is most likely the parable stops after v. 8a.</p>
