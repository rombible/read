<A NAME="1671"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=2368><b>sn</b> The Greek term <i>Hades</i> stands for the Hebrew concept of <i>Sheol</i>. It is what is called <i>hell</i> today. This is where the dead were gathered (Ps 16:10; 86:13). In the NT Hades has an additional negative force of awaiting judgment (Rev 20:13).</p>
