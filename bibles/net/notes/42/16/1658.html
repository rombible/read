<A NAME="1658"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=2355><b>sn</b> The examples of marriage and divorce show that the ethical standards of the new era are still faithful to promises made in the presence of God. To contribute to the breakup of a marriage, which involved a vow before God, is to commit <i>adultery</i>. This works whether one gets a divorce or marries a person who is divorced, thus finalizing the breakup of the marriage. Jesus&#8217; point concerns the need for fidelity and ethical integrity in the new era.</p>
