<A NAME="1631"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2328><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;unrighteous mammon.&#8221; <i>Mammon</i> is the Aramaic term for wealth or possessions. The point is not that money is inherently evil, but that it is often misused so that it is a means of evil; see 1 Tim 6:6-10, 17-19. The call is to be generous and kind in its use. Zacchaeus becomes the example of this in Luke&#8217;s Gospel (19:1-10).</p>
