In either case this was labor performed by the uneducated, so it would be an insult as a job for a manager.</p>

<A NAME="1613"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2310><b>tn</b> This is a dramatic use of the aorist and the verse is left unconnected to the previous verse by asyndeton, giving the impression of a sudden realization.</p>

<A NAME="1618"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2315><b>sn</b> A <i>measure</i> (sometimes translated &#8220;bath&#8221;) was just over 8 gallons (about 30 liters). This is a large debt &#8211; about 875 gallons (3000 liters) of olive oil, worth 1000 denarii, over three year&#8217;s pay for a daily worker.</p>
<A NAME="1619"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2316><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;He&#8221;; the referent (the manager) has been specified in the translation for clarity.

<A NAME="1620"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2317><b>sn</b> The bill was halved (<i>sit down quickly, and write fifty</i>). What was the steward doing? This is debated. 1) Did he simply lower the price? 2) Did he remove interest from the debt? 3) Did he remove his own commission? It is hard to be sure. Either of the latter two options is more likely. The goal was clear: The manager would be seen in a favorable light for bringing a deflationary trend to prices.</p>
<A NAME="1621"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2318><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;He&#8221;; the referent (the second debtor) has been specified in the translation for clarity.

<A NAME="1622"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2319><b>sn</b> The <i>hundred measures</i> here was a hundreds cors. A cor was a Hebrew dry measure for grain, flour, etc., of between 10-12 bushels (about 390 liters). This was a huge amount of wheat, representing the yield of about 100 acres, a debt of between 2500-3000 denarii.</p>
<A NAME="1623"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2320><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;He&#8221;; the referent (the manager) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1624"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2321><b>sn</b> The percentage of reduction may not be as great because of the change in material.</p>
<A NAME="1625"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2322><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And the.&#8221; Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has not been translated because of differences between Greek and English style.</p>
<A NAME="1626"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2323><b>sn</b> Is the manager <i>dishonest</i> because of what he just did? Or is it a reference to what he had done earlier, described in v. 1? This is a difficult question, but it seems unlikely that the master, having fired the man for prior dishonesty, would now commend those same actions. It would also be unusual for Jesus to make that point of the story the example. Thus it is more likely the reference to dishonesty goes back to the earliest events, while the commendation is for the cleverness of the former manager reflected in vv. 5-7.</p>
<A NAME="1627"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2324><b>sn</b> Where this parable ends is debated: Does it conclude with v. 7, after v. 8a, after v. 8b, or after v. 9? Verse 8a looks as if it is still part of the story, with its clear reference to the manager, while 8b looks like Jesus&#8217; application, since its remarks are more general. So it is most likely the parable stops after v. 8a.</p>
<A NAME="1628"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2325><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;sons&#8221; (an idiom).</p>

<A NAME="1630"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2327><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;sons.&#8221; Here the phrase &#8220;sons of light&#8221; is a reference to the righteous. The point is that those of the world often think ahead about consequences better than the righteous do.</p>
<A NAME="1631"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2328><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;unrighteous mammon.&#8221; <i>Mammon</i> is the Aramaic term for wealth or possessions. The point is not that money is inherently evil, but that it is often misused so that it is a means of evil; see 1 Tim 6:6-10, 17-19. The call is to be generous and kind in its use. Zacchaeus becomes the example of this in Luke&#8217;s Gospel (19:1-10).</p>
<A NAME="1632"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2329><b>sn</b> The passive refers to the welcome of heaven.</p>

<A NAME="1634"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=2331><b>sn</b> The point of the statement<i> faithful in a very little </i>is that character is shown in how little things are treated.</p>

<A NAME="1637"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=2334><b>sn</b> <i>Entrust you with the true riches</i> is a reference to future service for God. The idea is like 1 Cor 9:11, except there the imagery is reversed.</p>
<A NAME="1638"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=2335><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;faithful.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="1641"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=2338><b>sn</b> The contrast between <i>hate</i> and <i>love</i> here is rhetorical. The point is that one will choose the favorite if a choice has to be made.</p>
<A NAME="1642"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=2339><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;and treat [the other] with contempt.&#8221;</p>

The point is not that money is inherently evil, but that it is often misused so that it is a means of evil; see 1 Tim 6:6-10, 17-19. God must be first, not money or possessions.</p>
<A NAME="1644"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=2341><b>sn</b> See the note on <i>Pharisees</i> in 5:17.</p>

<A NAME="1646"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=2343><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;but&#8221; to indicate the contrast present in this context.</p>

<A NAME="1648"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=2345><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;before men.&#8221; The contrast is between outward appearance (&#8220;in people&#8217;s eyes&#8221;) and inward reality (&#8220;God knows your hearts&#8221;). Here the Greek term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anqrwpo&quot;</font>) is used twice in a generic sense, referring to both men and women, but &#8220;men&#8221; has been retained in the text to provide a strong verbal contrast with &#8220;God&#8221; in the second half of the verse.</p>
<A NAME="1649"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=2346><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;exalted.&#8221; This refers to the pride that often comes with money and position.</p>

<A NAME="1651"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=2348><b>tn</b> There is no verb in the Greek text; one must be supplied. Some translations (NASB, NIV) supply &#8220;proclaimed&#8221; based on the parallelism with the proclamation of the kingdom. The transitional nature of this verse, however, seems to call for something more like &#8220;in effect&#8221; (NRSV) or, as used here, &#8220;in force.&#8221; Further, Greek generally can omit one of two kinds of verbs &#8211; either the equative verb or one that is <i>already</i> mentioned in the preceding context (<i>ExSyn</i> 39).</p>
<A NAME="1652"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=2349><b>sn</b> <i>John</i> refers to John the Baptist.</p>
<A NAME="1653"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=2350><b>sn</b> <i>Until John; since then. </i>This verse indicates a shift in era, from law to kingdom.</p>
<A NAME="1654"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=2351><b>sn</b> The<i> kingdom of God</i> is a major theme of Jesus. It is a realm in which Jesus rules and to which those who trust him belong. See Luke 6:20; 11:20; 17:20-21.</p>
<A NAME="1655"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=2352><b>tn</b> Many translations have &#8220;entereth violently into it&#8221; (ASV) or &#8220;is forcing his way into it&#8221; (NASB, NIV). This is not true of everyone. It is better to read the verb here as passive rather than middle, and in a softened sense of &#8220;be urged.&#8221; See Gen 33:11; Judg 13:15-16; 19:7; 2 Sam 3:25, 27 in the LXX. This fits the context well because it agrees with Jesus&#8217; attempt to persuade his opponents to respond morally. For further discussion and details, see D. L. Bock, <i>Luke</i> (BECNT), 2:1352-53.</p>
<A NAME="1656"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=2353><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;one small part of a letter&#8221; (L&amp;N 33.37).</p>

<A NAME="1658"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=2355><b>sn</b> The examples of marriage and divorce show that the ethical standards of the new era are still faithful to promises made in the presence of God. To contribute to the breakup of a marriage, which involved a vow before God, is to commit <i>adultery</i>. This works whether one gets a divorce or marries a person who is divorced, thus finalizing the breakup of the marriage. Jesus&#8217; point concerns the need for fidelity and ethical integrity in the new era.</p>
<A NAME="1659"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=2356><b>sn</b> <i>Purple</i> describes a fine, expensive dye used on luxurious clothing, and by metonymy, refers to clothing colored with that dye. It pictures someone of great wealth.</p>
<A NAME="1660"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=2357><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;celebrated with ostentation&#8221; (L&amp;N 88.255), that is, with showing off. Here was the original conspicuous consumer.</p>
<A NAME="1661"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=2358><b>tn</b> The passive verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#946;&#941;&#946;&#955;&#951;&#964;&#959;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ebeblhto</font>) does not indicate how Lazarus got there.

<A NAME="1662"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=2359><b>sn</b> This is the one time in all the gospels that a figure in a parable is mentioned by name. It will become important later in the account.</p>

<A NAME="1666"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=2363><b>sn</b> When <i>the dogs came and licked his sores </i>it meant that he was unclean. See the negative image of Rev 22:15 that draws on this picture.</p>

<A NAME="1668"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">68</span><note=2365><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;to Abraham&#8217;s bosom.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;carried by the angels to Abraham&#8217;s bosom&#8221; describes being gathered to the fathers and is a way to refer to heaven (Gen 15:15; 47:30; Deut 31:16).</p>

<A NAME="1670"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">70</span><note=2367><b>sn</b> The shorter description suggests a different fate, which is confirmed in the following verses.</p>
<A NAME="1671"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=2368><b>sn</b> The Greek term <i>Hades</i> stands for the Hebrew concept of <i>Sheol</i>. It is what is called <i>hell</i> today. This is where the dead were gathered (Ps 16:10; 86:13). In the NT Hades has an additional negative force of awaiting judgment (Rev 20:13).</p>
<A NAME="1672"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">72</span><note=2369><b>sn</b> Hades is a place of <i>torment</i>, especially as one knows that he is separated from God.</p>

<A NAME="1677"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">77</span><note=2374><b>sn</b> The rich man had not helped <i>Lazarus</i> before, when he lay outside his gate (v. 2), but he knew him well enough to know his name. This is why the use of the name <i>Lazarus</i> in the parable is significant. (The rich man&#8217;s name, on the other hand, is not mentioned, because it is not significant for the point of the story.)</p>
<A NAME="1678"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">78</span><note=2375><b>sn</b> The dipping of the <i>tip of his finger in water</i> is evocative of thirst.
