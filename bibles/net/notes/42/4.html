Three samples of the end of the testing are given in the following verses.</p>

<A NAME="48"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=505><b>sn</b> The reference to Jesus <i>eating nothing</i> could well be an idiom meaning that he ate only what the desert provided; see Exod 34:28.

The noun is always used in the NT in eschatological contexts; the verb is often so used (cf. Matt 13:39, 40; 24:3; 28:20; Mark 13:4; Rom 9:28; Heb 8:8; 9:26). The idea here may be that the forty-day period of temptation was <i>designed</i> for a particular purpose in the life of Christ (the same verb is used in v. 13). The cognate verb <font face="Greektl">teleiow</font> is a key NT term for the completion of God&#8217;s plan: See Luke 12:50; 22:37; John 19:30; and (where it has the additional component of meaning &#8220;to perfect&#8221;) Heb 2:10; 5:8-9; 7:28.</p>

A town could establish a synagogue if there were at least ten men. In normative Judaism of the NT period, the OT scripture was read and discussed in the synagogue by the men who were present (see the Mishnah, <i>m. Megillah</i> 3-4; <i>m. Berakhot</i> 2).</p>

The equivalent Hebrew expression in the Old Testament had two basic meanings: (1) When one person was unjustly bothering another, the injured party could say &#8220;What to me and to you?&#8221; meaning, &#8220;What have I done to you that you should do this to me?&#8221; (Judg 11:12; 2 Chr 35:21; 1 Kgs 17:18). (2) When someone was asked to get involved in a matter he felt was no business of his, he could say to the one asking him, &#8220;What to me and to you?&#8221; meaning, &#8220;That is your business, how am I involved?&#8221; (2 Kgs 3:13; Hos 14:8). Option (1) implies hostility, while option (2) merely implies disengagement. BDAG suggests the following as glosses for this expression: <i>What have I to do with you? What have we in common?

John 6:15). Jesus wanted to avoid, as much as possible, any premature misunderstanding about who he was and what he was doing.
