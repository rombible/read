<A NAME="13105"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">105</span><note=2067><b>sn</b> <i>Some are last who will be first, and some are first who will be last. </i>Jesus&#8217; answer is that some who are expected to be there (many from Israel) will not be there, while others not expected to be present (from other nations) will be present. The question is not, &#8220;Will the saved be few?&#8221; (see v. 23), but &#8220;Will it be you?&#8221;</p>
