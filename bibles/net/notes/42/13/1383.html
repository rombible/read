<A NAME="1383"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">83</span><note=2045><b>tn</b> The syntactical relationship between vv. 24-25 is disputed. The question turns on whether v. 25 is connected to v. 24 or not. A lack of a clear connective makes an independent idea more likely. However, one must then determine what the beginning of the sentence connects to. Though it makes for slightly awkward English, the translation has opted to connect it to &#8220;he will answer&#8221; so that this functions, in effect, as an apodosis. One could end the sentence after &#8220;us&#8221; and begin a new sentence with &#8220;He will answer&#8221; to make simpler sentences, although the connection between the two sentences is thereby less clear. The point of the passage, however, is clear. Once the door is shut, because one failed to come in through the narrow way, it is closed permanently. The moral: Do not be too late in deciding to respond.</p>
