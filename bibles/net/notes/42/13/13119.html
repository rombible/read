<A NAME="13119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">119</span><note=2081><b>sn</b> Death in <i>Jerusalem</i> is another key theme in Luke&#8217;s material: 7:16, 34; 24:19; Acts 3:22-23. Notice that Jesus sees himself in the role of a prophet here. Jesus&#8217; statement, <i>it is impossible that a prophet should be killed outside Jerusalem</i>, is filled with irony; Jesus, traveling about in Galilee (most likely), has nothing to fear from Herod; it is his own people living in the very center of Jewish religion and worship who present the greatest danger to his life. The underlying idea is that Jerusalem, though she stands at the very heart of the worship of God, often kills the prophets God sends to her (v. 34). In the end, Herod will be much less a threat than Jerusalem.</p><p class="footnote"><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
