<A NAME="13113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">113</span><note=2075><b>sn</b> <i>That fox.</i> This is not fundamentally a figure for cleverness as in modern western culture, but could indicate (1) an insignificant person (Neh 4:3; 2 Esd 13:35 LXX); (2) a deceiver (<i>Song Rabbah</i> 2.15.1 on 2:15); or someone destructive, a destroyer (Ezek 13:4; Lam 5:18; <i>1 En.</i> 89:10, 42-49, 55). Luke&#8217;s emphasis seems to be on destructiveness, since Herod killed John the Baptist, whom Luke calls &#8220;the greatest born of women&#8221; (Luke 7:28) and later stands opposed to Jesus (Acts 4:26-28). In addition, &#8220;a person who is designated a fox is an insignificant or base person. He lacks real power and dignity, using cunning deceit to achieve his aims&#8221; (H. W. Hoehner, <i>Herod Antipas</i> [SNTSMS], 347).</p>
