<A NAME="1319"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1981><b>tc</b> &#8225; Several witnesses (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>75</sup> A L <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 070 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13</sup> 33 579 892 <i>al</i> lat co) have &#8220;therefore&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">oun</font>) here. This conjunction has the effect of strengthening the logical connection with the preceding statement but also of reducing the rhetorical power and urgency of the imperative. In light of the slightly greater internal probability of adding a conjunction to an otherwise asyndetic sentence, as well as significant external support for the omission (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B D W <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1</sup> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>), the shorter reading appears to be more likely as the original wording here. NA<sup>27</sup> puts the conjunction in brackets, indicating some doubts as to its authenticity.</p>
