<A NAME="370"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">70</span><note=485><b>tc</b> Several of the names in the list have alternate spellings in the ms tradition, but most of these are limited to a few <sc>mss. Only significant differences are considered in the notes through v. 38.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> The construction of the genealogy is consistent throughout as a genitive article (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#8166;</font>, <font face="Greektl">tou</font>) marks sonship. Unlike Matthew&#8217;s genealogy, this one runs from Jesus down. It also goes all the way to Adam, not stopping at Abraham as Matthew&#8217;s does. Jesus has come for all races of humanity. Both genealogies go through David. </p>
