<A NAME="377"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">77</span><note=492><b>tc</b> The number and order of the first few names in this verse varies greatly in the <sc>mss. The variants which are most likely to be original based upon external evidence are Amminadab, Aram (A D 33 565 [1424] <i>pm</i> lat); Amminadab, Aram, Joram (K <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#916;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 700 2542 <i>pm</i>); Adam, Admin, Arni (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>4vid</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* 1241 <i>pc</i> sa); and Amminadab, Admin, Arni (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>2</sup> L X [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#915;</font>] <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13</sup> <i>pc</i>). Deciding between these variants is quite difficult. The reading &#8220;Amminadab, Aram&#8221; is the strongest externally since it is represented by Alexandrian, Western, and Byzantine witnesses, although it is significantly weaker internally because it disrupts the artistic balance of the number of generations and their groups that three names would preserve (see <i>TCGNT</i> 113, fn. 1 for discussion). In this case, the subtle intrinsic arguments that would most likely be overlooked by scribes argues for the reading &#8220;Amminadab, Admin, Arni,&#8221; although a decision is quite difficult because of the lack of strong external support.</p>
