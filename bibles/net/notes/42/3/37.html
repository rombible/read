<A NAME="37"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=422><b>sn</b> Use of the singular <i>high priesthood</i> to mention two figures is unusual but accurate, since Annas was the key priest from <sc>a.d. 6-15 and then his relatives were chosen for many of the next several years. After two brief tenures by others, his son-in-law Caiaphas came to power and stayed there until <sc>a.d. 36.</p>
