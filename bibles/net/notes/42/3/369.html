<A NAME="369"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">69</span><note=484><b>sn</b> The parenthetical remark <i>as was supposed</i> makes it clear that Joseph was not the biological father of Jesus. But a question still remains whose genealogy this is. Mary is nowhere mentioned, so this may simply refer to the line of Joseph, who would have functioned as Jesus&#8217; legal father, much like stepchildren can have when they are adopted by a second parent.</p>
