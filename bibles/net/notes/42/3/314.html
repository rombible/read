<A NAME="314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=429><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;desert.&#8221; The syntactic position of the phrase &#8220;in the wilderness&#8221; is unclear in both Luke and the LXX. The MT favors taking it with &#8220;Prepare a way,&#8221; while the LXX takes it with &#8220;a voice shouting.&#8221; If the former, the meaning would be that such preparation should be done &#8220;in the wilderness.&#8221; If the latter, the meaning would be that the place from where John&#8217;s ministry went forth was &#8220;in the wilderness.&#8221; There are Jewish materials that support both renderings: 1QS 8:14 and 9.19-20 support the MT while certain rabbinic texts favor the LXX (see D. L. Bock, <i>Luke</i> [BECNT], 1:290-91). While it is not absolutely necessary that a call in the wilderness led to a response in the wilderness, it is not unlikely that such would be the case. Thus, in the final analysis, the net effect between the two choices may be minimal. In any case, a majority of commentators and translations take &#8220;in the wilderness&#8221; with &#8220;The voice of one shouting&#8221; (D. L. Bock; R. H. Stein, <i>Luke</i> [NAC], 129; I. H. Marshall, <i>Luke</i> [NIGTC], 136; NIV, NRSV, NKJV, NLT, NASB, REB).</p>
