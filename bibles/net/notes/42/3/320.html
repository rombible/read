<A NAME="320"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=435><b>sn</b> <i>The crowds. </i>It is interesting to trace references to &#8220;the crowd&#8221; in Luke. It is sometimes noted favorably, other times less so. The singular appears 25 times in Luke while the plural occurs 16 times. Matt 3:7 singles out the Sadducees and Pharisees here.</p>
