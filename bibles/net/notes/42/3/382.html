<A NAME="382"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">82</span><note=497><b>sn</b> The reference to <i>the son of God</i> here is not to a divine being, but to one directly formed by the hand of God. He is made in God&#8217;s image, so this phrase could be read as appositional (&#8220;Adam, that is, the son of God&#8221;). See Acts 17:28-29.</p>
