<A NAME="328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=443><b>sn</b> <i>Even now the ax is laid at the root of the trees.</i> The imagery of an &#8220;ax already laid at the root of the trees&#8221; is vivid, connoting sudden and catastrophic judgment for the unrepentant and unfruitful. The image of &#8220;fire&#8221; serves to further heighten the intensity of the judgment referred to. It is John&#8217;s way of summoning all people to return to God with all their heart and avoid his unquenchable wrath soon to be poured out. John&#8217;s language and imagery is probably ultimately drawn from the OT where Israel is referred to as a fruitless vine (Hos 10:1-2; Jer 2:21-22) and the image of an &#8220;ax&#8221; is used to indicate God&#8217;s judgment (Ps 74:5-6; Jer 46:22).</p>
