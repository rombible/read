<A NAME="326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=441><b>sn</b> <i>We have Abraham as our father. </i>John&#8217;s warning to the crowds really assumes two things: (1) A number of John&#8217;s listeners apparently believed that simply by their physical descent from Abraham, they were certain heirs of the promises made to the patriarch, and (2) God would never judge his covenant people lest he inadvertently place the fulfillment of his promises in jeopardy. In light of this, John tells these people two things: (1) they need to repent and produce fruit in keeping with repentance, for only that saves from the coming wrath, and (2) God will raise up &#8220;children for Abraham from these stones&#8221; if he wants to. Their disobedience will not threaten the realization of God&#8217;s sovereign purposes.</p>
