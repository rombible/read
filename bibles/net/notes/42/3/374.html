<A NAME="374"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">74</span><note=489><b>sn</b> The use of <i>Nathan</i> here as the son of David is different than Matthew, where Solomon is named. Nathan was David&#8217;s third son. It is not entirely clear what causes the difference. Some argue Nathan stresses a prophetic connection, but it is not clear how (through confusion with the prophet Nathan?). Others note the absence of a reference to Jeconiah later, so that here there is a difference to show the canceling out of this line. The differences appear to mean that Matthew&#8217;s line is a &#8220;royal and physical&#8221; line, while Luke has a &#8220;royal and legal&#8221; line.</p>
