<A NAME="318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=433><b>sn</b> A quotation from Isa 40:3-5. Though all the synoptic gospels use this citation from Isaiah, only Luke cites the material of vv. 5-6. His goal may well be to get to the declaration of v. 6, where all humanity (i.e., all nations) see God&#8217;s salvation (see also Luke 24:47).</p>
