<A NAME="1525"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=933><b>sn</b> The <i>crown</i> may have been made from palm spines or some other thorny plant common in Israel. In placing the crown of <i>thorns </i>on his head, the soldiers were unwittingly symbolizing God&#8217;s curse on humanity (cf. Gen 3:18) being placed on Jesus. Their purpose would have been to mock Jesus&#8217; claim to be a king; the crown of thorns would have represented the &#8220;radiant corona&#8221; portrayed on the heads of rulers on coins and other artifacts in the 1st century.</p>
