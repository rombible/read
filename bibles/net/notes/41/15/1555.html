<A NAME="1555"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=963><b>tn</b> The repetition of the phrase &#8220;three o&#8217;clock&#8221; preserves the author&#8217;s rougher, less elegant style (cf. Matt 27:45-46; Luke 23:44). Although such stylistic matters are frequently handled differently in the translation, because the issue of synoptic literary dependence is involved here, it was considered important to reflect some of the stylistic differences among the synoptics in the translation, so that the English reader can be aware of them.</p>
