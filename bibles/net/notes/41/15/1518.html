<A NAME="1518"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=926><b>tn</b> The Greek term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#966;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#955;&#972;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">fragellow</font>) refers to flogging. BDAG 1064 s.v. states, &#8220;<i>flog, scourge,</i> a punishment inflicted on slaves and provincials after a sentence of death had been pronounced on them. So in the case of Jesus before the crucifixion&#8230;Mt 27:26; Mk 15:15.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> A Roman flogging (traditionally, &#8220;scourging&#8221;) was an excruciating punishment. The victim was stripped of his clothes and bound to a post with his hands fastened above him (or sometimes he was thrown to the ground). Guards standing on either side of the victim would incessantly beat him with a whip (<i>flagellum</i>) made out of leather with pieces of lead and bone inserted into its ends. While the Jews only allowed 39 lashes, the Romans had no such limit; many people who received such a beating died as a result. See C. Schneider, <i>TDNT</i>, 4:515-19. </p>
