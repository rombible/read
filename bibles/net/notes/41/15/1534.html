<A NAME="1534"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=942><b>sn</b> Jesus was beaten severely with a whip before this (the prelude to crucifixion, known to the Romans as <i>verberatio</i>, mentioned in Matt 27:26; Mark 15:15; John 19:1), so he would have been weak from trauma and loss of blood. Apparently he was unable to bear the cross himself, so <i>Simon</i> was conscripted to help (in all probability this was only the crossbeam, called in Latin the <i>patibulum</i>, since the upright beam usually remained in the ground at the place of execution). <i>Cyrene</i> was located in North Africa where Tripoli is today. Nothing more is known about this Simon.</p>
