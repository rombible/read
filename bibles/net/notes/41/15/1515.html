<A NAME="1515"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=923><b>tc</b> Instead of &#8220;what do you want me to do&#8221; several witnesses, including the most important ones (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B C W <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#916;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13</sup> 33 892 2427 <i>pc</i>), lack <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#941;&#955;&#949;&#964;&#949;</font> (<font face="Greektl">qelete</font>, &#8220;you want&#8221;), turning the question into the more abrupt &#8220;what should I do?&#8221; Although the witnesses for the longer reading are not as significant (A D <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> 0250 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> latt sy), the reading without <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#941;&#955;&#949;&#964;&#949;</font> conforms to Matt 27:22 and thus is suspected of being a scribal emendation. The known scribal tendency to assimilate one synoptic passage to another parallel, coupled with the lack of such assimilation in <sc>mss that are otherwise known to do this most frequently (the Western and Byzantine texts), suggests that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#941;&#955;&#949;&#964;&#949;</font> is authentic. Further, Mark&#8217;s known style of being generally more verbose and redundant than Matthew&#8217;s argues that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#941;&#955;&#949;&#964;&#949;</font> is authentic here. That this is the longer reading, however, and that a good variety of witnesses omit the word, gives one pause. Perhaps the wording without <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#941;&#955;&#949;&#964;&#949;</font> would have been perceived as having greater homiletical value, motivating scribes to move in this direction. A decision is difficult, but on the whole internal evidence leads toward regarding <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#941;&#955;&#949;&#964;&#949;</font> as authentic.</p>
