<A NAME="1571"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=979><b>sn</b> Asking<i> for the body of Jesus</i> was indeed a bold move on the part of Joseph of Arimathea, for it clearly and openly identified him with a man who had just been condemned and executed, namely, Jesus. His faith is exemplary, especially for someone who was a member of the council that handed Jesus over for crucifixion (cf. Luke 23:51). He did this because he sought to give Jesus an honorable burial.</p>
