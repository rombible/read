<A NAME="1546"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=954><b>sn</b> There is rich irony in the statement of those who were passing by, &#8220;<i>Save yourself and come down from the cross!</i>&#8221; In summary, they wanted Jesus to come down from the cross and save his physical life, but it was indeed his staying on the cross and giving his physical life that led to the fact that they could experience a resurrection from death to life. There is a similar kind of irony in the statement made by the chief priests and experts in the law in 15:31. </p>
