<A NAME="1137"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=665><b>tn</b> Although the Greek subjunctive mood, formally required in a subordinate clause introduced by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">{ina</font>), is traditionally translated by an English subjunctive (e.g., &#8220;may,&#8221; so KJV, NAB, NIV, NRSV), changes in the use of the subjunctive in English now result in most readers understanding such a statement as indicating permission (&#8220;may&#8221; = &#8220;has permission to&#8221;) or as indicating uncertainty (&#8220;may&#8221; = &#8220;might&#8221; or &#8220;may or may not&#8221;). Thus a number of more recent translations render such instances by an English future tense (&#8220;will,&#8221; so TEV, CEV, NLT, NASB 1995 update). That approach has been followed here.</p>
