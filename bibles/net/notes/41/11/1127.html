<A NAME="1127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=655><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;things.&#8221; The Greek word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#954;&#949;&#8166;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">skeuos</font>) can refer to merchandise, property, goods, a vessel, or even generally &#8220;things&#8221; (but in the sense of some implement or tool). The idea here is almost certainly restricted to merchandise, rather than the more general &#8220;things,&#8221; although some suggest from the parallel with <i>m. Berakhot</i> 9.5 that Jesus was not even allowing sandals, staffs, or coin-purses to be carried through the court. The difficulty with this interpretation, however, is that it is fundamentally an appeal to Jewish oral <i>tradition</i> (something Jesus rarely sided with) as well as being indiscriminate toward all the worshipers.</p>
