<A NAME="1121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=649><b>sn</b> <i>Mark 11:12<b>-</b>14.</i> The incident of the cursing of the fig tree occurs before he enters the temple for a third time (11:27ff) and is questioned at length by the religious leaders (11:27-12:40). It appears that Mark records the incident as a portent of what is going to happen to the leadership in Jerusalem who were supposed to have borne spiritual fruit but have been found by Messiah at his coming to be barren. The fact that the nation as a whole is indicted is made explicit in chapter 13:1-37 where Jesus speaks of Jerusalem&#8217;s destruction and his second coming.</p>
