<A NAME="22"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=88><b>sn</b> <i>Capernaum </i>was a town on the northwest shore of the Sea of Galilee, 680 ft (204 m) below sea level. It was a major trade and economic center in the North Galilean region.</p><p class="footnote"><b>map</b> For location see Map1-D2; Map2-C3; Map3-B2.</p>
<A NAME="23"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=89><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;it was heard.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="24"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=90><b>tn</b> Some translations (e.g., NIV, NLT) take the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#972;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pro&quot;</font>), which indicates proximity, to mean &#8220;outside the door.&#8221; Others render it as &#8220;in front of the door&#8221; (TEV, CEV), and still others, &#8220;around the door&#8221; (NAB). There is some ambiguity inherent in the description here.</p>
<A NAME="25"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=91><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;they&#8221;; the referent (some unnamed people) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="26"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=92><b>tn</b> The redundancy in this verse is characteristic of the author&#8217;s rougher style.</p>
<A NAME="27"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=93><b>sn</b> A house in 1st century Palestine would have had a flat roof with stairs or a ladder going up. This access was often from the outside of the house.</p>
<A NAME="28"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=94><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;him&#8221;; the referent (Jesus) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="29"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=95><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And.&#8221; Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;then&#8221; to indicate the implied sequence of events within the narrative.</p>
<A NAME="210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=96><b>sn</b> The plural pronoun <i>their</i> makes it clear that Jesus was responding to the faith of the entire group, not just the paralyzed man.</p>
<A NAME="211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=97><b>sn</b> The passive voice here is a divine passive (<i>ExSyn</i> 437). It is clear that God does the forgiving.</p>

<A NAME="213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=99><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Reasoning within their hearts.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=100><b>sn</b> <i>Blaspheming </i>meant to say something that dishonored God. To claim divine prerogatives or claim to speak for God when one really does not would be such an act of offense. The remark raised directly the issue of the nature of Jesus&#8217; ministry.</p>
<A NAME="215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=101><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And.&#8221; Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;now&#8221; to indicate the shift from the thoughts of the experts in the law to Jesus&#8217; response.</p>
<A NAME="216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=102><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;they were thus reasoning within themselves.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=103><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Why are you reasoning these things in your hearts?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=104><b>sn</b> <i>Which is easier</i> is a reflective kind of question. On the one hand to declare sins are forgiven is easier, since one does not need to see it, unlike telling a paralyzed person to walk. On the other hand, it is harder, because for it to be true one must possess the authority to forgive the sin.</p>
<A NAME="219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=105><b>sn</b> Now Jesus put the two actions together. The walking of the man would be proof (<i>so that you may know</i>) that his sins were forgiven and that God had worked through Jesus (i.e., the <i>Son of Man</i>).</p>
<A NAME="220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=106><b>sn</b> The term <i>Son of Man</i>, which is a title in Greek, comes from a pictorial description in Dan 7:13 of one &#8220;like a son of man&#8221; (i.e., a human being). It is Jesus&#8217; favorite way to refer to himself. Jesus did not reveal the background of the term here, which mixes human and divine imagery as the man in Daniel rides a cloud, something only God does. He just used it. It also could be an idiom in Aramaic meaning either &#8220;some person&#8221; or &#8220;me.&#8221; So there is a little ambiguity in its use here, since its origin is not clear at this point. However, the action makes it clear that Jesus used it to refer to himself here.</p>
<A NAME="221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=107><b>sn</b> Jesus did not finish his sentence with words but with action, that is, healing the paralytic with an accompanying pronouncement to him directly.</p>
<A NAME="222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=108><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;to your house.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=109><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (the man who was healed) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=110><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;He&#8221;; the referent (Jesus) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=111><b>tn</b> While &#8220;tax office&#8221; is sometimes given as a translation for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#949;&#955;&#8061;&#957;&#953;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">telwnion</font>, so L&amp;N 57.183), this could give the modern reader a false impression of an indoor office with all its associated furnishings.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The <i>tax booth</i> was a booth located on the edge of a city or town to collect taxes for trade. There was a tax booth in Capernaum, which was on the trade route from Damascus to Galilee and the Mediterranean. The &#8220;taxes&#8221; were collected on produce and goods brought into the area for sale, and were a sort of &#8220;sales tax&#8221; paid by the seller but obviously passed on to the purchaser in the form of increased prices (L&amp;N 57.183). It was here that Jesus met Levi (also named Matthew [see Matt 9:9]) who was ultimately employed by the Romans, though perhaps more directly responsible to Herod Antipas. It was his job to collect taxes for Rome and he was thus despised by Jews who undoubtedly regarded him as a traitor.</p>
<A NAME="226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=112><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Jesus) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=113><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;As he reclined at table.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>As Jesus was having a meal. </i>1st century middle eastern meals were not eaten while sitting at a table, but while reclining on one&#8217;s side on the floor with the head closest to the low table and the feet farthest away.</p>
<A NAME="228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=114><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;his.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=115><b>sn</b> The <i>tax collectors</i> would bid to collect taxes for the Roman government and then add a surcharge, which they kept. Since tax collectors worked for Rome, they were viewed as traitors to their own people and were not well liked.</p>
<A NAME="230"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=116><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the scribes.&#8221; See the note on the phrase &#8220;experts in the law&#8221; in 1:22.</p>
<A NAME="231"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=117><b>sn</b> <i>Pharisees </i>were members of one of the most important and influential religious and political parties of Judaism in the time of Jesus. There were more Pharisees than Sadducees (according to Josephus, <i>Ant.</i> 17.2.4 [17.42] there were more than 6,000 Pharisees at about this time). Pharisees differed with Sadducees on certain doctrines and patterns of behavior. The Pharisees were strict and zealous adherents to the laws of the OT and to numerous additional traditions such as angels and bodily resurrection.</p>
<A NAME="232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=118><b>sn</b><i> </i>The issue here is inappropriate associations. Jews were very careful about personal associations and contact as a matter of ritual cleanliness. Their question borders on an accusation that Jesus is ritually unclean.</p>
<A NAME="233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=119><b>sn</b> Jesus&#8217; point is that he associates with <i>those who are sick</i> because they have the need and will respond to the offer of help. A person who is <i>healthy</i> (or who thinks mistakenly that he is) will not seek treatment.</p>
<A NAME="234"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=120><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And.&#8221; Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;now&#8221; to indicate the transition to a new topic.</p>
<A NAME="235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=121><b>sn</b> <i>John</i> refers to John the Baptist.</p>
<A NAME="236"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=122><b>sn</b> See the note on <i>Pharisees</i> in 2:16.</p>
<A NAME="237"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=123><b>sn</b> <i>John&#8217;s disciples</i> and <i>the Pharisees </i>followed typical practices with regard to fasting and prayer. Many Jews fasted regularly (Lev 16:29-34; 23:26-32; Num 29:7-11). The zealous fasted twice a week on Monday and Thursday.</p>
<A NAME="238"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=124><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And.&#8221; Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;So&#8221; to indicate that in the narrative this question happened as a result of the fasting of John&#8217;s disciples and the Pharisees. </p>
<A NAME="239"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=125><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;him&#8221;; the referent (Jesus) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="240"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=126><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And Jesus.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="241"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=127><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;sons of the wedding hall,&#8221; an idiom referring to wedding guests, or more specifically, friends of the bridegroom present at the wedding celebration (L&amp;N 11.7).</p>
<A NAME="242"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=128><b>sn</b> The expression <i>while the bridegroom is with them</i> is an allusion to messianic times (John 3:29; Isa 54:5-6; 62:4-5; 4 Ezra 2:15, 38).</p>
<A NAME="243"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=129><b>tn</b> Questions prefaced with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#8053;</font> (<font face="Greektl">mh</font>) in Greek anticipate a negative answer. This can sometimes be indicated by using a &#8220;tag&#8221; at the end in English (here the tag is &#8220;can they?&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="244"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=130><b>sn</b> The statement <i>the bridegroom will be taken from them</i> is a veiled allusion by Jesus to his death, which he did not make explicit until the incident at Caesarea Philippi in 8:27ff. (cf. 8:31; 9:31; 10:33). </p>
<A NAME="245"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=131><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;then on that day.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="246"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=132><b>sn</b> <i>Wineskins</i> were bags made of skin or leather, used for storing wine in NT times. As the new wine fermented and expanded, it would stretch the new wineskins. Putting new (unfermented) wine in old wineskins, which had already been stretched, would result in the bursting of the wineskins.</p>
<A NAME="247"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=133><b>sn</b> The meaning of the saying <i>new wine is poured into new skins</i> is that the presence and teaching of Jesus was something new and signaled the passing of the old. It could not be confined within the old religion of Judaism, but involved the inauguration and consummation of the kingdom of God.</p>
<A NAME="248"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=134><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;He&#8221;; the referent (Jesus) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="249"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=135><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;heads of grain.&#8221; While the generic term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#964;&#940;&#967;&#965;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">stacus</font>) can refer to the cluster of seeds at the top of grain such as barley or wheat, in the NT the term is restricted to wheat (L&amp;N 3.40; BDAG 941 s.v. 1).</p>
<A NAME="250"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=136><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And.&#8221; Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;so&#8221; to indicate the implied result of previous action(s) in the narrative.</p>
<A NAME="251"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=137><b>sn</b> See the note on <i>Pharisees</i> in 2:16.</p>
<A NAME="252"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=138><b>tn</b> A decision about the proper translation of this Greek phrase (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#8127;&#913;&#946;&#953;&#945;&#952;&#8048;&#961; &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#953;&#949;&#961;&#941;&#969;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">ejpi Abiaqar ajrcierew&quot;</font>) is very difficult for a number of reasons. The most natural translation of the phrase is &#8220;when Abiathar was high priest,&#8221; but this is problematic because Abiathar was not the high priest when David entered the temple and ate the sacred bread; Ahimelech is the priest mentioned in 1 Sam 21:1-7. Three main solutions have been suggested to resolve this difficulty. (1) There are alternate readings in various manuscripts, but these are not likely to be original: D W {271} it sy<sup>s</sup> and a few others omit <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#8127;&#913;&#946;&#953;&#945;&#952;&#8048;&#961; &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#953;&#949;&#961;&#941;&#969;&#962;</font>, no doubt in conformity to the parallels in Matt 12:4 and Luke 6:4; {A C <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#928;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#931;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#934;</font> 074 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13</sup> and many others} add <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#8166;</font> before <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#961;&#967;&#953;&#949;&#961;&#941;&#969;&#962;</font>, giving the meaning &#8220;in the days of Abiathar the high priest,&#8221; suggesting a more general time frame. Neither reading has significant external support and both most likely are motivated by the difficulty of the original reading. (2) Many scholars have hypothesized that one of the three individuals who would have been involved in the transmission of the statement (Jesus who uttered it originally, Mark who wrote it down in the Gospel, or Peter who served as Mark&#8217;s source) was either wrong about Abiathar or intentionally loose with the biblical data in order to make a point. (3) It is possible that what is currently understood to be the most natural reading of the text is in fact not correct. (a) There are very few biblical parallels to this grammatical construction (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#960;&#943;</font> + genitive proper noun, followed by an anarthrous common noun), so it is possible that an extensive search for this construction in nonbiblical literature would prove that the meaning does involve a wide time frame. If this is so, &#8220;in the days of Abiathar the high priest&#8221; would be a viable option. (b) It is also possible that this phrasing serves as a loose way to cite a scripture passage. There is a parallel to this construction in Mark 12:26: &#8220;Have you not read in the book of Moses, in the passage about the bush?&#8221; Here the final phrase is simply <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#946;&#940;&#964;&#959;&#965;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ejpi tou batou</font>), but the obvious function of the phrase is to point to a specific passage within the larger section of scripture. Deciding upon a translation here is difficult. The translation above has followed the current consensus on the most natural and probable meaning of the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#8127;&#913;&#946;&#953;&#945;&#952;&#8048;&#961; &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#953;&#949;&#961;&#941;&#969;&#962;</font>: &#8220;when Abiathar was high priest.&#8221; It should be recognized, however, that this translation is tentative because the current state of knowledge about the meaning of this grammatical construction is incomplete, and any decision about the meaning of this text is open to future revision.</p>
<A NAME="253"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=139><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the bread of presentation.&#8221; </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>The sacred bread</i> refers to the &#8220;bread of presentation,&#8221; &#8220;showbread,&#8221; or &#8220;bread of the Presence,&#8221; twelve loaves prepared weekly for the tabernacle and later, the temple. See Exod 25:30; 35:13; 39:36; Lev 24:5-9. Each loaf was made from 3 quarts (3.5 liters; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;two tenths of an ephah&#8221;) of fine flour. The loaves were placed on a table in the holy place of the tabernacle, on the north side opposite the lampstand (Exod 26:35). It was the duty of the priest each Sabbath to place fresh bread on the table; the loaves from the previous week were then given to Aaron and his descendants, who ate them in the holy place, because they were considered sacred (Lev 24:9). See also Matt 12:1-8, Luke 6:1-5.</p>
<A NAME="254"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=140><b>sn</b> Jesus&#8217; response to the charge that what his disciples were doing was <i>against the law </i>is one of analogy: &#8220;If David did it for his troops in a time of need, then so can I with my disciples.&#8221; Jesus is clear that on the surface there was a violation here. What is not as clear is whether he is arguing a &#8220;greater need&#8221; makes this permissible or that this was within the intention of the law all along.</p>

<A NAME="257"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=143><b>tn</b> The Greek term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anqrwpos</font>) is used twice in this verse in a generic sense, referring to both men and women, thus &#8220;people.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="258"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=144><b>tn</b> The term &#8220;lord&#8221; is in emphatic position in the Greek text.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> A second point in Jesus&#8217; defense of his disciples&#8217; actions was that his authority as <i>Son of Man</i> also allowed it, since as Son of Man he was <i>lord of the Sabbath</i>.</p>
