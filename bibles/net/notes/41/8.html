<A NAME="88"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=435><b>sn</b> <i>Mark 8:1-10. </i>Many commentators, on the basis of similarities between this account of the feeding of the multitude (8:1-10) and that in 6:30-44, have argued that there is only one event referred to in both passages. While there are similarities in language and in the response of the disciples, there are also noticeable differences, including the different number present on each occasion (i.e., 5,000 in chap. 6 and 4,000 here). In the final analysis, the fact that Jesus refers to two distinct feedings in 8:18-20 settles the issue; this passage represents another very similar incident to that recorded in 6:30-44.</p>

<A NAME="823"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=450><b>tc</b> &#8225; A difficult textual problem is found here, involving three different variants: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#955;&#941;&#947;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai legousin</font>) is found in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> <i>pc</i>; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#7985; &#948;&#8050; &#949;&#7990;&#960;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joi de eipon</font>) is the reading of <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>45</sup> A D W <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13</sup> 33 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> it; and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#955;&#941;&#947;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai legousin autw</font>) is supported by B C L (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#916;</font> 579 892) 2427 <i>pc</i>. The first two variants would not be translated differently; the third reading, however, would add &#8220;to him&#8221; after &#8220;they replied.&#8221; What complicates the issue is that the external evidence is fairly evenly split between the second and third readings, though the first reading is in agreement with the second reading in lacking the dative pronoun. Indeed, another layout of the problem here could treat this as two distinct problems: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#955;&#941;&#947;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#957;</font> vs. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#7985; &#948;&#8050; &#949;&#7990;&#960;&#959;&#957;</font> and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183;</font> vs. omission of the word. In this second arrangement of the problem, the reading without the pronoun has slightly stronger support (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>45</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A D W <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13</sup> 33 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> it). Internally, Mark never elsewhere uses the form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7990;&#960;&#959;&#957;</font> for the third person plural indicative form of this verb (it is always <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7990;&#960;&#945;&#957;</font> [<font face="Greektl">eipan</font>]). And although only one other time in Mark is the object lacking after <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#957;</font> (6:38), it is a similar context (viz., the disciples&#8217; response before Jesus feeds the 5000). Very tentatively, the reading that is followed here is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#955;&#941;&#947;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#957;</font>. NA<sup>27</sup> puts <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183;</font> in brackets, indicating some doubt as to its authenticity.</p>

In the intertestamental period it developed further into a technical term referring to the hoped-for anointed one, that is, a specific individual. In the NT the development starts there (technical-specific), is so used in the gospels, and then develops in Paul to mean virtually Jesus&#8217; last name.</p>
<A NAME="842"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=469><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;Then&#8221; to indicate the conclusion of the episode.</p>
<A NAME="843"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=470><b>sn</b> <i>Mark 8:27-10:52. </i>The entire section 8:27-10:52 is built around three passion predictions of Jesus (8:31; 9:31; 10:33). These predictions form the structure of the section, the content for the section (Jesus&#8217; suffering, death, and the meaning of genuine discipleship) and the mood of the section (i.e., a somber mood). What is interesting is that after each passion prediction, Mark records both the misunderstanding of the disciples and then Jesus&#8217; teaching on the nature of his death and what genuine discipleship is all about: (1) denying oneself (8:34-38); (2) humility and serving (9:33-37); (3) suffering, humble service, and not lording it over people (10:35-45). For further discussion of the structure of the passage, see W. L. Lane, <i>Mark</i> (NICNT)<i>, </i>292-94.</p>
