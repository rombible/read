<A NAME="618"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=330><b>sn</b> Herod was technically not a <i>king</i>, but a tetrarch, a ruler with rank and authority lower than a king. A tetrarch ruled only with the approval of the Roman authorities. This was roughly equivalent to being governor of a region. In the NT, Herod, who ruled over Galilee, is called a king (Matt 14:9, Mark 6:14-29), reflecting popular usage rather than an official title.</p>
