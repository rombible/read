<A NAME="635"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=347><b>tc</b> &#8225; The witnesses here support several different readings: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8135; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#940;</font> (<font face="Greektl">auth polla</font>, &#8220;to her insistently&#8221;) is found in D <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> 565 700 it; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#940;</font> is the reading of <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>45vid</sup> 28; both words are lacking in L <i>pc</i>; and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A B C<sup>2vid</sup> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13</sup> 33 2427 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat have just <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8135;</font>. The best candidates for authenticity, on external grounds, are <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8135; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#940;</font> and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8135;</font>. So the issue revolves around whether <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#940;</font> is part of the text. On the one hand, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#940;</font> used adverbially is a distinctive Markanism (10 of the 16 NT instances are found in Mark; of the other Gospels, Matthew alone adds a single example [Matt 9:14]). It could be argued that such an unremarkable term would go unnoticed by the scribes, and consequently would not have been inserted in imitation of Mark&#8217;s style observed elsewhere. On the other hand, the largest cluster of instances of an adverbial <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#940;</font> are in Mark 5-6, with the most recent example coming just three verses earlier (Mark 5:23, 38, 43; 6:20). Scribes may well have imitated the usage so recently and so frequently seen. Further, the best Alexandrian witnesses, as well as good representatives of the Western and Byzantines texts, lack <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#940;</font>. On the whole, though a decision is difficult, it is probably best to read the text without <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#940;</font>. NA<sup>27</sup> places the word in brackets, indicating some doubt as to its authenticity.</p>
