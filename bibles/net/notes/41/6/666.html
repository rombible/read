<A NAME="666"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=378><b>sn</b> The statement <i>he wanted to pass by them </i>is somewhat difficult to understand. There are at least two common interpretations: (1) it refers to the perspective of the disciples, that is, from their point of view it seemed that Jesus wanted to pass by them; or (2) it refers to a theophany and uses the language of the Greek Old Testament (LXX) when God &#8220;passed by&#8221; Moses at Sinai (cf. Exod 33:19, 22). According to the latter alternative, Jesus is &#8220;passing by&#8221; the disciples during their struggle, in order to assure them of his presence with them. See W L. Lane, <i>Mark </i>(NICNT), 236.</p>
