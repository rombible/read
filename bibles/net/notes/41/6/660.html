On the other hand, just as weighty <sc>mss (A B L 33 2427 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>) have the words. Although a decision is not easy, the most satisfactory explanation seems to be that scribes were more prone to delete than to add the words here. They may have been puzzled as to why &#8220;the bread&#8221; should be mentioned without a corresponding mention of &#8220;fish.&#8221; Since neither Matt 14:21 or Luke 9:17 explicitly mention the bread, a desire for harmonization may have motivated the copyists as well. On the other hand, D and W are prone to longer, explanatory readings. Since they both lack the words here, it is likely that their archetypes also lacked the words. But given Mark&#8217;s pleonastic style, the good witnesses with &#8220;the bread,&#8221; and a reasonable explanation for the omission, &#8220;the bread&#8221; is most likely part of the original text of Mark.</p>
