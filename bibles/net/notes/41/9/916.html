<A NAME="916"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=492><b>sn</b> In 1st century Judaism and in the NT, there was the belief that the righteous get new, glorified bodies in order to enter heaven (1 Cor 15:42-49; 2 Cor 5:1-10). This transformation means the righteous will share the glory of God. One recalls the way Moses shared the Lord&#8217;s glory after his visit to the mountain in Exod 34. So the disciples saw Jesus <i>transfigured</i>, and they were getting a sneak preview of the great glory that Jesus would have (only his glory is more inherent to him as one who shares in the rule of the kingdom).</p>
