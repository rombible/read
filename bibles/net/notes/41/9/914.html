<A NAME="914"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=490><b>sn</b> Several suggestions have been made as to the referent for the phrase <i>the kingdom of God come with power</i>: (1) the transfiguration itself, which immediately follows in the narrative; (2) Jesus&#8217; resurrection and ascension; (3) the coming of the Spirit; (4) Jesus&#8217; second coming and the establishment of the kingdom. The reference to <i>after six days</i> in 9:2 seems to indicate that Mark had the transfiguration in mind insofar as it was a substantial prefiguring of the consummation of the kingdom (although this interpretation is not without its problems). As such, the transfiguration was a tremendous confirmation to the disciples that even though Jesus had just finished speaking of his death (8:31; 9:31; 10:33), he was nonetheless the promised Messiah and things were proceeding according to God&#8217;s plan.</p>
