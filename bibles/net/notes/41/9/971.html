<A NAME="971"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=547><b>tc</b> The earliest <sc>mss ([<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>] B L [W] <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#916;</font> 0274 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13</sup> 28* 565 700 <i>pc </i>sy<sup>s </sup>sa) have the reading adopted by the translation. Codex Bezae (D) and several Itala read &#8220;Every sacrifice will be salted with salt.&#8221; The majority of other <sc>mss (A C <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> [2427] <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font><i> </i>lat sy<sup>p,h</sup>) have both readings, &#8220;Everyone will be salted with fire, and every sacrifice will be salted with salt.&#8221; An early scribe may have written the LXX text of Lev 2:13 (&#8220;Every sacrifice offering of yours shall be salted with salt&#8221;) in the margin of his ms. At a later stage, copyists would either replace the text with this marginal note or add the note to the text. The longer reading thus seems to be the result of the conflation of the Alexandrian reading &#8220;salted with fire&#8221; and the Western reading &#8220;salted with salt.&#8221; The reading adopted by the text enjoys the best support and explains the other readings in the ms tradition. </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The statement <i>everyone will be salted with fire</i> is difficult to interpret. It may be a reference to (1) unbelievers who enter hell as punishment for rejection of Jesus, indicating that just as salt preserves so they will be preserved in their punishment in hell forever; (2) Christians who experience suffering in this world because of their attachment to Christ; (3) any person who experiences suffering in a way appropriate to their relationship to Jesus. For believers this means the suffering of purification, and for unbelievers it means hell, i.e., eternal torment. </p>
