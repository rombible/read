<A NAME="1515"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=923><b>tc</b> Instead of &#8220;what do you want me to do&#8221; several witnesses, including the most important ones (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B C W <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#916;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13</sup> 33 892 2427 <i>pc</i>), lack <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#941;&#955;&#949;&#964;&#949;</font> (<font face="Greektl">qelete</font>, &#8220;you want&#8221;), turning the question into the more abrupt &#8220;what should I do?&#8221; Although the witnesses for the longer reading are not as significant (A D <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> 0250 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> latt sy), the reading without <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#941;&#955;&#949;&#964;&#949;</font> conforms to Matt 27:22 and thus is suspected of being a scribal emendation. The known scribal tendency to assimilate one synoptic passage to another parallel, coupled with the lack of such assimilation in <sc>mss that are otherwise known to do this most frequently (the Western and Byzantine texts), suggests that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#941;&#955;&#949;&#964;&#949;</font> is authentic. Further, Mark&#8217;s known style of being generally more verbose and redundant than Matthew&#8217;s argues that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#941;&#955;&#949;&#964;&#949;</font> is authentic here. That this is the longer reading, however, and that a good variety of witnesses omit the word, gives one pause. Perhaps the wording without <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#941;&#955;&#949;&#964;&#949;</font> would have been perceived as having greater homiletical value, motivating scribes to move in this direction. A decision is difficult, but on the whole internal evidence leads toward regarding <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#941;&#955;&#949;&#964;&#949;</font> as authentic.</p>
<A NAME="1516"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=924><b>sn</b> Crucifixion was the cruelest form of punishment practiced by the Romans. Roman citizens could not normally undergo it. It was reserved for the worst crimes, like treason and evasion of due process in a capital case. The Roman historian Cicero called it &#8220;a cruel and disgusting penalty&#8221; (<i>Against Verres</i> 2.5.63-66 §§163-70); Josephus (<i>J. W. </i>7.6.4 [7.203]) called it the worst of deaths.</p>
<A NAME="1517"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=925><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;then&#8221; to indicate the implied sequence of events within the narrative.</p>
<A NAME="1518"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=926><b>tn</b> The Greek term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#966;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#955;&#972;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">fragellow</font>) refers to flogging. BDAG 1064 s.v. states, &#8220;<i>flog, scourge,</i> a punishment inflicted on slaves and provincials after a sentence of death had been pronounced on them. So in the case of Jesus before the crucifixion&#8230;Mt 27:26; Mk 15:15.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> A Roman flogging (traditionally, &#8220;scourging&#8221;) was an excruciating punishment. The victim was stripped of his clothes and bound to a post with his hands fastened above him (or sometimes he was thrown to the ground). Guards standing on either side of the victim would incessantly beat him with a whip (<i>flagellum</i>) made out of leather with pieces of lead and bone inserted into its ends. While the Jews only allowed 39 lashes, the Romans had no such limit; many people who received such a beating died as a result. See C. Schneider, <i>TDNT</i>, 4:515-19. </p>

<A NAME="1521"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=929><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;(that is, the praetorium).&#8221; </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The <i>governor&#8217;s residence</i> (<i>Grk </i>&#8220;praetorium&#8221;) was the Roman governor&#8217;s official residence. The one in Jerusalem may have been Herod&#8217;s palace in the western part of the city, or the fortress Antonia northwest of the temple area.</p>
<A NAME="1522"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=930><b>sn</b> A Roman <i>cohort</i> was a tenth of a legion, about 500-600 soldiers.</p>
<A NAME="1523"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=931><b>sn</b> The <i>purple cloak </i>probably refers to a military garment which had the color of royal <i>purple</i>, and thus resembled a king&#8217;s robe. The soldiers did this to Jesus as a form of mockery in view of the charges that he was a king (cf. 15:2).</p>
<A NAME="1524"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=932><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;weaving.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1525"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=933><b>sn</b> The <i>crown</i> may have been made from palm spines or some other thorny plant common in Israel. In placing the crown of <i>thorns </i>on his head, the soldiers were unwittingly symbolizing God&#8217;s curse on humanity (cf. Gen 3:18) being placed on Jesus. Their purpose would have been to mock Jesus&#8217; claim to be a king; the crown of thorns would have represented the &#8220;radiant corona&#8221; portrayed on the heads of rulers on coins and other artifacts in the 1st century.</p>
<A NAME="1526"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=934><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Long live the King of the Jews!&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The statement <i>Hail, King of the Jews!</i> is a mockery patterned after the Romans&#8217; cry of <i>Ave, Caesar</i> (&#8220;Hail, Caesar!&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="1527"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=935><b>tn</b> The verb here has been translated as an iterative imperfect.</p>

<A NAME="1534"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=942><b>sn</b> Jesus was beaten severely with a whip before this (the prelude to crucifixion, known to the Romans as <i>verberatio</i>, mentioned in Matt 27:26; Mark 15:15; John 19:1), so he would have been weak from trauma and loss of blood. Apparently he was unable to bear the cross himself, so <i>Simon</i> was conscripted to help (in all probability this was only the crossbeam, called in Latin the <i>patibulum</i>, since the upright beam usually remained in the ground at the place of execution). <i>Cyrene</i> was located in North Africa where Tripoli is today. Nothing more is known about this Simon.</p>
<A NAME="1535"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=943><b>tn</b> Or perhaps, &#8220;was coming in from his field&#8221; outside the city (BDAG 15-16 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#947;&#961;&#972;&#962;</font> 1).</p>

<A NAME="1538"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=946><b>sn</b> <i>The place called Golgotha (which is translated &#8220;Place of the Skull&#8221;). </i>This location is north and just outside of Jerusalem. The hill on which it is located protruded much like a skull, giving the place its name. The Latin word for the Greek term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#961;&#945;&#957;&#943;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kranion</font>) is <i>calvaria</i>, from which the English word &#8220;Calvary&#8221; is derived (cf. Luke 23:33 in the KJV).</p>
<A NAME="1539"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=947><b>sn</b> It is difficult to say for certain who gave Jesus this drink of <i>wine mixed with myrrh</i> (e.g., the executioner, or perhaps women from Jerusalem). In any case, whoever gave it to him most likely did so in order to relieve his pain, but Jesus was unwilling to take it.</p>
<A NAME="1540"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=948><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;then&#8221; to indicate the implied sequence of events within the narrative.</p>
<A NAME="1541"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=949><b>sn</b> See the note on <i>Crucify</i> in 15:13.</p>
<A NAME="1542"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=950><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;by throwing the lot&#8221; (probably by using marked pebbles or broken pieces of pottery). A modern equivalent, &#8220;throwing dice,&#8221; was chosen here because of its association with gambling. According to L&amp;N 6.219 a term for &#8220;dice&#8221; is particularly appropriate.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> An allusion to Ps 22:18.</p>
<A NAME="1543"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=951><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;It was the third hour.&#8221; This time would have been approximate, and could refer to the beginning of the process, some time before Jesus was lifted on the cross.</p>
<A NAME="1544"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=952><b>sn</b> Mention of the<i> inscription</i> is an important detail, because the inscription would normally give the reason for the execution. It shows that Jesus was executed for claiming to be a king. It was also probably written with irony from the executioners&#8217; point of view.</p>
<A NAME="1545"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=953><b>tc</b> Most later <sc>mss add <b>15:28</b> &#8220;And the scripture was fulfilled that says, &#8216;He was counted with the lawless ones.&#8217;&#8221; Verse 28 is included in L <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> 083 0250 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13</sup> 33 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat, but is lacking in important Alexandrian and Western <sc>mss and some others (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A B C D <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> <i>pc</i>). The addition of the verse with its quotation from Isa 53:12 probably represents a scribal assimilation from Luke 22:37. It was almost certainly not an original part of Mark&#8217;s Gospel. The present translation follows NA<sup>27</sup> in omitting the verse number, a procedure also followed by a number of other modern translations.</p>
<A NAME="1546"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=954><b>sn</b> There is rich irony in the statement of those who were passing by, &#8220;<i>Save yourself and come down from the cross!</i>&#8221; In summary, they wanted Jesus to come down from the cross and save his physical life, but it was indeed his staying on the cross and giving his physical life that led to the fact that they could experience a resurrection from death to life. There is a similar kind of irony in the statement made by the chief priests and experts in the law in 15:31. </p>
<A NAME="1547"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=955><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;with the scribes.&#8221; See the note on the phrase &#8220;experts in the law&#8221; in 1:22. Only &#8220;chief priests&#8221; is in the nominative case; this sentence structure attempts to capture this emphasis.</p>
<A NAME="1548"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=956><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Mocking him, the chief priests&#8230;said among themselves.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="1550"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=958><b>sn</b> Mark&#8217;s wording suggests that both of the criminals <i>spoke abusively to him. </i>If so, one of them quickly changed his attitude toward Jesus (see Luke 23:40-43).</p>
<A NAME="1551"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=959><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;now&#8221; to indicate the transition to a new topic.</p>

<A NAME="1553"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=961><b>sn</b> This imagery has parallels to the Day of the Lord: Joel 2:10; Amos 8:9; Zeph 1:15.</p>

<A NAME="1555"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=963><b>tn</b> The repetition of the phrase &#8220;three o&#8217;clock&#8221; preserves the author&#8217;s rougher, less elegant style (cf. Matt 27:45-46; Luke 23:44). Although such stylistic matters are frequently handled differently in the translation, because the issue of synoptic literary dependence is involved here, it was considered important to reflect some of the stylistic differences among the synoptics in the translation, so that the English reader can be aware of them.</p>
<A NAME="1556"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=964><b>sn</b> A quotation from Ps 22:1.</p>
<A NAME="1557"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=965><b>sn</b> Perhaps the crowd thought Jesus was <i>calling for Elijah</i> because the exclamation &#8220;my God, my God&#8221; (i.e., in Aramaic, <i>Eloi</i>, <i>Eloi</i>) sounds like the name Elijah.</p>
<A NAME="1558"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=966><b>sn</b> <i>Sour wine </i>refers to cheap wine that was called in Latin <i>posca</i>, a cheap vinegar wine diluted heavily with water. It was the drink of slaves and soldiers, and was probably there for the soldiers who had performed the crucifixion.</p>

It could refer to the curtain separating the holy of holies from the holy place (Josephus, <i>J. W. </i>5.5.5 [5.219]), or it could refer to one at the entrance of the temple court (Josephus, <i>J. W.</i> 5.5.4 [5.212]). Many argue that the inner curtain is meant because another term, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#940;&#955;&#965;&#956;&#956;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kalumma</font>), is also used for the outer curtain. Others see a reference to the outer curtain as more likely because of the public nature of this sign. Either way, the symbolism means that access to God has been opened up. It also pictures a judgment that includes the sacrifices.</p>
<A NAME="1561"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=969><b>sn</b> A <i>centurion</i> was a noncommissioned officer in the Roman army or one of the auxiliary territorial armies, commanding a <i>centuria</i> of (nominally) 100 men. The responsibilities of centurions were broadly similar to modern junior officers, but there was a wide gap in social status between them and officers, and relatively few were promoted beyond the rank of senior centurion. The Roman troops stationed in Judea were auxiliaries, who would normally be rewarded with Roman citizenship after 25 years of service. Some of the centurions may have served originally in the Roman legions (regular army) and thus gained their citizenship at enlistment. Others may have inherited it, like Paul.</p>
