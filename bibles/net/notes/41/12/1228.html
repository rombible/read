<A NAME="1228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=705><b>sn</b> <i>Pharisees and Herodians</i> made a very interesting alliance. W. W. Wessel (&#8220;Mark,&#8221; <i>EBC </i>8:733) comments: &#8220;The Herodians were as obnoxious to the Pharisees on political grounds as the Sadducees were on theological grounds. Yet the two groups united in their opposition to Jesus. Collaboration in wickedness, as well as goodness, has great power. Their purpose was to trip Jesus up in his words so that he would lose the support of the people, leaving the way open for them to destroy him.&#8221; See also the note on &#8220;Herodians&#8221; in Mark 3:6.</p>
