<A NAME="1270"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">70</span><note=747><b>sn</b> <i>The Lord said to my Lord. </i>With David being the speaker, this indicates his respect for his descendant (referred to as <i>my Lord</i>). Jesus was arguing, as the ancient exposition assumed, that the passage is about the Lord&#8217;s anointed. The passage looks at an enthronement of this figure and a declaration of honor for him as he takes his place at the side of God. In Jerusalem, the king&#8217;s palace was located to the right of the temple to indicate this kind of relationship. Jesus was pressing the language here to get his opponents to reflect on how great Messiah is.</p>
