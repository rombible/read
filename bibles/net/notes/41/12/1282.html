<A NAME="1282"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">82</span><note=759><b>tn</b> On the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#945;&#950;&#959;&#966;&#965;&#955;&#940;&#954;&#953;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">gazofulakion</font>), often translated &#8220;treasury,&#8221; see BDAG 186 s.v., which states, &#8220;For Mk 12:41, 43; Lk 21:1 the mng. <i>contribution box</i> or <i>receptacle</i> is attractive. Acc. to Mishnah, Shekalim 6, 5 there were in the temple 13 such receptacles in the form of trumpets. But even in these passages the general sense of &#8216;treasury&#8217; is prob., for the contributions would go [into] the treasury via the receptacles.&#8221; Based upon the extra-biblical evidence (see <b>sn</b> following), however, the translation opts to refer to the actual receptacles and not the treasury itself.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The <i>offering box</i> probably refers to the receptacles in the temple forecourt by the Court of Women used to collect freewill offerings. These are mentioned by Josephus, <i>J. W.</i> 5.5.2 (5.200); 6.5.2 (6.282); <i>Ant.</i> 19.6.1 (19.294), and in 1 Macc 14:49 and 2 Macc 3:6, 24, 28, 40 (see also Luke 21:1; John 8:20).</p>
