<A NAME="122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=679><b>sn</b><i> </i>The <i>vineyard</i> is a figure for Israel in the OT (Isa 5:1-7). The nation and its leaders are the tenants, so the vineyard here may well refer to the promise that resides within the nation. The imagery is like that in Rom 11:11-24.</p>
