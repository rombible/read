<A NAME="359"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=203><b>sn</b> The issue of whether Jesus had <i>brothers </i>(siblings) has had a long history in the church. Epiphanius, in the 4th century, argued that Mary was a perpetual virgin and had no offspring other than Jesus. Others argued that these brothers were really cousins. Nothing in the text suggests any of this. See also John 7:3.</p>
