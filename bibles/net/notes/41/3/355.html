<A NAME="355"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=199><b>sn</b> <i>Is guilty of an eternal sin.</i> This passage has troubled many people, who have wondered whether or not they have committed this <i>eternal</i> <i>sin</i>. Three things must be kept in mind: (1) the nature of the sin is to ascribe what is the obvious work of the Holy Spirit (e.g., releasing people from Satan&#8217;s power) to Satan himself; (2) it is not simply a momentary doubt or sinful attitude, but is indeed a settled condition which opposes the Spirit&#8217;s work, as typified by the religious leaders who opposed Jesus; and (3) a person who is concerned about it has probably never committed this sin, for those who commit it here (i.e., the religious leaders) are not in the least concerned about Jesus&#8217; warning. On this last point see W. W. Wessel, &#8220;Mark,&#8221; <i>EBC </i>8:645-46.</p>
