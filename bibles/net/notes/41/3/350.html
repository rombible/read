<A NAME="350"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=194><b>sn</b> The three conditional statements in vv. 24-26 express the logical result of the assumption that Jesus heals by Satan&#8217;s power, expressed by the religious leaders. The point is clear: If the leaders are correct, then Satan&#8217;s kingdom will not stand, so the suggestion makes no sense. Satan would not seek to heal.</p>
