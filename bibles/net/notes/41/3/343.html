<A NAME="343"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=187><b>tc</b> Western witnesses D W it, instead of reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#7985; &#960;&#945;&#961;&#8127; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joi par</font>&#8217;<font face="Greektl"> aujtou</font>, here translated &#8220;family&#8221;), have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#959;&#7985; &#947;&#961;&#945;&#956;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#949;&#8150;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#959;&#7985; &#955;&#959;&#953;&#960;&#959;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">peri autou Joi grammatei&quot; kai Joi loipoi</font>, &#8220;[when] the scribes and others [heard] about him&#8221;). But this reading is obviously motivated, for it removes the embarrassing statement about Jesus&#8217; family&#8217;s opinion of him as &#8220;out of his mind&#8221; and transfers this view to the Lord&#8217;s opponents. The fact that virtually all other witnesses have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#7985; &#960;&#945;&#961;&#8127; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</font> here, coupled with the strong internal evidence for the shorter reading, shows this Western reading to be secondary.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> On the meaning &#8220;family&#8221; for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#7985; &#960;&#945;&#961;&#8127; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joi par</font>&#8217;<font face="Greektl"> autou</font>), see BDAG 756-57 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#940;</font> A.3.b.<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#946;</font>.<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;</font>.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The incident involving the religious leaders accusing Jesus of being in league with the devil (3:22-30) is sandwiched between Mark&#8217;s mention of Jesus&#8217; <i>family</i> coming <i>to restrain him </i>(the Greek word for <i>restrain </i>here is also used to mean <i>arrest</i>; see Mark 6:17; 12:12; 14:1, 44, 46, 49, 51) because they thought he was <i>out of his mind</i> (3:21). It is probably Mark&#8217;s intention in this structure to show that Jesus&#8217; family is to be regarded as not altogether unlike the experts in the law [scribes] in their perception of the true identity of Jesus; they are incorrect in their understanding of him as well. The tone is obviously one of sadness and the emphasis on Jesus&#8217; true family in vv. 31-35 serves to underscore the comparison between his relatives and the scribes on the one hand, and those who truly obey God on the other. </p>
