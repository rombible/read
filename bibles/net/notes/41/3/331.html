<A NAME="331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=175><b>tc</b> The phrase &#8220;whom he named apostles&#8221; is lacking in the majority of <sc>mss (A C<sup>2</sup> [D] L <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1 </sup>33 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font><i> </i>latt sy). Several primary Alexandrian and Caesarean witnesses (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B [C* W] <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13</sup> 28 <i>pc</i> co) include the phrase, so the external evidence is strongly in favor of this reading, especially since Alexandrian witnesses tend to witness to the <i>shorter</i> reading. It is possible that the Alexandrian witnesses have inserted these words to bring the text in line with Luke 6:13 (<i>TCGNT</i> 69), but against this is the internal evidence of Mark&#8217;s style: Mark tends toward gratuitous redundancy. Thus the inclusion of this phrase is supported by both internal and external evidence and should be regarded as more likely original than the omission.</p>
