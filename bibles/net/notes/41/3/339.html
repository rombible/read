<A NAME="339"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=183><b>sn</b> There is some debate about what the name <i>Iscariot</i> means. It probably alludes to a region in Judea and thus might make Judas the only non-Galilean in the group. Several explanations for the name <i>Iscariot</i> have been proposed, but it is probably transliterated Hebrew with the meaning &#8220;man of Kerioth&#8221; (there are at least two villages that had that name). For further discussion see D. L. Bock, <i>Luke</i> (BECNT), 1:546; also D. A. Carson, <i>John</i>, 304.</p>
