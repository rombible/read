<A NAME="1327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=792><b>sn</b><i> Suffering unlike anything that has happened</i>. Some refer this event to the destruction of Jerusalem in <sc>a.d. 70. While the events of <sc>a.d. 70 may reflect somewhat the comments Jesus makes here, the reference to the scope and severity of this judgment strongly suggest that much more is in view. Most likely Jesus is referring to the great end-time judgment on Jerusalem in the great tribulation.</p>
