<A NAME="1339"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=804><b>sn</b> This is one of the hardest verses in the gospels to interpret. Various views exist for what <i>generation</i> means. (1) Some take it as meaning &#8220;race&#8221; and thus as an assurance that the Jewish race (nation) will not pass away. But it is very questionable that the Greek term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#949;&#957;&#949;&#940;</font> (<font face="Greektl">genea</font>) can have this meaning. Two other options are possible. (2) <i>Generation</i> might mean &#8220;this type of generation&#8221; and refer to the generation of wicked humanity. Then the point is that humanity will not perish, because God will redeem it. Or (3) <i>generation </i>may refer to &#8220;the generation that sees the signs of the end&#8221; (v. 26), who will also see the end itself. In other words, once the movement to the return of Christ starts, all the events connected with it happen very quickly, in rapid succession.</p>
