<A NAME="1321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=786><b>sn</b> <i>But the one who endures to the end will be saved.</i> Jesus was not claiming here that salvation is by works, because he had already taught that it is by grace (cf. 10:15). He was simply arguing that genuine faith evidences itself in persistence through even the worst of trials. </p>
