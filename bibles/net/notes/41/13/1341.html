<A NAME="1341"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=806><b>sn</b> The phrase <i>nor the Son</i> has caused a great deal of theological debate because on the surface it appears to conflict with the concept of Jesus&#8217; deity. The straightforward meaning of the text is that the Son does not know the time of his return. If Jesus were divine, though, wouldn&#8217;t he know this information? There are other passages which similarly indicate that Jesus did not know certain things. For example, Luke 2:52 indicates that Jesus grew in wisdom; this has to mean that Jesus did not know everything all the time but learned as he grew. So Mark 13:32 is not alone in implying that Jesus did not know certain things. The best option for understanding Mark 13:32 and similar passages is to hold the two concepts in tension: The Son in his earthly life and ministry had limited knowledge of certain things, yet he was still deity.</p>
