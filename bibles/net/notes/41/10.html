It is difficult to decide between the Alexandrian and Western readings here, but since the parallel in Matt 19:1 omits <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> the weight is slightly in favor of including it here; scribes may have omitted the word here to harmonize this passage to the Matthean passage. Because of the perceived geographical difficulties found in the earlier readings (omission of the word &#8220;and&#8221; would make it seem as though Judea is beyond the Jordan), the majority of the witnesses (A <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>) read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#8048; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#960;&#941;&#961;&#945;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">dia tou peran</font>, &#8220;through the other side&#8221;), perhaps trying to indicate the direction of Jesus&#8217; travel.</p>

The longer reading, a specific identification of the subject, may have been prompted by the parallel in Matt 19:3. The fact that the <sc>mss vary in how they express this subject lends credence to this judgment: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#7985; &#948;&#8050; &#934;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#945;&#8150;&#959;&#953;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#949;&#955;&#952;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joi de Farisaioi proselqonte&quot;</font>, &#8220;now the Pharisees came&#8221;) in W <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> 565 2542 <i>pc</i>; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#949;&#955;&#952;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962; &#959;&#7985; &#934;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#945;&#8150;&#959;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai proselqonte&quot; Joi Farisaioi</font>, &#8220;then the Pharisees came&#8221;) in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> C N (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1</sup>: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#949;&#955;&#952;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962; &#7952;&#960;&#951;&#961;&#8061;&#964;&#951;&#963;&#945;&#957; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#959;&#7985; &#934;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#945;&#8150;&#959;&#953;</font>) 579 1241 1424 <i>pm</i>; and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#949;&#955;&#952;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962; &#934;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#945;&#8150;&#959;&#953;</font> in A B K L <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#915;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#916;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13</sup> 28 700 892 2427 <i>pm</i>. Further, the use of an indefinite plural (a general &#8220;they&#8221;) is a Markan feature, occurring over twenty times. Thus, internally the evidence looks rather strong for the shorter reading, in spite of the minimal external support for it. However, if scribes assimilated this text to Matt 19:3, a more exact parallel might have been expected: Matthew has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#8134;&#955;&#952;&#959;&#957; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183; &#934;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#945;&#8150;&#959;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai proshlqon aujtw Farisaioi</font>, &#8220;then Pharisees came to him&#8221;). Although the verb form needs to be different according to syntactical requirements of the respective sentences, the word order variety, as well as the presence or absence of the article and the alternation between <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> as the introductory conjunction, all suggest that the variety of readings might not be due to scribal adjustments toward Matthew. At the same time, the article with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#934;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#945;&#8150;&#959;&#953;</font> is found in both Gospels in many of the same witnesses (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> in Matt; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> <i>pm</i> in Mark), and the anarthrous <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#934;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#945;&#8150;&#959;&#953;</font> is likewise parallel in many <sc>mss (B L <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13 </sup>700 892). Another consideration is the possibility that very early in the transmissional history, scribes naturally inserted the most obvious subject (the Pharisees would be the obvious candidates as the ones to test Jesus). This may account for the reading with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font>, since Mark nowhere else uses this conjunction to introduce the Pharisees into the narrative. As solid as the internal arguments against the longer reading seem to be, the greatest weakness is the witnesses that support it. The Western <sc>mss are prone to alter the text by adding, deleting, substituting, or rearranging large amounts of material. There are times when the rationale for this seems inexplicable. In light of the much stronger evidence for &#8220;the Pharisees came,&#8221; even though it occurs in various permutations, it is probably wisest to retain the words. This judgment, however, is hardly certain.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> See the note on <i>Pharisees</i> in 2:16.</p>
<A NAME="106"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=555><b>tn</b> In Greek this phrase occurs at the end of the sentence. It has been brought forward to conform to English style.</p>
<A NAME="107"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=556><b>tn</b> The personal pronoun &#8220;his&#8221; is not in the Greek text, but is certainly implied and has been supplied in the English translation to clarify the sense of the statement (cf. &#8220;his wife&#8221; in 10:7). </p>
<A NAME="108"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=557><b>tn</b> The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ei</font>) is often used to introduce both indirect and direct questions. Thus, another possible translation is to take this as an indirect question: &#8220;They asked him if it were lawful for a man to divorce his wife.&#8221; See BDF §440.3.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The question of the Pharisees was anything but sincere; they were asking it <i>to test him</i>. Jesus was now in the jurisdiction of Herod Antipas (i.e., Judea and beyond the Jordan) and it is likely that the Pharisees were hoping he might answer the question of divorce in a way similar to John the Baptist and so suffer the same fate as John, i.e., death at the hands of Herod (cf. 6:17-19). Jesus answered the question not on the basis of rabbinic custom and the debate over Deut 24:1, but rather from the account of creation and God&#8217;s original design.</p>

The Pharisees were all in agreement that the OT <i>permitted a man to write a certificate of dismissal and</i> <i>divorce</i> his wife (not vice-versa) and that remarriage was therefore sanctioned. But the two rabbinic schools of Shammai and Hillel differed on the grounds for divorce. Shammai was much stricter than Hillel and permitted divorce only in the case of sexual immorality. Hillel permitted divorce for almost any reason (cf. the Mishnah, <i>m. Gittin </i>9.10).</p>

On the one hand, it is possible that the shorter reading is an assimilation to the wording of the LXX of Gen 1:27b where <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font> is lacking. However, since it is mentioned at the beginning of the verse (Gen 1:27a) with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#960;&#959;&#943;&#951;&#963;&#949;&#957;</font> scribes may have been motivated to add it in Mark to make the subject clear. Further, confusion could easily arise in this dominical saying, because Moses was the previously mentioned subject (v. 5) and inattentive readers might regard him as the subject of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#960;&#959;&#943;&#951;&#963;&#949;&#957;</font> in v. 6. Thus, both on internal and external grounds, the most probable wording of the original text here lacked <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font>.</p>
<A NAME="1013"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=562><b>sn</b> A quotation from Gen 1:27; 5:2.</p>
<A NAME="1014"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=563><b>tc</b> &#8225; The earliest witnesses, as well as a few other important <sc>mss (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 892* 2427 sy<sup>s</sup>), lack the rest of the quotation from Gen 2:24, &#8220;and will be united with his wife.&#8221; Most <sc>mss ([A C] D [L N] W [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#916;</font>] <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>[1],13</sup> [579] <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat co) have the clause. It could be argued that the shorter reading was an accidental omission, due to this clause and v. 8 both beginning with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>, &#8220;and&#8221;). But if that were the case, one might expect to see corrections in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> or B. This can be overstated, of course; both <sc>mss combine in their errors on several other occasions. However, the nature of the omission here (both its length and the fact that it is from the OT) argues that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> and B reflect the original wording. Further, the form of the longer reading is identical with the LXX of Gen 2:24, but different from the quotation in Matt 19:5 (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#954;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#8053;&#963;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;</font> vs. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#8053;&#963;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;</font> [<font face="Greektl">proskollhqhsetai</font> vs. <font face="Greektl">kollhqhsetai</font>], <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#947;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#8150;&#954;&#945;</font> vs. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8135; &#947;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#953;&#954;&#943;</font> [<font face="Greektl">pro&quot; thn gunaika</font> vs. <font face="Greektl">th gunaiki</font>]). The significance of this is that Matthew&#8217;s quotations of the OT are often, if not usually, directly from the Hebrew &#8211; except when he is following Mark&#8217;s quotation of the OT. Matthew in fact only departs from Mark&#8217;s verbatim quotation of the LXX in 15:4 and 19:19, both texts quoting from Exod 20:12/Deut 5:6 (and in both places the only difference from Mark/LXX is the dropping of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#959;&#965;</font> [<font face="Greektl">sou</font>, &#8220;your&#8221;]). This might suggest that the longer reading here was not part of what the first evangelist had in his copy of Mark. Further, the reading without this line is harder, for the wife is not explicitly mentioned in v. 7; the casual reader could read &#8220;the two&#8221; of v. 8 as referring to father and mother rather than husband and wife. (And Mark is known for having harder, shorter readings that scribes tried to soften by explanatory expansion: In this chapter alone, cf. the textual problems in v. 6 [the insertion of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font>]; in v. 13 [the replacement of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962;</font> with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#966;&#941;&#961;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#957;</font> or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#966;&#941;&#961;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#957;</font>]; in v. 24 [insertion of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962; &#960;&#949;&#960;&#959;&#953;&#952;&#972;&#964;&#945;&#962; &#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#967;&#961;&#8053;&#956;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#957;</font>, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#955;&#959;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#959;&#957;</font>, or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8048; &#967;&#961;&#8053;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945; &#7956;&#967;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</font>; and perhaps in v. 2 [possible insertion of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#949;&#955;&#952;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962; &#934;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#945;&#8150;&#959;&#953;</font> or similar permutations].)

Mark&#8217;s inclusion of the statement <i>And if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery</i> (v. 12) reflects more the problem of the predominantly Gentile church in Rome to which he was writing. As such it may be an interpretive and parenthetical comment by the author rather than part of the saying by Jesus, which would stop at the end of v. 11. As such it should then be placed in parentheses. Further NT passages that deal with the issue of divorce and remarriage are Matt 5:31-32; 19:1-12; Luke 16:18; 1 Cor 7.</p>

It could be argued that the masculine pronoun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">autois</font>, &#8220;them&#8221;) only rarely was used with the neuter antecedent <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#953;&#948;&#943;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">paidia</font>, &#8220;children&#8221;), and thus the longer reading was not motivated by scribal clarification. However, such rare usage is found in Mark (cf. 5:41; 9:24-26); further, scribes routinely added clarifications when such were not necessary. Thus, both on external and internal grounds, the shorter reading is strongly preferred. Similar motivations are behind the translation here, namely, &#8220;those who brought them&#8221; has been supplied to ensure that the parents who brought the children are in view, not the children themselves.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the disciples scolded them.&#8221;</p>

The point is that it is impossible to attain to the kingdom by means of riches. The passage as a whole is found in the section 8:27-10:52 in which Mark has been focusing on Jesus&#8217; suffering and true discipleship. In vv. 28-31 Jesus does not deny great rewards to those who follow him, both in the present age and in the age to come, but it must be thoroughly understood that suffering will be integral to the mission of the disciples and the church, for in the very next section (10:32-34) Jesus reaffirmed the truth about his coming rejection, suffering, death, and resurrection. </p>
