<A NAME="122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=679><b>sn</b><i> </i>The <i>vineyard</i> is a figure for Israel in the OT (Isa 5:1-7). The nation and its leaders are the tenants, so the vineyard here may well refer to the promise that resides within the nation. The imagery is like that in Rom 11:11-24.</p>

The objects of the verbs &#8220;beat&#8221; and &#8220;sent away&#8221; have been supplied in the translation to conform to English style.

<A NAME="1211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=688><b>sn</b> The image of the <i>tenants</i> beating up the owner&#8217;s slave pictures the nation&#8217;s rejection of the prophets and their message.</p>
<A NAME="1212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=689><b>sn</b> The slaves being sent<i> empty-handed </i>suggests that the vineyard was not producing any fruit &#8211; and thus neither was the nation of Israel.</p>

<A NAME="1219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=696><b>sn</b> The statement that the owner will <i>come and destroy those tenants</i> is a promise of judgment; see Luke 13:34-35; 19:41-44.</p>

The use of Ps 118:22-23 and the &#8220;stone imagery&#8221; as a reference to Christ and his suffering and exaltation is common in the NT (see also Matt 21:42; Luke 20:17; Acts 4:11; 1 Pet 2:6-8; cf. also Eph 2:20). The irony in the use of Ps 118:22-23 in Mark 12:10-11 is that in the OT, Israel was the one rejected (or perhaps her king) by the Gentiles, but in the NT it is Jesus who is rejected by Israel.</p>
<A NAME="1222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=699><b>sn</b> A quotation from Ps 118:22-23.</p>

<A NAME="1225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=702><b>sn</b> The point of the parable in Mark 12:1-12 is that the leaders of the nation have been rejected by God and the <i>vineyard</i> (v. 9, referring to the nation and its privileged status) will be taken from them and given <i>to others</i> (an allusion to the Gentiles).</p>

<A NAME="1227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=704><b>sn</b> See the note on <i>Pharisees</i> in 2:16.</p>
<A NAME="1228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=705><b>sn</b> <i>Pharisees and Herodians</i> made a very interesting alliance. W. W. Wessel (&#8220;Mark,&#8221; <i>EBC </i>8:733) comments: &#8220;The Herodians were as obnoxious to the Pharisees on political grounds as the Sadducees were on theological grounds. Yet the two groups united in their opposition to Jesus. Collaboration in wickedness, as well as goodness, has great power. Their purpose was to trip Jesus up in his words so that he would lose the support of the people, leaving the way open for them to destroy him.&#8221; See also the note on &#8220;Herodians&#8221; in Mark 3:6.</p>
<A NAME="1229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=706><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;trap him in word.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="1231"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=708><b>sn</b> <i>Teach the way of God in accordance with the truth.</i> Very few comments are as deceitful as this one; they did not really believe this at all.

<A NAME="1233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=710><b>tn</b> According to L&amp;N 57.180 the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#8134;&#957;&#963;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">khnso&quot;</font>) was borrowed from Latin and referred to a poll tax, a tax paid by each adult male to the Roman government.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This question concerning <i>taxes</i> was specifically designed to trap Jesus. If he answered yes, then his opponents could publicly discredit him as a sympathizer with Rome. If he answered no, then they could go to the Roman governor and accuse Jesus of rebellion.</p>
<A NAME="1234"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=711><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the emperor&#8221; (&#8220;Caesar&#8221; is a title for the Roman emperor).</p>

<A NAME="1236"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=713><b>tn</b> Here the specific name of the coin was retained in the translation, because not all coins in circulation in Palestine at the time carried the image of Caesar. In other places <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#951;&#957;&#940;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">dhnarion</font>) has been translated simply as &#8220;silver coin&#8221; with an explanatory note.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> A<i> denarius </i>was a silver coin stamped with the image of the emperor and worth approximately one day&#8217;s wage for a laborer.</p>
<A NAME="1237"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=714><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> (<font face="Greektl">de</font>) has been translated as &#8220;so&#8221; to indicate their response to Jesus&#8217; request for a coin.</p>
<A NAME="1238"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=715><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;whose likeness.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> In this passage Jesus points to the <i>image </i>(<i>Grk</i> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#954;&#8061;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">eikwn</font>) of Caesar on the coin. This same Greek word is used in Gen 1:26 (LXX) to state that humanity is made in the &#8220;image&#8221; of God. Jesus is making a subtle yet powerful contrast: Caesar&#8217;s image is on the denarius, so he can lay claim to money through taxation, but God&#8217;s image is on humanity, so he can lay claim to each individual life.</p>
<A NAME="1239"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=716><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;they said to him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1240"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=717><b>sn</b> Jesus&#8217; answer to <i>give to Caesar the things that are Caesar&#8217;s, and to God the things that are God&#8217;s </i>was a both/and, not the questioners&#8217; either/or. So he slipped out of their trap.</p>
<A NAME="1241"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=718><b>sn</b> The<i> Sadducees </i>controlled the official political structures of Judaism at this time, being the majority members of the Sanhedrin. They were known as extremely strict on law and order issues (Josephus, <i>J.

<A NAME="1245"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=722><b>tn</b> The use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jina</font>) with imperatival force is unusual (BDF §470.1).</p>

<A NAME="1247"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=724><b>sn</b> A quotation from Deut 25:5. This practice is called levirate marriage (see also Ruth 4:1-12; Mishnah,<i> m. Yevamot; </i>Josephus<i>, Ant. </i>4.8.23 [4.254-256]). The levirate law is described in Deut 25:5-10. The brother of a man who died without a son had an obligation to marry his brother&#8217;s widow. This served several purposes: It provided for the widow in a society where a widow with no children to care for her would be reduced to begging, and it preserved the name of the deceased, who would be regarded as the legal father of the first son produced from that marriage.</p>
<A NAME="1248"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=725><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;took a wife&#8221; (an idiom for marrying a woman).</p>

The strong external pedigree of the shorter reading gives one pause. Nevertheless, the Alexandrian and other <sc>mss most likely dropped the words from the text either to conform the wording to the parallel in Matt 22:28 or because &#8220;when they rise again&#8221; was redundant. But the inclusion of these words is thoroughly compatible with Mark&#8217;s usually pleonastic style (see <i>TCGNT</i> 93), and therefore most probably authentic to Mark&#8217;s Gospel.</p>

<A NAME="1269"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">69</span><note=746><b>sn</b> It was a common belief in Judaism that Messiah would be <i>David&#8217;s son</i> in that he would come from the lineage of David.

The passage looks at an enthronement of this figure and a declaration of honor for him as he takes his place at the side of God. In Jerusalem, the king&#8217;s palace was located to the right of the temple to indicate this kind of relationship. Jesus was pressing the language here to get his opponents to reflect on how great Messiah is.</p>

But even in these passages the general sense of &#8216;treasury&#8217; is prob., for the contributions would go [into] the treasury via the receptacles.&#8221; Based upon the extra-biblical evidence (see <b>sn</b> following), however, the translation opts to refer to the actual receptacles and not the treasury itself.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The <i>offering box</i> probably refers to the receptacles in the temple forecourt by the Court of Women used to collect freewill offerings.

But whereas they evidenced no faith and actually stole money from God and men (cf. 11:17), she evidenced great faith and gave out of her extreme poverty <i>everything she had</i>. </p>
