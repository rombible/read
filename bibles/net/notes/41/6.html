<A NAME="62"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=314><b>sn</b> Jesus&#8217; <i>hometown</i> (where he spent his childhood years) was Nazareth, about 20 miles (30 km) southwest of Capernaum.</p>
<A NAME="63"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=315><b>sn</b> See the note on <i>synagogue </i>in 1:21. Jesus undoubtedly took the opportunity on this occasion to speak about his person and mission, and the relation of both to OT fulfillment.</p>

<A NAME="65"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=317><b>tc</b> Evidently because of the possible offensiveness of designating Jesus a carpenter, several <sc>mss ([<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>45vid</sup>] <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13</sup> 33<sup>vid</sup> [565 579] 700 [2542] <i>pc</i> it vg<sup>mss</sup>) harmonize the words &#8220;carpenter, the son&#8221; to the parallel passage in Matt 13:55, &#8220;the son of the carpenter.&#8221; Almost all the rest of the <sc>mss read &#8220;the carpenter, the son.&#8221; Since the explicit designation of Jesus as a carpenter is the more difficult reading, and is much better attested, it is most likely correct.</p>
<A NAME="66"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=318><b>sn</b> The reference to Jesus as <i>the carpenter</i> is probably derogatory, indicating that they knew Jesus only as a common laborer like themselves. The reference to him <i>as the son of Mary</i> (even though Jesus&#8217; father was probably dead by this point) appears to be somewhat derogatory, for a man was not regarded as his mother&#8217;s son in Jewish usage unless an insult was intended (cf. Judg 11:1-2; John 6:42; 8:41; 9:29).</p>
<A NAME="67"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=319><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And.&#8221; Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;then&#8221; to indicate the implied sequence of events within the narrative.</p>

<A NAME="610"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=322><b>sn</b> The phrase <i>unclean spirits </i>refers to evil spirits.</p>
<A NAME="611"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=323><b>sn</b> Neither Matt 10:9-10 nor Luke 9:3 allow for a staff. It might be that Matthew and Luke mean not taking an extra staff, or that the expression is merely rhetorical for &#8220;traveling light,&#8221; which has been rendered in two slightly different ways.</p>
<A NAME="612"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=324><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;no traveler&#8217;s bag&#8221;; or possibly &#8220;no beggar&#8217;s bag&#8221; (L&amp;N 6.145; BDAG 811 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#8053;&#961;&#945;</font>).</p>
<A NAME="613"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=325><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;shirts&#8221; (a long garment worn under the cloak next to the skin). The name for this garment (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#967;&#953;&#964;&#8061;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">citwn</font>) presents some difficulty in translation. Most modern readers would not understand what a &#8220;tunic&#8221; was any more than they would be familiar with a &#8220;<i>chiton</i>.&#8221; On the other hand, attempts to find a modern equivalent are also a problem: &#8220;Shirt&#8221; conveys the idea of a much shorter garment that covers only the upper body, and &#8220;undergarment&#8221; (given the styles of modern underwear) is more misleading still. &#8220;Tunic&#8221; was therefore employed, but with a note to explain its nature.</p>
<A NAME="614"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=326><b>sn</b> Jesus telling his disciples to <i>stay there</i> in one house contrasts with the practice of religious philosophers in the ancient world who went from house to house begging.</p>
<A NAME="615"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=327><b>sn</b> To <i>shake the dust off</i> represented shaking off the uncleanness from one&#8217;s feet; see Luke 10:11; Acts 13:51; 18:6. It was a sign of rejection.</p>

<A NAME="618"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=330><b>sn</b> Herod was technically not a <i>king</i>, but a tetrarch, a ruler with rank and authority lower than a king. A tetrarch ruled only with the approval of the Roman authorities. This was roughly equivalent to being governor of a region. In the NT, Herod, who ruled over Galilee, is called a king (Matt 14:9, Mark 6:14-29), reflecting popular usage rather than an official title.</p>
<A NAME="619"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=331><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;his&#8221;; the referent (Jesus) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>

<A NAME="622"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=334><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; here it is necessary to specify the referent as &#8220;Herod,&#8221; since the nearest previous antecedent in the translation is Philip.</p>
<A NAME="623"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=335><b>tn</b> The imperfect tense verb is here rendered with an iterative force.</p>
<A NAME="624"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=336><b>sn</b> <i>It is not lawful for you to have your brother&#8217;s wife. </i>This was a violation of OT law (Lev 18:16; 20:21). In addition, both Herod Antipas and Herodias had each left marriages to enter into this union.</p>

The variation may be no more than a simple case of confusion of letters, since the two readings look very much alike. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#959;&#953;&#941;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">poiew</font>, &#8220;I do&#8221;) certainly occurs more frequently than <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#961;&#941;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">aporew</font>, &#8220;I am at a loss&#8221;), so a scribe would be more likely to write a more familiar word. Further, even though the reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#960;&#959;&#943;&#949;&#953;</font> is the harder reading in terms of the sense, it is virtually nonsensical here, rendering it most likely an unintentional corruption.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;terribly disturbed,&#8221; &#8220;rather perplexed.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#961;&#941;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">aporew</font>) means &#8220;to be in perplexity, with the implication of serious anxiety&#8221; (L&amp;N 32.9).</p>

<A NAME="634"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=346><b>tc</b> Behind &#8220;his daughter Herodias&#8221; is a most difficult textual problem. The reading adopted in the translation, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8134;&#962; &#952;&#965;&#947;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#8190;&#919;&#961;&#8179;&#948;&#953;&#940;&#948;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">th&quot; qugatro&quot; aujtou Jerwdiado&quot;</font>), is supported by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B D L <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#916;</font> 565 <i>pc</i>; it is also the most difficult reading internally since it describes Herodias as Herod&#8217;s daughter. Other readings are less awkward, but they do not have adequate external support. The reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8134;&#962; &#952;&#965;&#947;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8134;&#962; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#8190;&#919;&#961;&#8179;&#948;&#953;&#940;&#948;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">th&quot; qugatro&quot; auth&quot; th&quot; &amp;erwdiado&quot;</font>, &#8220;the daughter of Herodias herself&#8221;) is supported by A C (W) <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13</sup> 33 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>, but this is also grammatically awkward. The easiest reading, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8134;&#962; &#952;&#965;&#947;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#8190;&#919;&#961;&#8179;&#948;&#953;&#940;&#948;&#959;&#962;</font> (&#8220;the daughter of Herodias&#8221;) is supported by <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1</sup> <i>pc</i>, but this reading probably arose from an accidental omission of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8134;&#962;</font> in the previous reading. The reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8134;&#962; &#952;&#965;&#947;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#8190;&#919;&#961;&#8179;&#948;&#953;&#940;&#948;&#959;&#962;</font>, despite its historical difficulties, is most likely original due to external attestation and the fact that it most likely gave rise to the other readings as scribes sought to correct it.</p>
<A NAME="635"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=347><b>tc</b> &#8225; The witnesses here support several different readings: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8135; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#940;</font> (<font face="Greektl">auth polla</font>, &#8220;to her insistently&#8221;) is found in D <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> 565 700 it; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#940;</font> is the reading of <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>45vid</sup> 28; both words are lacking in L <i>pc</i>; and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A B C<sup>2vid</sup> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13</sup> 33 2427 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat have just <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8135;</font>. The best candidates for authenticity, on external grounds, are <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8135; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#940;</font> and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8135;</font>. So the issue revolves around whether <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#940;</font> is part of the text. On the one hand, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#940;</font> used adverbially is a distinctive Markanism (10 of the 16 NT instances are found in Mark; of the other Gospels, Matthew alone adds a single example [Matt 9:14]). It could be argued that such an unremarkable term would go unnoticed by the scribes, and consequently would not have been inserted in imitation of Mark&#8217;s style observed elsewhere. On the other hand, the largest cluster of instances of an adverbial <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#940;</font> are in Mark 5-6, with the most recent example coming just three verses earlier (Mark 5:23, 38, 43; 6:20). Scribes may well have imitated the usage so recently and so frequently seen. Further, the best Alexandrian witnesses, as well as good representatives of the Western and Byzantines texts, lack <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#940;</font>. On the whole, though a decision is difficult, it is probably best to read the text without <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#940;</font>. NA<sup>27</sup> places the word in brackets, indicating some doubt as to its authenticity.</p>

On the other hand, just as weighty <sc>mss (A B L 33 2427 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>) have the words. Although a decision is not easy, the most satisfactory explanation seems to be that scribes were more prone to delete than to add the words here. They may have been puzzled as to why &#8220;the bread&#8221; should be mentioned without a corresponding mention of &#8220;fish.&#8221; Since neither Matt 14:21 or Luke 9:17 explicitly mention the bread, a desire for harmonization may have motivated the copyists as well. On the other hand, D and W are prone to longer, explanatory readings. Since they both lack the words here, it is likely that their archetypes also lacked the words. But given Mark&#8217;s pleonastic style, the good witnesses with &#8220;the bread,&#8221; and a reasonable explanation for the omission, &#8220;the bread&#8221; is most likely part of the original text of Mark.</p>

Exod 33:19, 22). According to the latter alternative, Jesus is &#8220;passing by&#8221; the disciples during their struggle, in order to assure them of his presence with them. See W L.
