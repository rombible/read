<A NAME="95"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=481><b>sn</b> To bear the cross means to accept the rejection of the world for turning to Jesus and following him. Discipleship involves a death that is like a crucifixion; see Gal 6:14.</p>

<A NAME="97"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=483><b>sn</b> The point of the saying <i>whoever wants to save his life will lose it</i> is that if one comes to Jesus then rejection by many will certainly follow. If self-protection is a key motivation, then one will not respond to Jesus and will not be saved. One who is willing to risk rejection will respond and find true life.</p>

<A NAME="910"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=486><b>sn</b> How one responds now to Jesus and his teaching is a reflection of how Jesus, as the Son of Man who judges, will respond then in the final judgment.</p>

BDAG 195 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#949;&#973;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953;</font> 2).</p>
<A NAME="914"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=490><b>sn</b> Several suggestions have been made as to the referent for the phrase <i>the kingdom of God come with power</i>: (1) the transfiguration itself, which immediately follows in the narrative; (2) Jesus&#8217; resurrection and ascension; (3) the coming of the Spirit; (4) Jesus&#8217; second coming and the establishment of the kingdom. The reference to <i>after six days</i> in 9:2 seems to indicate that Mark had the transfiguration in mind insofar as it was a substantial prefiguring of the consummation of the kingdom (although this interpretation is not without its problems). As such, the transfiguration was a tremendous confirmation to the disciples that even though Jesus had just finished speaking of his death (8:31; 9:31; 10:33), he was nonetheless the promised Messiah and things were proceeding according to God&#8217;s plan.</p>
<A NAME="915"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=491><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And after six days.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="916"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=492><b>sn</b> In 1st century Judaism and in the NT, there was the belief that the righteous get new, glorified bodies in order to enter heaven (1 Cor 15:42-49; 2 Cor 5:1-10). This transformation means the righteous will share the glory of God. One recalls the way Moses shared the Lord&#8217;s glory after his visit to the mountain in Exod 34. So the disciples saw Jesus <i>transfigured</i>, and they were getting a sneak preview of the great glory that Jesus would have (only his glory is more inherent to him as one who shares in the rule of the kingdom).</p>
<A NAME="917"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=493><b>sn</b> Commentators and scholars discuss why <i>Moses </i>and <i>Elijah </i>are present. The most likely explanation is that Moses represents the prophetic office (Acts 3:18-22) and Elijah pictures the presence of the last days (Mal 4:5-6), the prophet of the eschaton (the end times).</p>

It was actually a way of expressing honor to Jesus, but the next few verses make it clear that it was not enough honor.</p>

<A NAME="926"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=502><b>sn</b> The expression <i>listen to him </i>comes from Deut 18:15 and makes two points: 1) Jesus is a prophet like Moses, a leader-prophet, and 2) they have much yet to learn from him.</p>

The reading that best explains the rise of the others is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8056; &#949;&#7984; &#948;&#973;&#957;&#8131;</font>. The neuter article indicates that the Lord is now quoting the boy&#8217;s father who, in v. 22, says <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7988; &#964;&#953; &#948;&#973;&#957;&#8131;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ei ti dunh</font>, &#8220;if you are able to do anything&#8221;). The article is thus used anaphorically (see <i>ExSyn</i> 238). However, scribes could easily have overlooked this idiom and would consequently read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8056; &#949;&#7984; &#948;&#973;&#957;&#8131;</font> as the protasis of a conditional clause of the Lord&#8217;s statement. As such, it would almost demand the infinitive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#8166;&#963;&#945;&#953;</font>, producing the reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8056; &#949;&#7984; &#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#963;&#945;&#953; &#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#8166;&#963;&#945;&#953;</font> (&#8220;if you are able to believe, all things are possible&#8230;&#8221;). But the article here seems to be meaningless, prompting other scribes to modify the text still further. Some dropped the nonsensical article, while others turned it into the demonstrative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959;</font> and dropped the infinitive. It is clear that scribes had difficulty with the original wording here, and made adjustments in various directions. What might not be so clear is the exact genealogy of the descent of all the readings. However, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8056; &#949;&#7984; &#948;&#973;&#957;&#8131;</font> is both a hard saying, best explains the rise of the other readings, and is supported by the best witnesses. It thus rightly deserves to be considered authentic.</p>

However, because this can be taken as a specific reference to the group responsible for Jesus&#8217; arrest, where it is unlikely women were present (cf.

This was the valley along the south side of Jerusalem. In OT times it was used for human sacrifices to the pagan god Molech (cf. Jer 7:31; 19:5-6; 32:35), and it came to be used as a place where human excrement and rubbish were disposed of and burned. In the intertestamental period, it came to be used symbolically as the place of divine punishment (cf. <i>1 En.</i> 27:2, 90:26; <i>4 Ezra</i> 7:36). This Greek term also occurs in vv. 45, 47.</p>

At a later stage, copyists would either replace the text with this marginal note or add the note to the text. The longer reading thus seems to be the result of the conflation of the Alexandrian reading &#8220;salted with fire&#8221; and the Western reading &#8220;salted with salt.&#8221; The reading adopted by the text enjoys the best support and explains the other readings in the ms tradition. </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The statement <i>everyone will be salted with fire</i> is difficult to interpret. It may be a reference to (1) unbelievers who enter hell as punishment for rejection of Jesus, indicating that just as salt preserves so they will be preserved in their punishment in hell forever; (2) Christians who experience suffering in this world because of their attachment to Christ; (3) any person who experiences suffering in a way appropriate to their relationship to Jesus. For believers this means the suffering of purification, and for unbelievers it means hell, i.e., eternal torment. </p>
<A NAME="972"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">72</span><note=548><b>sn</b> <i>Salt</i> was used as seasoning or fertilizer (BDAG 41 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7941;&#955;&#945;&#962;</font> a), or as a preservative. If salt ceased to be useful, it was thrown away. With this illustration Jesus warned about a disciple who ceased to follow him.</p>
<A NAME="973"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">73</span><note=549><b>sn</b> The difficulty of this saying is understanding how <i>salt </i>could lose <i>its saltiness </i>since its chemical properties cannot change. It is thus often assumed that Jesus was referring to chemically impure salt, perhaps a natural salt which, when exposed to the elements, had all the genuine salt leached out, leaving only the sediment or impurities behind. Others have suggested the background of the saying is the use of salt blocks by Arab bakers to line the floor of their ovens: Under the intense heat these blocks would eventually crystallize and undergo a change in chemical composition, finally being thrown out as unserviceable. A saying in the Talmud (<i>b. Bekhorot </i>8b) attributed to R. Joshua ben Chananja (ca. <sc>a.d. 90), when asked the question &#8220;When salt loses its flavor, how can it be made salty again?&#8221; is said to have replied, &#8220;By salting it with the afterbirth of a mule.&#8221; He was then asked, &#8220;Then does the mule (being sterile) bear young?&#8221; to which he replied: &#8220;Can salt lose its flavor?&#8221; The point appears to be both are impossible. The saying, while admittedly late, suggests that culturally the loss of flavor by salt was regarded as an impossibility. Genuine salt can never lose its flavor. In this case the saying by Jesus here may be similar to Matt 19:24, where it is likewise impossible for the camel to go through the eye of a sewing needle.</p>
