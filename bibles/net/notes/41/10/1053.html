<A NAME="1053"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=602><b>sn</b> Note that Mark (see also Matt 19:29; Luke 10:25, 18:30) portrays <i>eternal life</i> as something one receives <i>in the age to come</i>, unlike John, who emphasizes the possibility of receiving eternal life in the present (John 5:24).</p>
