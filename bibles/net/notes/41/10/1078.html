<A NAME="1078"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">78</span><note=627><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;that I may see [again].&#8221; The phrase can be rendered as an imperative of request, &#8220;Please, give me sight.&#8221; Since the man is not noted as having been blind from birth (as the man in John 9 was) it is likely the request is to receive back the sight he once had.</p>
