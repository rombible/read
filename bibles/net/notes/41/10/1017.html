<A NAME="1017"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=566><b>sn</b><i> </i>It was not uncommon in Jesus&#8217; day for a Jewish man to divorce his wife, but it was extremely rare for a wife to initiate such an action against her husband, since among many things it would have probably left her destitute and without financial support. Mark&#8217;s inclusion of the statement <i>And if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery</i> (v. 12) reflects more the problem of the predominantly Gentile church in Rome to which he was writing. As such it may be an interpretive and parenthetical comment by the author rather than part of the saying by Jesus, which would stop at the end of v. 11. As such it should then be placed in parentheses. Further NT passages that deal with the issue of divorce and remarriage are Matt 5:31-32; 19:1-12; Luke 16:18; 1 Cor 7.</p>
