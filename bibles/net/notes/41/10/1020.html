Since the subject is not explicit in the earliest and best witnesses as well as several others (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B C L <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#916;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 579 892 2427), scribes would be prone to add &#8220;those who brought them&#8221; here to clarify that the children were not the ones being scolded. It could be argued that the masculine pronoun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">autois</font>, &#8220;them&#8221;) only rarely was used with the neuter antecedent <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#953;&#948;&#943;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">paidia</font>, &#8220;children&#8221;), and thus the longer reading was not motivated by scribal clarification. However, such rare usage is found in Mark (cf. 5:41; 9:24-26); further, scribes routinely added clarifications when such were not necessary. Thus, both on external and internal grounds, the shorter reading is strongly preferred. Similar motivations are behind the translation here, namely, &#8220;those who brought them&#8221; has been supplied to ensure that the parents who brought the children are in view, not the children themselves.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the disciples scolded them.&#8221;</p>
