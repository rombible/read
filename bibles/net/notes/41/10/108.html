<A NAME="108"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=557><b>tn</b> The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ei</font>) is often used to introduce both indirect and direct questions. Thus, another possible translation is to take this as an indirect question: &#8220;They asked him if it were lawful for a man to divorce his wife.&#8221; See BDF §440.3.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The question of the Pharisees was anything but sincere; they were asking it <i>to test him</i>. Jesus was now in the jurisdiction of Herod Antipas (i.e., Judea and beyond the Jordan) and it is likely that the Pharisees were hoping he might answer the question of divorce in a way similar to John the Baptist and so suffer the same fate as John, i.e., death at the hands of Herod (cf. 6:17-19). Jesus answered the question not on the basis of rabbinic custom and the debate over Deut 24:1, but rather from the account of creation and God&#8217;s original design.</p>
