<A NAME="1036"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=585><b>sn</b> The call for sacrifice comes with a promise of eternal reward: <i>You will have treasure in heaven</i>. Jesus&#8217; call is a test to see how responsive the man is to God&#8217;s direction through him. Will he walk the path God&#8217;s agent calls him to walk? For a rich person who got it right, see Zacchaeus in Luke 19:1-10.</p>
