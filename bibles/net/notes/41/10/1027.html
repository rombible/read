<A NAME="1027"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=576><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Jesus) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Mark 10:17-31. </i>The following unit, Mark 10:17-31, can be divided up into three related sections: (1) the rich man&#8217;s question (vv. 17-22); (2) Jesus&#8217; teaching on riches and the kingdom of God (vv. 23-27); and (3) Peter&#8217;s statement and Jesus&#8217; answer (vv. 28-31).<i> </i>They are all tied together around the larger theme of the relationship of wealth to the kingdom Jesus had been preaching. The point is that it is impossible to attain to the kingdom by means of riches. The passage as a whole is found in the section 8:27-10:52 in which Mark has been focusing on Jesus&#8217; suffering and true discipleship. In vv. 28-31 Jesus does not deny great rewards to those who follow him, both in the present age and in the age to come, but it must be thoroughly understood that suffering will be integral to the mission of the disciples and the church, for in the very next section (10:32-34) Jesus reaffirmed the truth about his coming rejection, suffering, death, and resurrection. </p>
