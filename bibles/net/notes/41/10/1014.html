<A NAME="1014"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=563><b>tc</b> &#8225; The earliest witnesses, as well as a few other important <sc>mss (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 892* 2427 sy<sup>s</sup>), lack the rest of the quotation from Gen 2:24, &#8220;and will be united with his wife.&#8221; Most <sc>mss ([A C] D [L N] W [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#916;</font>] <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>[1],13</sup> [579] <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat co) have the clause. It could be argued that the shorter reading was an accidental omission, due to this clause and v. 8 both beginning with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>, &#8220;and&#8221;). But if that were the case, one might expect to see corrections in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> or B. This can be overstated, of course; both <sc>mss combine in their errors on several other occasions. However, the nature of the omission here (both its length and the fact that it is from the OT) argues that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> and B reflect the original wording. Further, the form of the longer reading is identical with the LXX of Gen 2:24, but different from the quotation in Matt 19:5 (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#954;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#8053;&#963;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;</font> vs. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#8053;&#963;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;</font> [<font face="Greektl">proskollhqhsetai</font> vs. <font face="Greektl">kollhqhsetai</font>], <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#947;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#8150;&#954;&#945;</font> vs. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8135; &#947;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#953;&#954;&#943;</font> [<font face="Greektl">pro&quot; thn gunaika</font> vs. <font face="Greektl">th gunaiki</font>]). The significance of this is that Matthew&#8217;s quotations of the OT are often, if not usually, directly from the Hebrew &#8211; except when he is following Mark&#8217;s quotation of the OT. Matthew in fact only departs from Mark&#8217;s verbatim quotation of the LXX in 15:4 and 19:19, both texts quoting from Exod 20:12/Deut 5:6 (and in both places the only difference from Mark/LXX is the dropping of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#959;&#965;</font> [<font face="Greektl">sou</font>, &#8220;your&#8221;]). This might suggest that the longer reading here was not part of what the first evangelist had in his copy of Mark. Further, the reading without this line is harder, for the wife is not explicitly mentioned in v. 7; the casual reader could read &#8220;the two&#8221; of v. 8 as referring to father and mother rather than husband and wife. (And Mark is known for having harder, shorter readings that scribes tried to soften by explanatory expansion: In this chapter alone, cf. the textual problems in v. 6 [the insertion of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font>]; in v. 13 [the replacement of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962;</font> with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#966;&#941;&#961;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#957;</font> or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#966;&#941;&#961;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#957;</font>]; in v. 24 [insertion of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962; &#960;&#949;&#960;&#959;&#953;&#952;&#972;&#964;&#945;&#962; &#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#967;&#961;&#8053;&#956;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#957;</font>, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#955;&#959;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#959;&#957;</font>, or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8048; &#967;&#961;&#8053;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945; &#7956;&#967;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</font>; and perhaps in v. 2 [possible insertion of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#949;&#955;&#952;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962; &#934;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#945;&#8150;&#959;&#953;</font> or similar permutations].) Although a decision is difficult, the preferred reading lacks &#8220;and will be united with his wife.&#8221; NA<sup>27</sup> has the longer reading in brackets, indicating doubts as to its authenticity.</p>
