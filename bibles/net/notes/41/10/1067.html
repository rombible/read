<A NAME="1067"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=616><b>sn</b> The Greek word for <i>ransom</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#973;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">lutron</font>) is found here and in Matt 20:28 and refers to the payment of a price in order to purchase the freedom of a slave. The idea of Jesus as the &#8220;ransom&#8221; is that he paid the price with his own life by standing in humanity&#8217;s place as a substitute, enduring the judgment that was deserved for sin.</p>
