Such floating texts are usually signs of scribal emendations. The fact that the earliest and most reliable <sc>mss, as well as other important witnesses (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>45</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B L W <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#916;</font> 0274 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1 </sup>2427 co), lacked this material also strongly suggests that the longer reading is secondary. </p>
