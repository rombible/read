<A NAME="725"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=410><b>tc</b> Most <sc>mss, including early and important witnesses (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A B <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13</sup> 33 2427 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat), have here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#931;&#953;&#948;&#8182;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai Sidwno&quot;</font>, &#8220;and Sidon&#8221;). The Western text, as well as several other important <sc>mss (D L W <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#916;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> 28 565 it), lack the words. Although the external evidence is on the side of inclusion, it is difficult to explain why scribes would omit the mention of Sidon. On the other hand, the parallels in v. 31 and Matt 15:21 would be sufficient motivation for scribes to add Sidon here. Furthermore, every other mention of Tyre in the Gospels is accompanied by Sidon, putting pressure on scribes to conform this text as well. The shorter reading therefore, though without compelling external evidence on its side, is strongly supported by internal evidence, rendering judgment on its authenticity fairly certain.</p><p class="footnote"><b>map</b> For location see Map1-A2; Map2-G2; Map4-A1; JP3-F3; JP4-F3.</p>
