<A NAME="716"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=401><b>sn</b> <i>Corban </i>is a Hebrew loanword (transliterated in the Greek text and in most modern English translations) referring to something that has been set aside as a gift to be given to God at some later date, but which is still in the possession of the owner (L&amp;N 53.22). According to contemporary Jewish tradition the person who made this claim was absolved from responsibility to support or assist his parents, a clear violation of the Mosaic law to <i>honor</i> one&#8217;s parents (v. 10).</p>
