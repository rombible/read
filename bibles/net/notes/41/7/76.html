<A NAME="76"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=391><b>tc</b> Several important witnesses (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>45vid</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B L <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#916;</font> 28* <i>pc</i>) lack &#8220;and dining couches&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#954;&#955;&#953;&#957;&#8182;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">kai klinwn</font>), while the majority of <sc>mss (A D W <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13</sup> 33 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> latt) have the reading. Although normally the shorter reading is to be preferred, especially when it is backed by excellent witnesses as in this case, there are some good reasons to consider <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#954;&#955;&#953;&#957;&#8182;&#957;</font> as authentic: (1) Although the addition of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#955;&#953;&#957;&#8182;&#957;</font> could be seen as motivated by a general assimilation to the purity regulations in Lev 15 (as some have argued), there are three problems with such a supposition: (a) the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#955;&#943;&#957;&#951;</font> (<font face="Greektl">klinh</font>) does not occur in the LXX of Lev 15; (b) nowhere in Lev 15 is the <i>furniture</i> washed or sprinkled; and (c) the context of Lev 15 is about sexual impurity, while the most recent evidence suggests that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#955;&#943;&#957;&#951;</font> in Mark 7:4, in keeping with the other terms used here, refers to a dining couch (cf. BDAG 549 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#955;&#943;&#957;&#951;</font> 2). Thus, it is difficult to see <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#954;&#955;&#953;&#957;&#8182;&#957;</font> as a motivated reading. (2) <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#955;&#943;&#957;&#951;</font>, though a relatively rare term in the NT, is in keeping with Markan usage (cf. Mark 4:21; 7:30). (3) The phrase could have been dropped accidentally, at least in some cases, via homoioteleuton. (4) The phrase may have been deliberately expunged by some scribes who thought the imagery of washing a dining couch quite odd. The longer reading, in this case, can thus be argued as the harder reading. On balance, even though a decision is difficult (especially because of the weighty external evidence for the shorter reading), it is preferable to retain <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#954;&#955;&#953;&#957;&#8182;&#957;</font> in the text.</p>
