<A NAME="719"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=404><b>tc</b> Most later <sc>mss add <b>7:16</b> &#8220;Let anyone with ears to hear, listen.&#8221; This verse is included in A D W <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13</sup> 33 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> latt sy, but is lacking in important Alexandrian <sc>mss and a few others (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B L <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#916;</font>* 0274 28 2427). It appears to be a scribal gloss (see 4:9 and 4:23), perhaps introduced as a reiteration of the thought in 7:14, and is almost certainly not an original part of the Greek text of Mark. The present translation follows NA<sup>27</sup> in omitting the verse number, a procedure also followed by a number of other modern translations.</p>
