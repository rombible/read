<A NAME="76"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=391><b>tc</b> Several important witnesses (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>45vid</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B L <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#916;</font> 28* <i>pc</i>) lack &#8220;and dining couches&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#954;&#955;&#953;&#957;&#8182;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">kai klinwn</font>), while the majority of <sc>mss (A D W <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13</sup> 33 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> latt) have the reading. Although normally the shorter reading is to be preferred, especially when it is backed by excellent witnesses as in this case, there are some good reasons to consider <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#954;&#955;&#953;&#957;&#8182;&#957;</font> as authentic: (1) Although the addition of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#955;&#953;&#957;&#8182;&#957;</font> could be seen as motivated by a general assimilation to the purity regulations in Lev 15 (as some have argued), there are three problems with such a supposition: (a) the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#955;&#943;&#957;&#951;</font> (<font face="Greektl">klinh</font>) does not occur in the LXX of Lev 15; (b) nowhere in Lev 15 is the <i>furniture</i> washed or sprinkled; and (c) the context of Lev 15 is about sexual impurity, while the most recent evidence suggests that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#955;&#943;&#957;&#951;</font> in Mark 7:4, in keeping with the other terms used here, refers to a dining couch (cf. BDAG 549 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#955;&#943;&#957;&#951;</font> 2). Thus, it is difficult to see <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#954;&#955;&#953;&#957;&#8182;&#957;</font> as a motivated reading. (2) <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#955;&#943;&#957;&#951;</font>, though a relatively rare term in the NT, is in keeping with Markan usage (cf. Mark 4:21; 7:30). (3) The phrase could have been dropped accidentally, at least in some cases, via homoioteleuton. (4) The phrase may have been deliberately expunged by some scribes who thought the imagery of washing a dining couch quite odd. The longer reading, in this case, can thus be argued as the harder reading. On balance, even though a decision is difficult (especially because of the weighty external evidence for the shorter reading), it is preferable to retain <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#954;&#955;&#953;&#957;&#8182;&#957;</font> in the text.</p>
<A NAME="77"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=392><b>sn</b> Verses 3-4 represent parenthetical remarks by the author, giving background information.</p>

<A NAME="711"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=396><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;Having left the command.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="712"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=397><b>tc</b> The majority of <sc>mss, mostly Byzantine ([A] <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13</sup> 33 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>), have at the end of v. 8 material that seems to have come from v. 4 and v. 13: &#8220;the washing of pots and cups, and you do many other similar things.&#8221; A slight variation on the wording occurs at the very beginning of v. 8 in mostly Western witnesses (D <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> 0131<sup>vid</sup> 28 565 it). Such floating texts are usually signs of scribal emendations. The fact that the earliest and most reliable <sc>mss, as well as other important witnesses (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>45</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B L W <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#916;</font> 0274 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1 </sup>2427 co), lacked this material also strongly suggests that the longer reading is secondary. </p>
<A NAME="713"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=398><b>tc</b> The translation here follows the reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#964;&#8053;&#963;&#951;&#964;&#949;</font> (<font face="Greektl">sthshte</font>, &#8220;set up&#8221;) found in D W <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1 </sup>28 565 2542 it sy<sup>s,p</sup> Cyp. The majority of <sc>mss here read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#951;&#961;&#8053;&#963;&#951;&#964;&#949;</font> (<font face="Greektl">thrhsete</font>;<font face="Greektl"> </font><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A L <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13</sup> 33 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> co) or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#951;&#961;&#8134;&#964;&#949;</font> (<font face="Greektl">thrhte</font>; B 2427), both translated &#8220;keep.&#8221; It is hard to know which reading is best: On the one hand, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#951;&#961;&#8053;&#963;&#951;&#964;&#949;</font>/<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#951;&#961;&#8134;&#964;&#949;</font> has much stronger external support, but <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#964;&#8053;&#963;&#951;&#964;&#949;</font> is a more difficult reading. What makes &#8220;keep&#8221; suspect is that it appears in two different forms, suggesting independent alterations of a difficult reading. Further, scribes may have been influenced by the preceding &#8220;commandment of God&#8221; to change the text toward &#8220;keep&#8221; (<i>TCGNT</i> 81), a common enough expression (cf. Matt 19:17; John 14:15; 1 Tim 6:1; 1 John 5:3; Rev 14:12). Thus, the more difficult reading is &#8220;set up.&#8221; Also, the more natural opposite of &#8220;reject&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#952;&#949;&#8150;&#964;&#949;</font> [<font face="Greektl">aqeite</font>], literally &#8220;you set aside&#8221;) is &#8220;set up.&#8221; However, the Western reading may have been influenced by Exod 6:4 or Heb 10:9, but this likelihood seems remote. Thus, &#8220;set up&#8221; is more likely to be the original wording of Mark here.</p>
<A NAME="714"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=399><b>sn</b> A quotation from Exod 20:12; Deut 5:16.</p>
<A NAME="715"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=400><b>sn</b> A quotation from Exod 21:17; Lev 20:9.</p>
<A NAME="716"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=401><b>sn</b> <i>Corban </i>is a Hebrew loanword (transliterated in the Greek text and in most modern English translations) referring to something that has been set aside as a gift to be given to God at some later date, but which is still in the possession of the owner (L&amp;N 53.22). According to contemporary Jewish tradition the person who made this claim was absolved from responsibility to support or assist his parents, a clear violation of the Mosaic law to <i>honor</i> one&#8217;s parents (v. 10).</p>
<A NAME="717"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=402><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;nullifying.&#8221; This participle shows the results of the Pharisees&#8217; command.</p>
<A NAME="718"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=403><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And.&#8221; Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;then&#8221; to indicate the implied sequence of events within the narrative.</p>
<A NAME="719"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=404><b>tc</b> Most later <sc>mss add <b>7:16</b> &#8220;Let anyone with ears to hear, listen.&#8221; This verse is included in A D W <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13</sup> 33 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> latt sy, but is lacking in important Alexandrian <sc>mss and a few others (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B L <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#916;</font>* 0274 28 2427). It appears to be a scribal gloss (see 4:9 and 4:23), perhaps introduced as a reiteration of the thought in 7:14, and is almost certainly not an original part of the Greek text of Mark. The present translation follows NA<sup>27</sup> in omitting the verse number, a procedure also followed by a number of other modern translations.</p>
<A NAME="720"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=405><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And.&#8221; Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;now&#8221; to indicate the transition to a new topic.</p>

<A NAME="725"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=410><b>tc</b> Most <sc>mss, including early and important witnesses (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A B <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13</sup> 33 2427 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat), have here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#931;&#953;&#948;&#8182;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai Sidwno&quot;</font>, &#8220;and Sidon&#8221;). The Western text, as well as several other important <sc>mss (D L W <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#916;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> 28 565 it), lack the words. Although the external evidence is on the side of inclusion, it is difficult to explain why scribes would omit the mention of Sidon. On the other hand, the parallels in v. 31 and Matt 15:21 would be sufficient motivation for scribes to add Sidon here. Furthermore, every other mention of Tyre in the Gospels is accompanied by Sidon, putting pressure on scribes to conform this text as well. The shorter reading therefore, though without compelling external evidence on its side, is strongly supported by internal evidence, rendering judgment on its authenticity fairly certain.</p><p class="footnote"><b>map</b> For location see Map1-A2; Map2-G2; Map4-A1; JP3-F3; JP4-F3.</p>

The diminutive form originally referred to puppies or little dogs, then to house pets. In some Hellenistic uses <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kunarion</font>) simply means &#8220;dog.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The term <i>dogs</i> does not refer to wild dogs (scavenging animals roaming around the countryside) in this context, but to small dogs taken in as house pets. It is thus not a derogatory term per se, but is instead intended by Jesus to indicate the privileged position of the Jews (especially his disciples) as the initial recipients of Jesus&#8217; ministry. The woman&#8217;s response of faith and her willingness to accept whatever Jesus would offer pleased him to such an extent that he granted her request. This is the only miracle mentioned in Mark that Jesus performed at a distance without ever having seen the afflicted person, or issuing some sort of audible command.</p>
