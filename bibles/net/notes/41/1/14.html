<a name="14"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=4><b>tc</b> Instead of &#8220;in Isaiah the prophet&#8221; the majority of <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> read &#8220;in the prophets&#8221; (A W <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13</sup> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> Ir<sup>lat</sup>). Except for Irenaeus (2nd century), the earliest evidence for this is thus from the 5th (or possibly late 4th) century (W A). The difficulty of Irenaeus is that he wrote in Greek but has been preserved largely in Latin. His Greek remains have &#8220;in Isaiah the prophet.&#8221; Only the later Latin translation has &#8220;in the prophets.&#8221; The KJV reading is thus in harmony with the majority of <i>late</i> <span class="smallcaps">mss</span>. On the other hand, the witnesses for &#8220;in Isaiah the prophet&#8221; (either with the article before Isaiah or not) are early and geographically widespread: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B D L <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#916;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1</sup> 33 565 700 892 1241 2427 <i>al </i>sy<sup>p</sup> co Ir. This evidence runs deep into the 2nd century, is widespread, and is found in the most important Alexandrian, Western, and Caesarean witnesses. The &#8220;Isaiah&#8221; reading has a better external pedigree in every way. It has the support of the earliest and best witnesses from all the texttypes that matter. Moreover it is the harder reading, since the quotation in the first part of the verse appears to be from Exod 23:20 and Mal 3:1, with the quotation from Isa 40:3 coming in the next verse. The reading of the later <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> seems motivated by a desire to resolve this difficulty.</p>
