<a name="174"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">74</span><note=74><b>tc</b> The reading found in almost the entire NT ms tradition<i> </i>is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#960;&#955;&#945;&#947;&#967;&#957;&#953;&#963;&#952;&#949;&#943;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">splancnisqei&quot;</font>,<font face="Greektl"> </font>&#8220;moved with compassion&#8221;). Codex Bezae (D), {1358}, and a few Latin <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> (a ff<sup>2</sup> r<sup>1*</sup>) here read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8000;&#961;&#947;&#953;&#963;&#952;&#949;&#943;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ojrgisqei&quot;</font>, &#8220;moved with anger&#8221;). It is more difficult to account for a change from &#8220;moved with compassion&#8221; to &#8220;moved with anger&#8221; than it is for a copyist to soften &#8220;moved with anger&#8221; to &#8220;moved with compassion,&#8221; making the decision quite difficult. B. M. Metzger (<i>TCGNT</i> 65) suggests that &#8220;moved with anger&#8221; could have been prompted by 1:43, &#8220;Jesus sent the man away with a very strong warning.&#8221; It also could have been prompted by the man&#8217;s seeming doubt about Jesus&#8217; desire to heal him (v. 40). As well, it is difficult to explain why scribes would be prone to soften the text here but not in Mark 3:5 or 10:14 (where Jesus is also said to be angry or indignant). Thus, in light of diverse <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> supporting &#8220;moved with compassion,&#8221; and at least a plausible explanation for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8000;&#961;&#947;&#953;&#963;&#952;&#949;&#943;&#962;</font> as arising from the other reading, it is perhaps best to adopt <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#960;&#955;&#945;&#947;&#967;&#957;&#953;&#963;&#952;&#949;&#943;&#962;</font> as the original reading. Nevertheless, a decision in this case is not easy. For the best arguments for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8000;&#961;&#947;&#953;&#963;&#952;&#949;&#943;&#962;</font>, however, see M. A. Proctor, &#8220;The &#8216;Western&#8217; Text of Mark 1:41: A Case for the Angry Jesus&#8221; (Ph.D. diss., Baylor University, 1999).</p>
