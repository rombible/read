<a name="111"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=11><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And the whole Judean countryside.&#8221; Mark uses the Greek conjunction <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) at numerous places in his Gospel to begin sentences and paragraphs. This practice is due to Semitic influence and reflects in many cases the use of the Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font> (<i>vav</i>) which is used in OT narrative, much as it is here, to carry the narrative along. Because in contemporary English style it is not acceptable to begin every sentence with &#8220;and,&#8221; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> was often left untranslated or rendered as &#8220;now,&#8221; &#8220;so,&#8221; &#8220;then,&#8221; or &#8220;but&#8221; depending on the context. When left untranslated it has not been noted. When given an alternative translation, this is usually indicated by a note. </p>
