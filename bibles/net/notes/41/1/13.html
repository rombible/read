Most likely, the words were omitted by accident in some witnesses, since the last four words of v. 1, in uncial script, would have looked like this: <font face="Greek Uncials">iu_c_r_u_u_u_q_u_</font>. With all the successive <i>upsilons</i> an accidental deletion is likely. Further, the inclusion of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#965;&#7985;&#959;&#8166; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font> here finds its complement in 15:39, where the centurion claims that Jesus was <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#965;&#7985;&#8056;&#962; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Juios qeou</font>, &#8220;son of God&#8221;). Even though <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> is in general one of the best NT <span class="smallcaps">mss</span>, its testimony is not quite as preeminent in this situation. There are several other instances in which it breaks up chains of genitives ending in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#965;</font> (cf., e.g., Acts 28:31; Col 2:2; Heb 12:2; Rev 12:14; 15:7; 22:1), showing that there is a significantly higher possibility of accidental scribal omission in a case like this. This christological <i>inclusio</i> parallels both Matthew (&#8220;Immanuel&#8230;God with us&#8221; in 1:23/&#8220;I am with you&#8221; in 28:20) and John (&#8220;the Word was God&#8221; in 1:1/&#8220;My Lord and my God&#8221; in 20:28), probably reflecting nascent christological development and articulation.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The first verse of Mark&#8217;s Gospel appears to function as a title: <i>The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God</i>. It is not certain, however, whether Mark intended it to refer to the entire Gospel, to the ministry of John the Baptist, or through the use of the term <i>beginning</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8053;</font>, <font face="Greektl">arch</font>) to allude to Genesis 1:1 (in the Greek Bible, LXX). The most likely option is that the statement as a whole is an allusion to Genesis 1:1 and that Mark is saying that with the &#8220;good news&#8221; of the coming of Christ, God is commencing a &#8220;new beginning.&#8221; </p>
