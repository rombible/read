<a name="137"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=37><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;a boat.&#8221; The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#8183; &#960;&#955;&#959;&#943;&#8179;</font> (<font face="Greektl">en tw ploiw</font>) can either refer to a generic boat, some boat (as it seems to do in Matt 4:21); or it can refer to &#8220;their&#8221; boat, implying possession. Mark assumes a certain preunderstanding on the part of his readers about the first four disciples and hence the translation &#8220;their boat&#8221; is justified (cf. also v. 20 in which the &#8220;hired men&#8221; indicates that Zebedee&#8217;s family owned the boats). </p>
