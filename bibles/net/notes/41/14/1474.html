<A NAME="1474"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">74</span><note=883><b>sn</b> The statement <i>he ran off naked </i>is probably a reference to Mark himself, traditionally assumed to be the author of this Gospel. Why he was wearing only an outer garment and not the customary tunic as well is not mentioned. W. L. Lane, <i>Mark</i> (NICNT)<i>, </i>527-28, says that Mark probably mentioned this episode so as to make it clear that &#8220;<i>all</i> fled, leaving Jesus alone in the custody of the police.&#8221;</p>
