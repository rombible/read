<A NAME="1427"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=836><b>sn</b> This required getting a suitable lamb and finding lodging in Jerusalem where the meal could be eaten. The population of the city swelled during the feast, so lodging could be difficult to find. The <i>Passover</i> was celebrated each year in commemoration of the Israelites&#8217; deliverance from Egypt; thus it was a feast celebrating redemption (see Exod 12). The Passover lamb was roasted and eaten after sunset in a family group of at least ten people (<i>m. Pesahim </i>7.13). People ate the meal while reclining (see the note on <i>table</i> in 14:18). It included, besides the lamb, unleavened bread and bitter herbs as a reminder of Israel&#8217;s bitter affliction at the hands of the Egyptians. Four cups of wine mixed with water were also used for the meal. For a further description of the meal and the significance of the wine cups, see E. Ferguson, <i>Backgrounds of Early Christianity, </i>523-24.</p>
