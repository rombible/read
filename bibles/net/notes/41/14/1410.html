<A NAME="1410"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=819><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;expensive&#8221; is not in the Greek text but has been included to suggest a connection to the lengthy phrase &#8220;costly aromatic oil from pure nard&#8221; occurring earlier in v. 3. The author of Mark shortened this long phrase to just one word in Greek when repeated here, and the phrase &#8220;expensive ointment&#8221; used in the translation is intended as an abbreviated paraphrase.</p>
