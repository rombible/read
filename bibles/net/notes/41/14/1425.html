<A NAME="1425"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=834><b>sn</b> Generally <i>the feast of Unleavened Bread</i> would refer to Nisan 15 (Friday), but the following reference to the sacrifice of the <i>Passover</i> lamb indicates that Nisan 14 (Thursday) was what Mark had in mind (Nisan = March 27 to April 25). The celebration of the Feast of Unleavened Bread lasted eight days, beginning with the Passover meal. The celebrations were so close together that at times the names of both were used interchangeably.</p>
