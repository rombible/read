<A NAME="1457"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=866><b>tc</b> Codex D (with some support with minor variation from W <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13</sup> 565 2542 <i>pc</i> it) reads, &#8220;Enough of that! It is the end and the hour has come.&#8221; Evidently, this addition highlights Jesus&#8217; assertion that what he had predicted about his own death was now coming true (cf. Luke 22:37). Even though the addition highlights the accuracy of Jesus&#8217; prediction, it should not be regarded as part of the text of Mark, since it receives little support from the rest of the witnesses and because D especially is prone to expand the wording of a text.</p>
