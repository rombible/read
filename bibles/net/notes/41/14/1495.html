<A NAME="1495"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">95</span><note=904><b>tc</b> Several important witnesses (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B L W <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font>* 579 892 2427 <i>pc</i>) lack the words &#8220;and a rooster crowed.&#8221; The fact that such good and early Alexandrian witnesses lack these words makes this textual problem difficult to decide, especially because the words receive support from other witnesses, some of which are fairly decent (A C D <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font><sup>c</sup> 067 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13</sup> 33 [1424] <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font><i> </i>lat). The omission could have been intentional on the part of some Alexandrian scribes who wished to bring this text in line with the other Gospel accounts that only mention a rooster crowing once (Matt 26:74; Luke 22:60; John 18:27). The insertion could be an attempt to make the fulfillment of Jesus&#8217; prophecy in 14:30 more explicit. Internally, the words &#8220;and a rooster crowed&#8221; fit Mark&#8217;s Gospel here, not only in view of 14:30, &#8220;before a rooster crows twice,&#8221; but also in view of the mention of &#8220;a second time&#8221; in 14:71 (a reading which is much more textually secure). Nevertheless, a decision is difficult.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> A real rooster crowing is probably in view here (rather than the Roman trumpet call known as <i>gallicinium</i>), in part due to the fact that Mark mentions the rooster crowing twice. See the discussion at Matt 26:74.</p>
