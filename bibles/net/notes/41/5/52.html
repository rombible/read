Matthew 8:28 records this miracle as occurring &#8220;in the region of the Gadarenes.&#8221; &#8220;Irrespective of how one settles this issue, for the [second and] Third Evangelist the chief concern is that Jesus has crossed over into Gentile territory, &#8216;opposite Galilee&#8217;&#8221; (J. B. Green, <i>Luke </i>[NICNT], 337). The region of Gadara extended to the Sea of Galilee and included the town of Sennabris on the southern shore &#8211; the town that the herdsmen most likely entered after the drowning of the pigs.</p>
