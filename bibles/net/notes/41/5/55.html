<A NAME="55"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=263><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;met him from the tombs a man with an unclean spirit.&#8221; When this is converted to normal English word order (&#8220;a man met him from the tombs with an unclean spirit&#8221;) it sounds as if &#8220;with an unclean spirit&#8221; modifies &#8220;the tombs.&#8221; Likewise, &#8220;a man with an unclean spirit from the tombs met him&#8221; implies that the unclean spirit came from the tombs, while the Greek text is clear that it is the man who had the unclean spirit who came from the tombs. To make this clear a second verb, &#8220;came,&#8221; is supplied in English: &#8220;came from the tombs and met him.&#8221;</p>
