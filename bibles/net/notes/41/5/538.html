<A NAME="538"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=296><b>sn</b> This story of the woman <i>who had been suffering from hemorrhages for twelve years</i> is recounted in the middle of the story about Jairus&#8217; daughter. Mark&#8217;s account (as is often the case) is longer and more detailed than the parallel accounts in Matt 9:18-26 and Luke 8:40-56. Mark&#8217;s fuller account may be intended to show that the healing of the woman was an anticipation of the healing of the little girl.</p>
