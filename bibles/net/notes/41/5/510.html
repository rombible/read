<A NAME="510"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=268><b>sn</b> Though it seems unusual for a demon to invoke God&#8217;s name (<i>&#8220;I implore you by God&#8221;</i>) in his demands of Jesus, the parallel in Matt 8:29 suggests the reason: &#8220;Why have you come to torment us before the time?&#8221; There was an appointed time in which demons would face their judgment, and they seem to have viewed Jesus&#8217; arrival on the scene as an illegitimate change in God&#8217;s plan regarding the time when their sentence would be executed.</p>
