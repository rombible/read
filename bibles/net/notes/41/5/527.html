<A NAME="527"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=285><b>sn</b> Jesus instructs the man to declare <i>what the Lord has done</i> for him, in contrast to the usual instructions (e.g., 1:44; 5:43) to remain silent. Here in Gentile territory Jesus allowed more open discussion of his ministry. D. L. Bock (<i>Luke</i> [BECNT], 1:781) suggests that with few Jewish religious representatives present, there would be less danger of misunderstanding Jesus&#8217; ministry as political.</p>
