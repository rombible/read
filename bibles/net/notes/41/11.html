<A NAME="113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=631><b>sn</b> The exact location of the village of <i>Bethphage </i>is not known. Most put it on the southeast side of the Mount of Olives and northwest of Bethany, about 1.5 miles (3 km) east of Jerusalem.</p>
<A NAME="114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=632><b>sn</b> &#8220;Mountain&#8221; in English generally denotes a higher elevation than it often does in reference to places in Palestine. The <i>Mount of Olives</i> is really a ridge running north to south about 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) long, east of Jerusalem across the Kidron Valley. Its central elevation is about 30 meters (100 ft) higher than Jerusalem. It was named for the large number of olive trees which grew on it.</p>

In words familiar to every Jew, the author is indicating that at this point every messianic expectation is now at the point of realization. It is clear from the words of the psalm shouted by the crowd that Jesus is being proclaimed as messianic king. See E. Lohse, <i>TDNT</i> 9:682-84.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Hosanna</i> is an Aramaic expression that literally means, &#8220;help, I pray,&#8221; or &#8220;save, I pray.&#8221; By Jesus&#8217; time it had become a strictly liturgical formula of praise, however, and was used as an exclamation of praise to God.</p>
<A NAME="1115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=643><b>sn</b> A quotation from Ps 118:25-26.</p>

<A NAME="1119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=647><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;anything.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1120"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=648><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;And answering, he said to it.&#8221; The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#953;&#952;&#949;&#943;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">apokriqeis</font>) is redundant and has not been translated.</p>
<A NAME="1121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=649><b>sn</b> <i>Mark 11:12<b>-</b>14.</i> The incident of the cursing of the fig tree occurs before he enters the temple for a third time (11:27ff) and is questioned at length by the religious leaders (11:27-12:40). It appears that Mark records the incident as a portent of what is going to happen to the leadership in Jerusalem who were supposed to have borne spiritual fruit but have been found by Messiah at his coming to be barren. The fact that the nation as a whole is indicted is made explicit in chapter 13:1-37 where Jesus speaks of Jerusalem&#8217;s destruction and his second coming.</p>
<A NAME="1122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=650><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;then&#8221; to indicate the implied sequence of events within the narrative.</p>
<A NAME="1123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=651><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
<A NAME="1124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=652><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;He&#8221;; the referent (Jesus) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=653><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the temple.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The merchants (<i>those who were selling</i>) would have been located in the Court of the Gentiles.</p>
<A NAME="1126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=654><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;the temple.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Matthew (21:12-27), Mark (here, 11:15-19), and Luke (19:45-46) record this incident of the temple cleansing at the end of Jesus&#8217; ministry. John (2:13-16) records a cleansing of the temple at the beginning of Jesus&#8217; ministry. See the note on the word <i>temple courts</i> in John 2:14 for a discussion of the relationship of these accounts to one another.</p>
<A NAME="1127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=655><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;things.&#8221; The Greek word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#954;&#949;&#8166;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">skeuos</font>) can refer to merchandise, property, goods, a vessel, or even generally &#8220;things&#8221; (but in the sense of some implement or tool). The idea here is almost certainly restricted to merchandise, rather than the more general &#8220;things,&#8221; although some suggest from the parallel with <i>m. Berakhot</i> 9.5 that Jesus was not even allowing sandals, staffs, or coin-purses to be carried through the court. The difficulty with this interpretation, however, is that it is fundamentally an appeal to Jewish oral <i>tradition</i> (something Jesus rarely sided with) as well as being indiscriminate toward all the worshipers.</p>
<A NAME="1128"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=656><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the temple.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=657><b>tn</b> The imperfect <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#948;&#943;&#948;&#945;&#963;&#954;&#949;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">edidasken</font>) is here taken ingressively.</p>
<A NAME="1130"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=658><b>sn</b> A quotation from Isa 56:7.</p>
<A NAME="1131"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=659><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;a hideout&#8221; (see L&amp;N 1.57).</p>
<A NAME="1132"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=660><b>sn</b> A quotation from Jer 7:11. The meaning of Jesus&#8217; statement about making the temple courts <i>a den of robbers</i> probably operates here at two levels. Not only were the religious leaders robbing the people financially, but because of this they had also robbed them spiritually by stealing from them the opportunity to come to know God genuinely. It is possible that these merchants had recently been moved to this location for convenience.</p>
<A NAME="1133"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=661><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;The chief priests and the scribes.&#8221; See the note on the phrase &#8220;experts in the law&#8221; in 1:22.</p>
<A NAME="1134"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=662><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;how they could destroy him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1135"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=663><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;they&#8221;; the referents (Jesus and his disciples) have been specified in the translation for clarity. Without such clarification there is room for considerable confusion here, since there are two prior sets of plural referents in the context, &#8220;the chief priests and experts in the law&#8221; and &#8220;the whole crowd&#8221; (both in v. 18). </p>
<A NAME="1136"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=664><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Truly (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">amhn</font>), I say to you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1137"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=665><b>tn</b> Although the Greek subjunctive mood, formally required in a subordinate clause introduced by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">{ina</font>), is traditionally translated by an English subjunctive (e.g., &#8220;may,&#8221; so KJV, NAB, NIV, NRSV), changes in the use of the subjunctive in English now result in most readers understanding such a statement as indicating permission (&#8220;may&#8221; = &#8220;has permission to&#8221;) or as indicating uncertainty (&#8220;may&#8221; = &#8220;might&#8221; or &#8220;may or may not&#8221;). Thus a number of more recent translations render such instances by an English future tense (&#8220;will,&#8221; so TEV, CEV, NLT, NASB 1995 update). That approach has been followed here.</p>
<A NAME="1138"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=666><b>tc</b> A number of significant <sc>mss of various texttypes (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B L W <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#916;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 565 700 892 <i>pc</i> sa) do not include <b>11:26</b> &#8220;But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father in heaven forgive your sins.&#8221; The verse is included in most later <sc>mss (A [C D] <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> [<font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13</sup> 33] <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat) and is not likely to be original. It is probably an assimilation to Matt 6:15. The present translation follows NA<sup>27</sup> in omitting the verse number, a procedure also followed by a number of other modern translations.</p>
<A NAME="1139"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=667><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
<A NAME="1140"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=668><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Jesus) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1141"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=669><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the temple.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1142"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=670><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the chief priests, the scribes.&#8221; See the note on the phrase &#8220;experts in the law&#8221; in 1:22.</p>
<A NAME="1143"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=671><b>tn</b> On this phrase, see BDAG 844 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#959;&#8150;&#959;&#962;</font> 2.a.<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;</font>.</p>
<A NAME="1144"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=672><b>tn</b> The plural Greek term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#8061;&#960;&#969;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anqrwpwn</font>) is probably used here (and in v. 32) in a generic sense, referring to both men and women (cf. NAB, NRSV, &#8220;of human origin&#8221;; TEV, &#8220;from human beings&#8221;; NLT, &#8220;merely human&#8221;).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The question is whether John&#8217;s ministry was of divine or human origin.</p>
<A NAME="1145"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=673><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;so&#8221; to indicate the implied result of previous action(s) in the narrative.</p>
<A NAME="1146"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=674><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;answering, they said to Jesus.&#8221; The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#953;&#952;&#941;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">apokriqentes</font>) is redundant, but the syntax of the phrase has been modified to conform to English style.</p>
<A NAME="1147"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=675><b>sn</b> Very few questions could have so completely revealed the wicked intentions of the religious leaders. Jesus&#8217; question revealed the motivation of the religious leaders and exposed them for what they really were &#8211; hypocrites. They indicted themselves when they cited only two options and chose neither of them (&#8220;<i>We do not know</i>&#8221;). The point of Mark 11:27-33 is that no matter what Jesus said in response to their question they were not going to believe it and would in the end use it against him. </p>
<A NAME="1148"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=676><b>sn</b> <i>Neither will I tell you. </i>Though Jesus gave no answer, the analogy he used to their own question makes his view clear. His authority came from heaven.</p>
<A NAME="1149"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=677><b>tn</b> On this phrase, see BDAG 844 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#959;&#8150;&#959;&#962;</font> 2.a.<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;</font>. This is exactly the same phrase as in v. 28.</p>
