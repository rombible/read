<a name="11"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1><b>sn</b> By the time Mark wrote, the word <i>gospel</i> had become a technical term referring to the preaching about Jesus Christ and God&#8217;s saving power accomplished through him for all who believe (cf. Rom 1:16). </p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2><b>tn</b> The genitive in the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#949;&#8016;&#945;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#943;&#959;&#965; &#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">tou euangeliou Ihsou Cristou</font>, &#8220;the gospel of Jesus Christ&#8221;) could be translated as either a subjective genitive (&#8220;the gospel which Jesus brings [or proclaims]&#8221;) or an objective genitive (&#8220;the gospel about Jesus Christ&#8221;). Either is grammatically possible. This is possibly an instance of a plenary genitive (see <i>ExSyn</i> 119-21; M. Zerwick, <i>Biblical Greek</i>, §§36-39). If so, an interplay between the two concepts is intended: The gospel which Jesus proclaims is in fact the gospel about himself.</p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=3><b>tc</b> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> 28 <i>l</i>2211 <i>pc</i> sa<sup>ms </sup>Or lack <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#965;&#7985;&#959;&#8166; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Juiou qeou</font>, &#8220;son of God&#8221;), while virtually all the rest of the witnesses have the words (A <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13</sup> 33 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> also have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#8166;</font> [<font face="Greektl">tou</font>] before <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font>), so the evidence seems to argue for the authenticity of the words. Most likely, the words were omitted by accident in some witnesses, since the last four words of v. 1, in uncial script, would have looked like this: <font face="Greek Uncials">iu_c_r_u_u_u_q_u_</font>. With all the successive <i>upsilons</i> an accidental deletion is likely. Further, the inclusion of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#965;&#7985;&#959;&#8166; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font> here finds its complement in 15:39, where the centurion claims that Jesus was <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#965;&#7985;&#8056;&#962; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Juios qeou</font>, &#8220;son of God&#8221;). Even though <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> is in general one of the best NT <span class="smallcaps">mss</span>, its testimony is not quite as preeminent in this situation. There are several other instances in which it breaks up chains of genitives ending in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#965;</font> (cf., e.g., Acts 28:31; Col 2:2; Heb 12:2; Rev 12:14; 15:7; 22:1), showing that there is a significantly higher possibility of accidental scribal omission in a case like this. This christological <i>inclusio</i> parallels both Matthew (&#8220;Immanuel&#8230;God with us&#8221; in 1:23/&#8220;I am with you&#8221; in 28:20) and John (&#8220;the Word was God&#8221; in 1:1/&#8220;My Lord and my God&#8221; in 20:28), probably reflecting nascent christological development and articulation.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The first verse of Mark&#8217;s Gospel appears to function as a title: <i>The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God</i>. It is not certain, however, whether Mark intended it to refer to the entire Gospel, to the ministry of John the Baptist, or through the use of the term <i>beginning</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8053;</font>, <font face="Greektl">arch</font>) to allude to Genesis 1:1 (in the Greek Bible, LXX). The most likely option is that the statement as a whole is an allusion to Genesis 1:1 and that Mark is saying that with the &#8220;good news&#8221; of the coming of Christ, God is commencing a &#8220;new beginning.&#8221; </p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=4><b>tc</b> Instead of &#8220;in Isaiah the prophet&#8221; the majority of <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> read &#8220;in the prophets&#8221; (A W <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13</sup> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> Ir<sup>lat</sup>). Except for Irenaeus (2nd century), the earliest evidence for this is thus from the 5th (or possibly late 4th) century (W A). The difficulty of Irenaeus is that he wrote in Greek but has been preserved largely in Latin. His Greek remains have &#8220;in Isaiah the prophet.&#8221; Only the later Latin translation has &#8220;in the prophets.&#8221; The KJV reading is thus in harmony with the majority of <i>late</i> <span class="smallcaps">mss</span>. On the other hand, the witnesses for &#8220;in Isaiah the prophet&#8221; (either with the article before Isaiah or not) are early and geographically widespread: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B D L <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#916;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1</sup> 33 565 700 892 1241 2427 <i>al </i>sy<sup>p</sup> co Ir. This evidence runs deep into the 2nd century, is widespread, and is found in the most important Alexandrian, Western, and Caesarean witnesses. The &#8220;Isaiah&#8221; reading has a better external pedigree in every way. It has the support of the earliest and best witnesses from all the texttypes that matter. Moreover it is the harder reading, since the quotation in the first part of the verse appears to be from Exod 23:20 and Mal 3:1, with the quotation from Isa 40:3 coming in the next verse. The reading of the later <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> seems motivated by a desire to resolve this difficulty.</p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=5><b>sn</b> The opening lines of the quotation are from Exod 23:20; Mal 3:1. Here is the forerunner who points the way to the arrival of God&#8217;s salvation. His job is to prepare and guide the people, as the cloud did for Israel in the desert.</p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=6><b>sn</b> This call to &#8220;make his paths straight&#8221; in this context is probably an allusion to preparation through repentance.</p>

<a name="19"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=9><b>tn</b> While Matthew and Luke consistently use the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#946;&#945;&#960;&#964;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#951;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">baptisths</font>, &#8220;[the] Baptist&#8221;) to refer to John, as a kind of a title, Mark prefers the substantival participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#946;&#945;&#960;&#964;&#943;&#950;&#969;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jo baptizwn</font>, &#8220;the one who baptizes, the baptizer&#8221;) to describe him (only twice does he use the noun [Mark 6:25; 8:28]).</p>
<a name="110"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=10><b>sn</b> <i>A baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins</i> was a call for preparation for the arrival of the Lord&#8217;s salvation. To participate in this baptism was a recognition of the need for God&#8217;s forgiveness with a sense that one needed to live differently as a response to it.</p>
<a name="111"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=11><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And the whole Judean countryside.&#8221; Mark uses the Greek conjunction <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) at numerous places in his Gospel to begin sentences and paragraphs. This practice is due to Semitic influence and reflects in many cases the use of the Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font> (<i>vav</i>) which is used in OT narrative, much as it is here, to carry the narrative along. Because in contemporary English style it is not acceptable to begin every sentence with &#8220;and,&#8221; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> was often left untranslated or rendered as &#8220;now,&#8221; &#8220;so,&#8221; &#8220;then,&#8221; or &#8220;but&#8221; depending on the context. When left untranslated it has not been noted. When given an alternative translation, this is usually indicated by a note. </p>

While his clothing and diet were indicative of someone who lived in the desert, they also depicted him in his role as God&#8217;s prophet (cf. Zech 13:4); his appearance is similar to the Prophet Elijah (2 Kgs 1:8). <i>Locusts</i> <i>and wild honey</i> were a common diet in desert regions and locusts (dried insects) are listed in Lev 11:22 among the &#8220;clean&#8221; foods. </p>

Rom 1:1; 15:16; 2 Cor 11:7; 1 Thess 2:2, 8, 9; 1 Pet 4:17). On the other hand, this expression, &#8220;the gospel of God,&#8221; occurs nowhere else in the Gospels, while &#8220;the gospel of the kingdom&#8221; is a Matthean expression (Matt 4:23; 9:35; 24:14), and &#8220;kingdom of God&#8221; is pervasive in the synoptic Gospels (occurring over 50 times). Scribes would thus be more prone to add <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8134;&#962; &#946;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#955;&#949;&#943;&#945;&#962;</font> than to omit it. Further, the external support for the shorter reading (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B L <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13</sup> 28* 33 565 579 892 2427 sa) is significantly stronger than that for the longer reading. There is little doubt, therefore, that the shorter reading is authentic.</p>
<a name="131"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=31><b>tn</b> The genitive in the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8056; &#949;&#8016;&#945;&#947;&#947;&#941;&#955;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">to euangelion tou qeou</font>, &#8220;the gospel of God&#8221;) could be translated as either a subjective genitive (&#8220;the gospel which God brings&#8221;) or an objective genitive (&#8220;the gospel about God&#8221;).

The occupation of fisherman was labor-intensive. The imagery of using a lure and a line (and waiting for the fish to strike) is thus foreign to this text. Rather, the imagery of a fisherman involved much strain, long hours, and often little results. Jesus&#8217; point may have been one or more of the following: the strenuousness of evangelism, the work ethic that it required, persistence and dedication to the task (often in spite of minimal results), the infinite value of the new &#8220;catch&#8221; (viz., people), and perhaps an eschatological theme of snatching people from judgment (cf. W. L. Lane, <i>Mark</i> [NICNT], 67). If this last motif is in view, then catching people is the opposite of catching fish: The fish would be caught, killed, cooked, and eaten; people would be caught so as to remove them from eternal destruction and to give them new life.</p>
<a name="136"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=36><b>sn</b> The expression <i>followed him</i> pictures discipleship, which means that to learn from Jesus is to follow him as the guiding priority of one&#8217;s life.</p>

Mark assumes a certain preunderstanding on the part of his readers about the first four disciples and hence the translation &#8220;their boat&#8221; is justified (cf. also v. 20 in which the &#8220;hired men&#8221; indicates that Zebedee&#8217;s family owned the boats). </p>

Though its origin is not entirely clear, it seems to have arisen in the postexilic community during the intertestamental period. A town could establish a synagogue if there were at least ten men. In normative Judaism of the NT period, the OT scripture was read and discussed in the synagogue by the men who were present. (See the Mishnah, <i>m. Megillah</i> 3-4; <i>m. Berakhot</i> 2.) First came the law, then the prophets, then someone was asked to speak on the texts. Jesus undoubtedly took the opportunity on this occasion to speak about his person and mission, and its relationship to Old Testament fulfillment. </p>

The people referred to here were recognized experts in the law of Moses and in traditional laws and regulations. Thus &#8220;expert in the law&#8221; comes closer to the meaning for the modern reader.</p>

The equivalent Hebrew expression in the OT had two basic meanings: (1) When one person was unjustly bothering another, the injured party could say &#8220;What to me and to you?&#8221; meaning, &#8220;What have I done to you that you should do this to me?&#8221; (Judg 11:12, 2 Chr 35:21, 1 Kgs 17:18). (2) When someone was asked to get involved in a matter he felt was no business of his own, he could say to the one asking him, &#8220;What to me and to you?&#8221; meaning, &#8220;That is your business, how am I involved?&#8221; (2 Kgs 3:13, Hos 14:8). Option (1) implies hostility, while option (2) merely implies disengagement. BDAG suggests the following as glosses for this expression: <i>What have I to do with you? What have we in common? Leave me alone! Never mind! </i>Hostility between Jesus and the demons is certainly to be understood in this context, hence the translation: &#8220;Leave me alone&#8230;.&#8221; For a very similar expression see Lk 8:28 and (in a different context) John 2:4.</p>

It is more difficult to account for a change from &#8220;moved with compassion&#8221; to &#8220;moved with anger&#8221; than it is for a copyist to soften &#8220;moved with anger&#8221; to &#8220;moved with compassion,&#8221; making the decision quite difficult. B. M. Metzger (<i>TCGNT</i> 65) suggests that &#8220;moved with anger&#8221; could have been prompted by 1:43, &#8220;Jesus sent the man away with a very strong warning.&#8221; It also could have been prompted by the man&#8217;s seeming doubt about Jesus&#8217; desire to heal him (v. 40). As well, it is difficult to explain why scribes would be prone to soften the text here but not in Mark 3:5 or 10:14 (where Jesus is also said to be angry or indignant). Thus, in light of diverse <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> supporting &#8220;moved with compassion,&#8221; and at least a plausible explanation for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8000;&#961;&#947;&#953;&#963;&#952;&#949;&#943;&#962;</font> as arising from the other reading, it is perhaps best to adopt <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#960;&#955;&#945;&#947;&#967;&#957;&#953;&#963;&#952;&#949;&#943;&#962;</font> as the original reading.
