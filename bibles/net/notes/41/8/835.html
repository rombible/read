<A NAME="835"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=462><b>tc</b> Codex Bezae (D) replaces &#8220;Do not even go into the village&#8221; with &#8220;Go to your house, and do not tell anyone, not even in the village.&#8221; Other <sc>mss with some minor variations (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13 </sup>28 565 2542 <i>pc</i>) expand on this prohibition to read &#8220;Go to your house, and if you go into the village, do not tell anyone.&#8221; There are several other variants here as well. While these expansions are not part of Mark&#8217;s original text, they do accurately reflect the sense of Jesus&#8217; prohibition.</p>
