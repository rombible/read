The author of Mark shortened this long phrase to just one word in Greek when repeated here, and the phrase &#8220;expensive ointment&#8221; used in the translation is intended as an abbreviated paraphrase.</p>

<A NAME="1425"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=834><b>sn</b> Generally <i>the feast of Unleavened Bread</i> would refer to Nisan 15 (Friday), but the following reference to the sacrifice of the <i>Passover</i> lamb indicates that Nisan 14 (Thursday) was what Mark had in mind (Nisan = March 27 to April 25). The celebration of the Feast of Unleavened Bread lasted eight days, beginning with the Passover meal. The celebrations were so close together that at times the names of both were used interchangeably.</p>

<A NAME="1427"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=836><b>sn</b> This required getting a suitable lamb and finding lodging in Jerusalem where the meal could be eaten. The population of the city swelled during the feast, so lodging could be difficult to find. The <i>Passover</i> was celebrated each year in commemoration of the Israelites&#8217; deliverance from Egypt; thus it was a feast celebrating redemption (see Exod 12). The Passover lamb was roasted and eaten after sunset in a family group of at least ten people (<i>m. Pesahim </i>7.13). People ate the meal while reclining (see the note on <i>table</i> in 14:18). It included, besides the lamb, unleavened bread and bitter herbs as a reminder of Israel&#8217;s bitter affliction at the hands of the Egyptians. Four cups of wine mixed with water were also used for the meal. For a further description of the meal and the significance of the wine cups, see E. Ferguson, <i>Backgrounds of Early Christianity, </i>523-24.</p>
<A NAME="1428"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=837><b>sn</b> Since women usually carried these jars, it would have been no problem for the two disciples (Luke 22:8 states that they were Peter and John) to recognize the <i>man</i> Jesus was referring to.</p>

<A NAME="1438"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=847><b>sn</b> <i>One who dips with me in the bowl. </i>The point of Jesus&#8217; comment here is not to identify the specific individual per se, but to indicate that it is one who was close to him &#8211; somebody whom no one would suspect. His comment serves to heighten the treachery of Judas&#8217; betrayal.</p>

<A NAME="1495"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">95</span><note=904><b>tc</b> Several important witnesses (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B L W <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font>* 579 892 2427 <i>pc</i>) lack the words &#8220;and a rooster crowed.&#8221; The fact that such good and early Alexandrian witnesses lack these words makes this textual problem difficult to decide, especially because the words receive support from other witnesses, some of which are fairly decent (A C D <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font><sup>c</sup> 067 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13</sup> 33 [1424] <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font><i> </i>lat). The omission could have been intentional on the part of some Alexandrian scribes who wished to bring this text in line with the other Gospel accounts that only mention a rooster crowing once (Matt 26:74; Luke 22:60; John 18:27). The insertion could be an attempt to make the fulfillment of Jesus&#8217; prophecy in 14:30 more explicit. Internally, the words &#8220;and a rooster crowed&#8221; fit Mark&#8217;s Gospel here, not only in view of 14:30, &#8220;before a rooster crows twice,&#8221; but also in view of the mention of &#8220;a second time&#8221; in 14:71 (a reading which is much more textually secure). Nevertheless, a decision is difficult.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> A real rooster crowing is probably in view here (rather than the Roman trumpet call known as <i>gallicinium</i>), in part due to the fact that Mark mentions the rooster crowing twice. See the discussion at Matt 26:74.</p>

The reason for the anarthrous construction is most likely to indicate generically that <i>some</i> rooster crowed. Further, the translation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#955;&#941;&#954;&#964;&#969;&#961;</font> as an indefinite noun retains the subtlety of the Greek in only hinting at the Lord&#8217;s prediction v. 30.
