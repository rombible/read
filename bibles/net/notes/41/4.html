<A NAME="41"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=209><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;and all the crowd.&#8221; The clause in this phrase, although coordinate in terms of grammar, is logically subordinate to the previous clause.</p>
<A NAME="42"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=210><b>sn</b> Though parables can contain a variety of figures of speech (cf. 2:19-22; 3:23-25; 4:3-9, 26-32; 7:15-17; 13:28), many times they are simply stories that attempt to teach spiritual truth (which is unknown to the hearers) by using a comparison with something known to the hearers. In general, parables usually advance a single idea, though there may be many parts and characters in a single parable and subordinate ideas may expand the main idea further. The beauty of using the parable as a teaching device is that it draws the listener into the story, elicits an evaluation, and demands a response.</p>
<A NAME="43"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=211><b>sn</b> <i>A sower went out to sow. </i>The background for this well-known parable, drawn from a typical scene in the Palestinian countryside, is a field through which a well worn path runs. Sowing would occur in late fall or early winter (October to December) in the rainy season, looking for sprouting in April or May and a June harvest. The use of seed as a figure for God&#8217;s giving life has OT roots (Isa 55:10-11). The point of the parable of the sower is to illustrate the various responses to the message of the kingdom of God (cf. 4:11).</p>
<A NAME="44"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=212><b>tn</b> Mark&#8217;s version of the parable, like Luke&#8217;s (cf. Luke 8:4-8), uses the collective singular to refer to the seed throughout, so singular pronouns have been used consistently throughout this parable in the English translation. However, the parallel account in Matt 13:1-9 begins with plural pronouns in v. 4 but then switches to the collective singular in v. 5 ff.</p>
<A NAME="45"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=213><b>sn</b> The <i>rocky ground</i> in Palestine would be a limestone base lying right under the soil.</p>
<A NAME="46"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=214><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;it did not have enough depth of earth.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="47"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=215><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;it did not have root.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="48"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=216><b>sn</b> Palestinian weeds like these <i>thorns </i>could grow up to six feet in height and have a major root system.</p>
<A NAME="49"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=217><b>sn</b> That is, crowded out the good plants.</p>
<A NAME="410"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=218><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;but&#8221; to indicate the contrast present in the final stage of the parable.</p>
<A NAME="411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=219><b>tn</b> The translation &#8220;had better listen!&#8221; captures the force of the third person imperative more effectively than the traditional &#8220;let him hear,&#8221; which sounds more like a permissive than an imperative to the modern English reader. This was Jesus&#8217; common expression to listen and heed carefully (cf. Matt 11:15; 13:9, 43; Mark 4:23; Luke 8:8, 14:35).</p>
<A NAME="412"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=220><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the mystery.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The key term <i>secret</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#965;&#963;&#964;&#8053;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">musthrion</font>) can mean either (1) a new revelation or (2) a revealing interpretation of existing revelation as in Dan 2:17-23, 27-30. Jesus seems to be explaining how current events develop old promises, since the NT consistently links the events of Jesus&#8217; ministry and message with old promises (Rom 1:1-4; Heb 1:1-2). The traditional translation of this word, &#8220;mystery,&#8221; is misleading to the modern English reader because it suggests a secret which people have tried to uncover but which they have failed to understand (L&amp;N 28.77).</p>
<A NAME="413"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=221><b>tn</b> This is an example of a &#8220;divine passive,&#8221; with God understood to be the source of the revelation (see <i>ExSyn</i> 437-38).</p>
<A NAME="414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=222><b>sn</b> A quotation from Isa 6:9-10. Thus parables both conceal or reveal depending on whether one is open to hearing what they teach.</p>
<A NAME="415"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=223><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And.&#8221; Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;then&#8221; to indicate the implied sequence of events within the narrative.</p>
<A NAME="416"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=224><b>sn</b> Interestingly, the synoptic parallels each use a different word for Satan here: Matt 13:19 has &#8220;the evil one,&#8221; while Luke 8:12 has &#8220;the devil.&#8221; This illustrates the fluidity of the gospel tradition in often using synonyms at the same point of the parallel tradition.</p>
<A NAME="417"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=225><b>sn</b> The <i>word</i> of Jesus has the potential to save if it germinates in a person&#8217;s heart, something the devil is very much against.</p>
<A NAME="418"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=226><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And.&#8221; Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;but&#8221; to indicate the contrast present in this context.</p>
<A NAME="419"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=227><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;are temporary.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="420"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=228><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;and.&#8221; Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;but&#8221; to indicate the contrast present in this context.</p>
<A NAME="421"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=229><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the deceitfulness of riches.&#8221; Cf. BDAG 99 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#940;&#964;&#951;</font> 1, &#8220;the seduction which comes from wealth.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="422"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=230><b>sn</b> That is, their concern for spiritual things is crowded out by material things.</p>
<A NAME="423"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=231><b>tn</b> Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;but&#8221; to indicate the contrast present in this context.</p>
<A NAME="424"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=232><b>sn</b> The <i>lamp</i> is probably an ancient oil burning lamp or perhaps a candlestick. Jesus is comparing revelation to light, particularly the revelation of his ministry.</p>
<A NAME="425"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=233><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;a bowl&#8221;; this refers to any container for dry material of about eight liters (two gallons) capacity. It could be translated &#8220;basket, box, bowl&#8221; (L&amp;N 6.151).</p>
<A NAME="426"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=234><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;disclosed.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="427"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=235><b>tn</b> The translation &#8220;had better listen!&#8221; captures the force of the third person imperative more effectively than the traditional &#8220;let him hear,&#8221; which sounds more like a permissive than an imperative to the modern English reader. This was Jesus&#8217; common expression to listen and heed carefully (cf. Matt 11:15; 13:9, 43; Mark 4:9; Luke 8:8, 14:35).</p>
<A NAME="428"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=236><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;by [the measure] with which you measure it will be measured to you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="429"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=237><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;and.&#8221; Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;but&#8221; to indicate the contrast present in this context.</p>
<A NAME="430"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=238><b>sn</b> <i>What he has will be taken from him. </i>The meaning is that the one who accepts Jesus&#8217; teaching concerning his person and the kingdom will receive a share in the kingdom now and even more in the future, but for the one who rejects Jesus&#8217; words, the opportunity that that person presently possesses with respect to the kingdom will someday be taken away forever. </p>
<A NAME="431"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=239><b>tn</b> The Greek word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#8016;&#952;&#973;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">euqus</font>, often translated &#8220;immediately&#8221; or &#8220;right away&#8221;) has not been translated here. It sometimes occurs with a weakened, inferential use (BDAG 406 s.v. 2), not contributing significantly to the flow of the narrative. For further discussion, see R. J. Decker, <i>Temporal Deixis of the Greek Verb in the Gospel of Mark with Reference to Verbal Aspect</i> (SBG 10), 73-77.</p>
<A NAME="432"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=240><b>sn</b> <i>Because the harvest has come. </i>This parable is found only in Mark (cf. Matt 13:24-30) and presents a complete picture of the coming of God&#8217;s kingdom: (1) sowing; (2) growth; (3) harvest. Some understand the parable as a reference to evangelism. While this is certainly involved, it does not seem to be the central idea. In contrast to the parable of the sower which emphasizes the quality of the different soils, this parable emphasizes the power of the seed to cause growth (with the clear implication that the mysterious growth of the kingdom is accomplished by God), apart from human understanding and observation.</p>
<A NAME="433"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=241><b>sn</b> Mustard seeds are known for their tiny size.</p>
<A NAME="434"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=242><b>tn</b> Mark 4:31-32 is fairly awkward in Greek. Literally the sentence reads as follows: &#8220;As a mustard seed, which when sown in the earth, being the smallest of all the seeds in the earth, and when it is sown, it grows up&#8230;&#8221; The structure has been rendered in more idiomatic English, although some of the awkward structure has been retained for rhetorical effect.</p>
<A NAME="435"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=243><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the birds of the sky&#8221; or &#8220;the birds of the heaven&#8221;; the Greek word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8016;&#961;&#945;&#957;&#972;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ouranos</font>) may be translated either &#8220;sky&#8221; or &#8220;heaven,&#8221; depending on the context. The idiomatic expression &#8220;birds of the sky&#8221; refers to wild birds as opposed to domesticated fowl (cf. BDAG 809 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#949;&#964;&#949;&#953;&#957;&#972;&#957;</font>).</p>
<A NAME="436"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=244><b>sn</b> The point of the parable seems to be that while the kingdom of God may appear to have insignificant and unnoticeable beginnings (i.e., in the ministry of Jesus), it will someday (i.e., at the second advent) be great and quite expansive. The kingdom, however, is not to be equated with the church, but rather the church is an expression of the kingdom. Also, there is important OT background in the image of the mustard seed that grew and became a tree: Ezek 17:22-24 pictures the reemergence of the Davidic house where people can find calm and shelter. Like the mustard seed, it would start out small but grow to significant size.</p>
<A NAME="437"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=245><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And.&#8221; Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;so&#8221; to indicate the implied result of previous action(s) in the narrative.</p>
<A NAME="438"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=246><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Jesus) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="439"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=247><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;of the lake&#8221; is not in the Greek text but is clearly implied; it has been supplied here for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="440"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=248><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And.&#8221; Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;so&#8221; to indicate the response to Jesus&#8217; request.</p>
<A NAME="441"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=249><b>tn</b> It is possible that this prepositional phrase modifies &#8220;as he was,&#8221; not &#8220;they took him along.&#8221; The meaning would then be &#8220;they took him along in the boat in which he was already sitting&#8221; (see 4:1).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> A <i>boat</i> that held all the disciples would be of significant size.</p>
<A NAME="442"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=250><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And.&#8221; Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;now&#8221; to indicate the transition to a new topic.</p>
<A NAME="443"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=251><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;a squall.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The Sea of Galilee is located in a depression some 700 ft (200 m) below sea level and is surrounded by hills. Frequently a rush of wind and the right mix of temperatures can cause a storm to come suddenly on the lake. Storms on the Sea of Galilee were known for their suddenness and violence.</p>
<A NAME="444"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=252><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And.&#8221; Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;but&#8221; to indicate the contrast present in this context.</p>
<A NAME="445"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=253><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And.&#8221; Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;so&#8221; to indicate the implied result of previous action(s) in the narrative.</p>
<A NAME="446"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=254><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;commanded&#8221; (often with the implication of a threat, L&amp;N 33.331).</p>
<A NAME="447"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=255><b>sn</b> Who has authority over the seas and winds is discussed in the OT: Ps 104:3; 135:7; 107:23-30. When Jesus <i>rebuked the wind </i>and <i>the sea </i>he was making a statement about who he was.</p>
<A NAME="448"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=256><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And.&#8221; Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated as &#8220;then&#8221; to indicate the implied sequence of events within the narrative.</p>
<A NAME="449"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=257><b>sn</b> Jesus&#8217; authority over creation raised a question for the disciples about who he was exactly (<i>Who then is this?</i>). This verse shows that the disciples followed Jesus even though they did not know all about him yet.</p>
<A NAME="450"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=258><b>sn</b> This section in Mark (4:35-5:43) contains four miracles: (1) the calming of the storm; (2) the exorcism of the demon-possessed man; (3) the giving of life to Jairus&#8217; daughter; (4) the healing of the woman hemorrhaging for twelve years. All these miracles demonstrate Jesus&#8217; right to proclaim the kingdom message and his sovereign authority over forces, directly or indirectly, hostile to the kingdom. The last three may have been brought together to show that Jesus had power over all defilement, since contact with graves, blood, or a corpse was regarded under Jewish law as causing a state of ritual uncleanness. </p>
