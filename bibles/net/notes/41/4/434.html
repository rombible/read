<A NAME="434"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=242><b>tn</b> Mark 4:31-32 is fairly awkward in Greek. Literally the sentence reads as follows: &#8220;As a mustard seed, which when sown in the earth, being the smallest of all the seeds in the earth, and when it is sown, it grows up&#8230;&#8221; The structure has been rendered in more idiomatic English, although some of the awkward structure has been retained for rhetorical effect.</p>
