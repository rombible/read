<A NAME="432"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=240><b>sn</b> <i>Because the harvest has come. </i>This parable is found only in Mark (cf. Matt 13:24-30) and presents a complete picture of the coming of God&#8217;s kingdom: (1) sowing; (2) growth; (3) harvest. Some understand the parable as a reference to evangelism. While this is certainly involved, it does not seem to be the central idea. In contrast to the parable of the sower which emphasizes the quality of the different soils, this parable emphasizes the power of the seed to cause growth (with the clear implication that the mysterious growth of the kingdom is accomplished by God), apart from human understanding and observation.</p>
