<A NAME="412"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=220><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the mystery.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The key term <i>secret</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#965;&#963;&#964;&#8053;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">musthrion</font>) can mean either (1) a new revelation or (2) a revealing interpretation of existing revelation as in Dan 2:17-23, 27-30. Jesus seems to be explaining how current events develop old promises, since the NT consistently links the events of Jesus&#8217; ministry and message with old promises (Rom 1:1-4; Heb 1:1-2). The traditional translation of this word, &#8220;mystery,&#8221; is misleading to the modern English reader because it suggests a secret which people have tried to uncover but which they have failed to understand (L&amp;N 28.77).</p>
