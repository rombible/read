<A NAME="44"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=212><b>tn</b> Mark&#8217;s version of the parable, like Luke&#8217;s (cf. Luke 8:4-8), uses the collective singular to refer to the seed throughout, so singular pronouns have been used consistently throughout this parable in the English translation. However, the parallel account in Matt 13:1-9 begins with plural pronouns in v. 4 but then switches to the collective singular in v. 5 ff.</p>
