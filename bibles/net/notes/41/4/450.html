<A NAME="450"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=258><b>sn</b> This section in Mark (4:35-5:43) contains four miracles: (1) the calming of the storm; (2) the exorcism of the demon-possessed man; (3) the giving of life to Jairus&#8217; daughter; (4) the healing of the woman hemorrhaging for twelve years. All these miracles demonstrate Jesus&#8217; right to proclaim the kingdom message and his sovereign authority over forces, directly or indirectly, hostile to the kingdom. The last three may have been brought together to show that Jesus had power over all defilement, since contact with graves, blood, or a corpse was regarded under Jewish law as causing a state of ritual uncleanness. </p>
