It is generally assumed that as a group the Herodians were Jewish supporters of the Herodian dynasty (or of Herod Antipas in particular). In every instance they are linked with the Pharisees. This probably reflects agreement regarding political objectives (nationalism as opposed to submission to the yoke of Roman oppression) rather than philosophy or religious beliefs.</p>

<A NAME="326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=170><b>sn</b> Jesus did not permit the demons <i>to make him known </i>because the time for such disclosure was not yet at hand, and such a revelation would have certainly been misunderstood by the people. In all likelihood, if the people had understood him early on to be the Son of God, or Messiah, they would have reduced his mission to one of political deliverance from Roman oppression (cf. John 6:15). Jesus wanted to avoid, as much as possible, any premature misunderstanding about who he was and what he was doing. However, at the end of his ministry, he did not deny such a title when the high priest asked him (14:61-62).</p>

<A NAME="329"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=173><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And he.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="330"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=174><b>sn</b> The term <i>apostles</i> is rare in the gospels, found only here and Mark 6:30, Matt 10:2, and six more times in Luke (6:13; 9:10; 11:49; 17:5; 22:14; 24:10).</p>
<A NAME="331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=175><b>tc</b> The phrase &#8220;whom he named apostles&#8221; is lacking in the majority of <sc>mss (A C<sup>2</sup> [D] L <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1 </sup>33 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font><i> </i>latt sy). Several primary Alexandrian and Caesarean witnesses (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B [C* W] <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13</sup> 28 <i>pc</i> co) include the phrase, so the external evidence is strongly in favor of this reading, especially since Alexandrian witnesses tend to witness to the <i>shorter</i> reading. It is possible that the Alexandrian witnesses have inserted these words to bring the text in line with Luke 6:13 (<i>TCGNT</i> 69), but against this is the internal evidence of Mark&#8217;s style: Mark tends toward gratuitous redundancy. Thus the inclusion of this phrase is supported by both internal and external evidence and should be regarded as more likely original than the omission.</p>
<A NAME="332"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=176><b>tc</b> The phrase &#8220;he appointed twelve&#8221; is lacking in the majority of manuscripts (A C<sup>2</sup> D L <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1</sup> 33 2427 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat sy bo). Some important witnesses include the phrase (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B C* <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#916;</font> 565 579 <i>pc</i>), but perhaps the best explanation for the omission of the clause in the majority of witnesses is haplography in combination with homoioarcton: The first word of the clause in question is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>), and the first word after the clause in question is also <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font>. And the first two letters of the second word, in each instance, are <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#960;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ep</font>). Early scribes most likely jumped accidentally from the first <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> to the second, omitting the intervening material. Thus the clause was most likely in the original text. (See 3:14 above for a related textual problem.)</p>

He may not have been technically a member of the particular Jewish nationalistic party known as &#8220;Zealots&#8221; (since according to some scholars this party had not been organized at that time), but simply someone who was zealous for Jewish independence from Rome, in which case the term would refer to his temperament.</p>
<A NAME="339"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=183><b>sn</b> There is some debate about what the name <i>Iscariot</i> means. It probably alludes to a region in Judea and thus might make Judas the only non-Galilean in the group. Several explanations for the name <i>Iscariot</i> have been proposed, but it is probably transliterated Hebrew with the meaning &#8220;man of Kerioth&#8221; (there are at least two villages that had that name). For further discussion see D. L. Bock, <i>Luke</i> (BECNT), 1:546; also D. A. Carson, <i>John</i>, 304.</p>

But this reading is obviously motivated, for it removes the embarrassing statement about Jesus&#8217; family&#8217;s opinion of him as &#8220;out of his mind&#8221; and transfers this view to the Lord&#8217;s opponents. The fact that virtually all other witnesses have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#7985; &#960;&#945;&#961;&#8127; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</font> here, coupled with the strong internal evidence for the shorter reading, shows this Western reading to be secondary.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> On the meaning &#8220;family&#8221; for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#7985; &#960;&#945;&#961;&#8127; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joi par</font>&#8217;<font face="Greektl"> autou</font>), see BDAG 756-57 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#940;</font> A.3.b.<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#946;</font>.<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;</font>.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The incident involving the religious leaders accusing Jesus of being in league with the devil (3:22-30) is sandwiched between Mark&#8217;s mention of Jesus&#8217; <i>family</i> coming <i>to restrain him </i>(the Greek word for <i>restrain </i>here is also used to mean <i>arrest</i>; see Mark 6:17; 12:12; 14:1, 44, 46, 49, 51) because they thought he was <i>out of his mind</i> (3:21). It is probably Mark&#8217;s intention in this structure to show that Jesus&#8217; family is to be regarded as not altogether unlike the experts in the law [scribes] in their perception of the true identity of Jesus; they are incorrect in their understanding of him as well. The tone is obviously one of sadness and the emphasis on Jesus&#8217; true family in vv. 31-35 serves to underscore the comparison between his relatives and the scribes on the one hand, and those who truly obey God on the other. </p>

<A NAME="349"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=193><b>sn</b> Jesus spoke two <i>parables</i> to demonstrate the absurdity of the thinking of the religious leaders who maintained that he was in league with Satan and that he actually derived his power from the devil. The first parable (vv. 23-26) teaches that if Jesus cast out demons by the ruler of the demons, then in reality Satan is fighting against himself, with the result that his kingdom has come to an end. The second parable (v. 28) about tying up a strong man proves that Jesus does not need to align himself with the devil because Jesus is more powerful. Jesus defeated Satan at his temptation (1:12-13) and by his exorcisms he clearly demonstrated himself to be stronger than the devil. The passage reveals the desperate condition of the religious leaders, who in their hatred for Jesus end up attributing the work of the Holy Spirit to Satan (a position for which they will be held accountable, 3:29-30). For an explanation of what a parable is, see the note on <i>parables</i> in 4:2.</p>
<A NAME="350"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=194><b>sn</b> The three conditional statements in vv. 24-26 express the logical result of the assumption that Jesus heals by Satan&#8217;s power, expressed by the religious leaders. The point is clear: If the leaders are correct, then Satan&#8217;s kingdom will not stand, so the suggestion makes no sense. Satan would not seek to heal.</p>
<A NAME="351"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=195><b>sn</b> The <i>strong man </i>here pictures Satan. </p>
<A NAME="352"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=196><b>sn</b> Some see the imagery here as similar to Eph 4:7-10, although no opponents are explicitly named in that passage.

<A NAME="355"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=199><b>sn</b> <i>Is guilty of an eternal sin.</i> This passage has troubled many people, who have wondered whether or not they have committed this <i>eternal</i> <i>sin</i>. Three things must be kept in mind: (1) the nature of the sin is to ascribe what is the obvious work of the Holy Spirit (e.g., releasing people from Satan&#8217;s power) to Satan himself; (2) it is not simply a momentary doubt or sinful attitude, but is indeed a settled condition which opposes the Spirit&#8217;s work, as typified by the religious leaders who opposed Jesus; and (3) a person who is concerned about it has probably never committed this sin, for those who commit it here (i.e., the religious leaders) are not in the least concerned about Jesus&#8217; warning. On this last point see W. W. Wessel, &#8220;Mark,&#8221; <i>EBC </i>8:645-46.</p>

However, the pedigree of several of the <sc>mss which lack this phrase is considerable (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B C K L W <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#916;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13</sup> 28 33 565 892 1241 1424 2542 <i>pm</i> lat sy). It seems likely that this phrase was added by an early Western scribe to harmonize this statement with Jesus&#8217; response in v. 35. NA<sup>27</sup> has the words in brackets, indicating some doubt as to their authenticity.</p>
<A NAME="362"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=206><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Who is my mother and my brothers?&#8221; The use of the singular verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">estin</font>) here singles out Mary above Jesus&#8217; brothers, giving her special prominence (see <i>ExSyn</i> 401-2). This is slightly unnatural in English since the predicate nominative is plural, though, so a plural verb was used in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="363"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=207><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;Behold my mother and my brothers.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="364"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=208><b>tn</b> The pleonastic pronoun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8023;&#964;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jouto&quot;</font>, &#8220;this one&#8221;) which precedes this verb has not been translated.</p>
