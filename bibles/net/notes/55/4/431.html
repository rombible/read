<A NAME="431"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=137><b>tc</b> Most witnesses (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>2</sup> D <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat sy) conclude this letter with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">amhn</font>, &#8220;amen&#8221;). Such a conclusion is routinely added by scribes to NT books because a few of these books originally had such an ending (cf. Rom 16:27; Gal 6:18; Jude 25). A majority of Greek witnesses have the concluding <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957; </font>in every NT book except Acts, James, and 3 John (and even in these books, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font> is found in some witnesses). It is thus a predictable variant. Further, there are several excellent witnesses of the Alexandrian and Western texts (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* A C F G 6 33 81 1739* 1881 sa) that lack the particle, rendering the omission the preferred reading. </p>
