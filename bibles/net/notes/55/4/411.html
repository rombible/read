<A NAME="411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=117><b>sn</b> The expression <i>I have competed well</i> (<i>Grk </i>&#8220;I have competed the good competition&#8221;) uses words that may refer to a race or to a boxing or wrestling match: &#8220;run the good race&#8221; or &#8220;fight the good fight.&#8221; The similar phrase in 1 Tim 1:18 uses a military picture and is more literally &#8220;war the good warfare.&#8221;</p>
