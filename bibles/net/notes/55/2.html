<A NAME="217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=48><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;with eternal glory.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=49><b>sn</b> <i>This saying </i>(<i>Grk</i> &#8220;the saying&#8221;) refers to the following citation. See 1 Tim 1:15; 3:1; 4:9; Titus 3:8 for other occurrences of this phrase.</p>
<A NAME="219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=50><b>sn</b> The following passage has been typeset as poetry because many scholars regard this passage as poetic or hymnic. These terms are used broadly to refer to the genre of writing, not to the content. There are two broad criteria for determining if a passage is poetic or hymnic: &#8220;(a) <i>stylistic:</i> a certain rhythmical lilt when the passages are read aloud, the presence of <i>parallelismus membrorum</i> (i.e., an arrangement into couplets), the semblance of some metre, and the presence of rhetorical devices such as alliteration, <i>chiasmus</i>, and antithesis; and (b) <i>linguistic: </i>an unusual vocabulary, particularly the presence of theological terms, which is different from the surrounding context&#8221; (P. T. O&#8217;Brien, <i>Philippians </i>[NIGTC], 188-89). Classifying a passage as hymnic or poetic is important because understanding this genre can provide keys to interpretation. However, not all scholars agree that the above criteria are present in this passage, so the decision to typeset it as poetry should be viewed as a tentative decision about its genre.</p>
<A NAME="220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=51><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;died together&#8230;will live together&#8230;will reign together,&#8221; without &#8220;him&#8221; stated explicitly. But &#8220;him&#8221; is implied by the parallel ideas in Rom 6:8; 8:17 and by the reference to Christ in vv. 12b-13.</p>
<A NAME="221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=52><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;renounce,&#8221; &#8220;disown,&#8221; &#8220;repudiate.&#8221; It is important to note that the object of Christ&#8217;s denial is &#8220;us.&#8221; The text does not contain an implied object complement (&#8220;he will deny us [x]&#8221;), which would mean that Christ was withholding something from us (for example, &#8220;The owner denied his pets water&#8221;), since the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#961;&#957;&#941;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">arneomai</font>) is not one of the category of verbs that normally occurs in these constructions (see <i>ExSyn</i> 182-89). </p>
<A NAME="222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=53><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;if we renounce,&#8221; but the &#8220;him&#8221; is implied by the parallel clauses.</p>
<A NAME="223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=54><b>sn</b> <i>If we are unfaithful&#8230;he cannot deny himself. </i>This could be (1) a word of warning (The Lord will exact punishment; he cannot deny his holiness) or (2) a word of hope (Because of who he is, he remains faithful to us despite our lapses). The latter is more likely, since Paul consistently cites God&#8217;s faithfulness as a reassurance, not as a warning (cf. especially Rom 3:3; also 1 Cor 1:9; 10:13; 2 Cor 1:18; 1 Thess 5:24; 2 Thess 3:3).</p>
<A NAME="224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=55><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;remind of these things,&#8221; implying &#8220;them&#8221; or &#8220;people&#8221; as the object.</p>
<A NAME="225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=56><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;solemnly charging.&#8221; The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#945;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#965;&#961;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">diamarturomeno&quot;</font>) has been translated as a finite verb due to requirements of contemporary English style.</p>
<A NAME="226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=57><b>tc</b> &#8225; Most witnesses (A D <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 048 1739 1881 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> sy) have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#965;&#961;&#943;&#959;&#965;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kuriou</font>, &#8220;Lord&#8221;) instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">qeou</font>, &#8220;God&#8221;) here, while a few have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Cristou</font>, &#8220;Christ&#8221;; 206 {429 1758}). <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font>, however, is well supported by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> C F G I 614 629 630 1175 <i>al</i>. Internally, the Pastorals never elsewhere use the expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957;&#8061;&#960;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#954;&#965;&#961;&#943;&#959;&#965;</font> (<font face="Greektl">enwpion kuriou</font>, &#8220;before the Lord&#8221;), but consistently use <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957;&#8061;&#960;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font> (&#8220;before God&#8221;; cf. 1 Tim 2:3; 5:4, 21; 6:13; 2 Tim 4:1). But this fact could be argued both ways: The author&#8217;s style may be in view, or scribes may have adjusted the wording to conform it to the Pastorals&#8217; universal expression. Further, only twice in the NT (Jas 4:10 [<i>v.l. </i><font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font>]; Rev 11:4 [<i>v.l.</i> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font>]) is the expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957;&#8061;&#960;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#954;&#965;&#961;&#943;&#959;&#965;</font> found. That such an expression is not found in the <i>corpus Paulinum</i> seems to be sufficient impetus for scribes to change the wording here. Thus, although the external evidence is somewhat on the side of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font>, the internal evidence is on the side of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#965;&#961;&#943;&#959;&#965;</font>. A decision is difficult, but <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#965;&#961;&#943;&#959;&#965;</font> is the preferred reading.</p>
<A NAME="227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=58><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;[it is] beneficial for nothing, for the ruin of those who listen.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=59><b>sn</b> <i>Accurately</i> is a figure of speech that literally means something like &#8220;cutting a straight road.&#8221; In regard to the message of truth, it means &#8220;correctly handling&#8221; or &#8220;imparting it without deviation.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=60><b>sn</b> <i>Profane chatter</i> was apparently a characteristic of the false teachers in Ephesus (cf. 1 Tim 1:3-4; 4:7; 6:20).</p>
<A NAME="230"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=61><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;they [who engage in it] will progress even more in ungodliness.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=63><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;of whom are Hymenaeus and Philetus.&#8221; Because of the length and complexity of the Greek sentence, this last clause has been made a new sentence in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=64><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;have deviated concerning the truth.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=66><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;names the name of the Lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="236"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=67><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;a great house.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="237"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=68><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;for dishonor,&#8221; probably referring to vessels used for refuse or excrement.</p>
<A NAME="238"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=69><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;from these,&#8221; alluding to the errors and deeds of the false teachers described in vv. 14-19.</p>
<A NAME="239"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=70><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;and peace, with those.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="240"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=71><b>sn</b> <i>In company with others who call on the Lord from a pure heart</i> alludes to the value of the community of believers for the development of Christian virtues.</p>

<A NAME="242"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=73><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;fights,&#8221; although this could suggest weapons and blows, whereas in the present context this is not the primary focus. Although &#8220;quarrel&#8221; is frequently used here (NAB, NIV, NRSV) it may be understood to refer to a relatively minor disagreement.</p>
<A NAME="243"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=74><b>tn</b> Traditionally, &#8220;servant&#8221; or &#8220;bondservant.&#8221; Though <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#959;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">doulos</font>) is normally translated &#8220;servant,&#8221; the word does not bear the connotation of a free individual serving another. BDAG notes that &#8220;&#8216;servant&#8217; for &#8216;slave&#8217; is largely confined to Biblical transl. and early American times&#8230;in normal usage at the present time the two words are carefully distinguished&#8221; (BDAG 260 s.v.). The most accurate translation is &#8220;bondservant&#8221; (sometimes found in the ASV for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#959;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font>), in that it often indicates one who sells himself into slavery to another. But as this is archaic, few today understand its force.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Undoubtedly the background for the concept of being the Lord&#8217;s slave or servant is to be found in the Old Testament scriptures. For a Jew this concept did not connote drudgery, but honor and privilege. It was used of national Israel at times (Isa 43:10), but was especially associated with famous OT personalities, including such great men as Moses (Josh 14:7), David (Ps 89:3; cf. 2 Sam 7:5, 8) and Elijah (2 Kgs 10:10); all these men were &#8220;servants (or slaves) of the Lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="244"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=75><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;must not fight&#8221; or &#8220;must not quarrel.&#8221; The Greek verb is related to the noun translated &#8220;infighting&#8221; in v. 23.</p>
<A NAME="245"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=76><b>sn</b> <i>Correcting</i> is the word for &#8220;child-training&#8221; or &#8220;discipline.&#8221; It is often positive (training, educating) but here denotes the negative side (correcting, disciplining).</p>
<A NAME="246"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=77><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;repentance unto knowledge of the truth.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="247"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=78><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;having been captured by him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="248"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=79><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;for that one&#8217;s will,&#8221; referring to the devil, but with a different pronoun than in the previous phrase &#8220;by him.&#8221; Some have construed &#8220;for his will&#8221; with the earlier verb and referred the pronoun to God: &#8220;come to their senses and escape the devil&#8217;s trap (though they have been captured by him) in order to do His will.&#8221; In Classical Greek the shift in pronouns would suggest this, but in Koine Greek this change is not significant. The more natural sense is a reference to the devil&#8217;s will.</p>
