<A NAME="223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=54><b>sn</b> <i>If we are unfaithful&#8230;he cannot deny himself. </i>This could be (1) a word of warning (The Lord will exact punishment; he cannot deny his holiness) or (2) a word of hope (Because of who he is, he remains faithful to us despite our lapses). The latter is more likely, since Paul consistently cites God&#8217;s faithfulness as a reassurance, not as a warning (cf. especially Rom 3:3; also 1 Cor 1:9; 10:13; 2 Cor 1:18; 1 Thess 5:24; 2 Thess 3:3).</p>
