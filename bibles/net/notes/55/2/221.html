<A NAME="221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=52><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;renounce,&#8221; &#8220;disown,&#8221; &#8220;repudiate.&#8221; It is important to note that the object of Christ&#8217;s denial is &#8220;us.&#8221; The text does not contain an implied object complement (&#8220;he will deny us [x]&#8221;), which would mean that Christ was withholding something from us (for example, &#8220;The owner denied his pets water&#8221;), since the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#961;&#957;&#941;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">arneomai</font>) is not one of the category of verbs that normally occurs in these constructions (see <i>ExSyn</i> 182-89). </p>
