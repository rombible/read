<A NAME="324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=103><b>sn</b> <i>Inspired by God. </i>Some have connected this adjective in a different way and translated it as &#8220;every inspired scripture is also useful.&#8221; But this violates the parallelism of the two adjectives in the sentence, and the arrangement of words makes clear that both should be taken as predicate adjectives: &#8220;<i>every scripture is inspired&#8230;and useful</i>.&#8221; </p>
