<A NAME="323"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=102><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;All scripture.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> There is very little difference in sense between <i>every scripture</i> (emphasizing the individual portions) and &#8220;all scripture&#8221; (emphasizing the composite whole). The former option is preferred, because it fits the normal use of the word &#8220;all/every&#8221; in Greek (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#8118;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">pas</font>) as well as Paul&#8217;s normal sense for the word &#8220;scripture&#8221; in the singular without the article, as here. So <i>every scripture</i> means &#8220;every individual portion of scripture.&#8221;</p>
