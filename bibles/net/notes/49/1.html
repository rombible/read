<a name="12"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2><b>tc</b> The earliest and most important <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> omit &#8220;in Ephesus&#8221; (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* B* 6 1739 [Mcion<sup>T,E</sup>]), yet the opening line of this epistle makes little sense without the phrase (&#8220;to the saints who are and are faithful&#8230;&#8221;? or perhaps &#8220;to the saints who are also faithful,&#8221; though with this sense the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8022;&#963;&#953;&#957;</font> [<font face="Greektl">ousin</font>] is redundant and the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> [<font face="Greektl">kai</font>] is treated somewhat unnaturally). What is interesting is Marcion&#8217;s canon list which speaks of the letter to the <i>Laodiceans</i> among Paul&#8217;s authentic epistles. This, coupled with some internal evidence that the writer did not know his audience personally (cf. 1:15; 3:2; absence of personal names throughout), suggests that Ephesians was an encyclical letter, intended for more than one audience. Does this mean that the shorter reading is to be preferred? Yes and no. A plausible scenario is as follows, assuming Pauline authorship (though this is strongly contested today; for arguments on behalf of Pauline authorship, see M. Barth, <i>Ephesians</i> [AB 34], 1:36-50; P. T. O&#8217;Brien, <i>Ephesians</i>, 4-47; and H. W. Hoehner, <i>Ephesians</i>, 2-61): Paul sent the letter from Rome, intending it first to go to Ephesus. At the same time, Colossians was dispatched. Going counterclockwise through Asia Minor, this letter would first come to Ephesus, the port of entry, then to Laodicea, then Colossae. Tychicus&#8217; instructions may well have been for each church to &#8220;fill in the blank&#8221; on the address line. The church at Ephesus would have certainly made the most copies, being Paul&#8217;s home base for nearly three years. Hence, most of the surviving copies have &#8220;in Ephesus&#8221; in v. 1 (so <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>2</sup> A B<sup>2</sup> D F G <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 0278 33 1881 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> latt sy co). But one might expect a hint of evidence that Laodicea also made a few copies: Both Marcion&#8217;s list and Col 4:16 may well imply this. What is to account for the early Alexandrian evidence, then? These <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> were perhaps made from a very early copy, one reflecting the blank line before each church filled it in. Although it is of course only speculation (as is necessary in a historical investigation lacking some of the pieces to the puzzle), this scenario accounts for all of the data: (1) &#8220;in Ephesus&#8221; in most <span class="smallcaps">mss</span>; (2) Laodicea in Marcion&#8217;s list and Col 4:16; (3) the lack of an addressee in the earliest witnesses; (4) why the earliest witnesses&#8217; reading must be rejected as <i>too</i> hard; and (5) why the author seems not to know the readership. In sum, is &#8220;in Ephesus&#8221; original? Yes and no. <i>Some</i> address belongs there; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#8127;&#917;&#966;&#941;&#963;&#8179;</font> (<font face="Greektl">en Efesw</font>) is the predominant address, but several other churches also received this circular letter as their own. For this reason the phrase has been placed in single brackets in the translation. NA<sup>27</sup> also lists the words in brackets, indicating doubt as to their authenticity.</p><p class="footnote"><b>map</b> For location see JP1-D2; JP2-D2; JP3-D2; JP4-D2.</p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=3><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;and faithful.&#8221; The construction in Greek (as well as Paul&#8217;s style [and even if this letter is not by Paul it follows the general style of Paul&#8217;s letters, with some modifications]) suggests that the saints are identical to the faithful; hence, the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) is best left untranslated. See M. Barth, <i>Ephesians </i>(AB 34), 1:68 and <i>ExSyn</i> 282.</p>

<a name="15"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=5><b>sn</b> Eph 1:3-14 comprises one long sentence in Greek, with three major sections. Each section ends with a note of praise for God (vv. 6, 12, 14), focusing on a different member of the Trinity. After an opening summary of all the saints&#8217; spiritual blessings (v. 3), the first section (vv. 4-6) offers up praise that the Father has chosen us in eternity past; the second section (vv. 7-12) offers up praise that the Son has redeemed us in the historical past (i.e., at the cross); the third section (vv. 13-14) offers up praise that the Holy Spirit has sealed us in our personal past, at the point of conversion.</p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=6><b>tn</b> There is no verb in the Greek text; either the optative (&#8220;be&#8221;) or the indicative (&#8220;is&#8221;) can be supplied. The meaning of the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#8016;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#951;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">euloghtos</font>), the author&#8217;s intention at this point in the epistle, and the literary genre of this material must all come into play to determine which is the preferred nuance. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#8016;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#951;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font> as an adjective can mean either that one is praised or that one is blessed, that is, in a place of favor and benefit. The meaning &#8220;blessed&#8221; would be more naturally paired with an indicative verb here and would suggest that blessedness is an intrinsic part of God&#8217;s character. The meaning &#8220;praised&#8221; would be more naturally paired with an optative verb here and would suggest that God ought to be praised. Pauline style in the epistles generally moves from statements to obligations, expressing the reality first and then the believer&#8217;s necessary response, which would favor the indicative. However, many scholars regard Eph 1:3-14 as a <i>berakah </i>psalm (cf. A. T. Lincoln, <i>Ephesians </i>[WBC], 10-11). Rooted in the OT and Jewish worship, <i>berakah </i>psalms were songs of praise in which the worshiper gave praise to God; this would favor the optative (although not all scholars are agreed on this genre classification here; see H. W. Hoehner, <i>Ephesians</i>, 153-59, for discussion and an alternate conclusion). When considered as a whole, although a decision is difficult, the indicative seems to fit all the factors better. The author seems to be pointing to who God is and what he has done for believers in this section; the indicative more naturally fits that emphasis. Cf. also 2 Cor 1:3; 1 Pet 1:3.</p>

Verse 4 expresses the reason why God the Father is blessed (cf. BDAG 494 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#952;&#8061;&#962;</font> 3).</p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=9><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;in him.&#8221;</p>
<a name="110"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=10><b>sn</b> The Greek word translated <i>unblemished</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8061;&#956;&#959;&#965;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">amwmous</font>) is often used of an acceptable paschal lamb. Christ, as our paschal lamb, is also said to be unblemished (Heb 9:14; 1 Pet 1:19). Since believers are in Christ, God views them positionally and will make them ultimately without blemish as well (Jude 24; Eph 5:27; Col 1:22).</p>
<a name="111"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=11><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;before him.&#8221;</p>
<a name="112"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=12><b>tn</b> The prepositional phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#7936;&#947;&#940;&#960;&#8131;</font> (<font face="Greektl">en agaph</font>, &#8220;in love&#8221;) may modify one of three words or phrases: (1) &#8220;chose,&#8221; (2) &#8220;holy and unblemished,&#8221; both in v. 4, or (3) &#8220;by predestining&#8221; in v. 5. If it modifies &#8220;chose,&#8221; it refers to God&#8217;s motivation in that election, but this option is unlikely because of the placement of the prepositional phrase far away from the verb. The other two options are more likely. If it modifies &#8220;holy and unblemished,&#8221; it specifies that our holiness cannot be divorced from love. This view is in keeping with the author&#8217;s use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#947;&#940;&#960;&#951;</font> to refer often to human love in Ephesians, but the placement of the prepositional phrase not immediately following the words it modifies would be slightly awkward. If it modifies &#8220;by predestining&#8221; (v. 5), again the motivation of God&#8217;s choice is love. This would fit the focus of the passage on God&#8217;s gracious actions toward believers, but it could be considered slightly redundant in that God&#8217;s predestination itself proves his love.</p>
<a name="113"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=13><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;by predestining.&#8221; Verse 5 begins with an aorist participle dependent on the main verb in v. 4 (&#8220;chose&#8221;). </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>By predestining. </i>The aorist participle may be translated either causally (&#8220;because he predestined,&#8221; &#8220;having predestined&#8221;) or instrumentally (&#8220;by predestining&#8221;). A causal nuance would suggest that God&#8217;s predestination of certain individuals prompted his choice of them. An instrumental nuance would suggest that the means by which God&#8217;s choice was accomplished was by predestination. The instrumental view is somewhat more likely in light of normal Greek syntax (i.e., an aorist participle <i>following</i> an aorist main verb is more likely to be instrumental than causal).</p>
<a name="114"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=14><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;to himself&#8221; after &#8220;through Jesus Christ.&#8221;</p>
<a name="115"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=15><b>tn</b> The Greek term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#965;&#7985;&#959;&#952;&#949;&#963;&#943;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Juioqesia</font>) was originally a legal technical term for adoption as a son with full rights of inheritance. BDAG 1024 s.v. notes, &#8220;a legal t.t. of &#8216;adoption&#8217; of children, in our lit., i.e. in Paul, only in a transferred sense of a transcendent filial relationship between God and humans (with the legal aspect, not gender specificity, as major semantic component).&#8221; Although some modern translations remove the filial sense completely and render the term merely &#8220;adoption&#8221; (cf. NAB, ESV), the retention of this component of meaning was accomplished in the present translation by the phrase &#8220;as&#8230;sons.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Adoption as his sons</i> is different from spiritual birth as children. All true believers have been born as children of God and will be adopted as sons of God. The adoption is both a future reality, and in some sense, already true. To be adopted as a son means to have the full rights of an heir. Thus, although in the ancient world, only boys could be adopted as sons, in God&#8217;s family all children &#8211; both male and female &#8211; are adopted.</p>

The translation above has retained a literal rendering in order to make clear the relationship of this phrase to the other two similar phrases in v. 12 and 14, which affect the way one divides the material in the passage.</p>

The participle has been translated here with the temporal nuance to allow for means to also be a possible interpretation. If the translation focused instead upon means, the temporal nuance would be lost as the time frame for the action of the participle would become indistinct.</p>

Rom 1:13; 3:25) and thus more likely refers to Christ.</p>
<a name="125"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=25><b>tn</b> The precise meaning of the infinitive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#945;&#954;&#949;&#966;&#945;&#955;&#945;&#953;&#8061;&#963;&#945;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anakefalaiwsasqai</font>) in v. 10 is difficult to determine since it was used relatively infrequently in Greek literature and only twice in the NT (here and Rom 13:9). While there have been several suggestions, three deserve mention: (1) &#8220;To sum up.&#8221; In Rom 13:9, using the same term, the author there says that the law may be &#8220;<i>summarized</i> in one command, to love your neighbor as yourself.&#8221; The idea then in Eph 1:10 would be that all things in heaven and on earth can be summed up and <i>made sense out of</i> in relation to Christ. (2) &#8220;To renew.&#8221; If this is the nuance of the verb then all things in heaven and earth, after their plunge into sin and ruin, are renewed by the coming of Christ and his redemption. (3) &#8220;To head up.&#8221; In this translation the idea is that Christ, in the fullness of the times, has been exalted so as to be appointed as the ruler (i.e., &#8220;head&#8221;) over all things in heaven and earth (including the church). That this is perhaps the best understanding of the verb is evidenced by the repeated theme of Christ&#8217;s exaltation and reign in Ephesians and by the connection to the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#949;&#966;&#945;&#955;&#8053;-</font> (<font face="Greektl">kefalh-</font>) language of 1:22 (cf. Schlier, <i>TDNT </i>3:682; L&amp;N 63.8; M. Barth, <i>Ephesians</i> [AB 34], 1:89-92; <i>contra</i> A. T. Lincoln, <i>Ephesians </i>[WBC], 32-33).</p>

Verse 11 repeats the reference with a relative pronoun (&#8220;in whom&#8221;) &#8211; again, at the expense of good Greek style. Although the syntax is awkward, the theology is rich. This is not the first time that a NT writer was so overcome with awe for his Lord that he seems to have lost control of his pen. Indeed, it happened frequently enough that some have labeled their christologically motivated solecisms an &#8220;apostolic disease.&#8221;</p>

<a name="129"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=29><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;we were appointed by lot.&#8221; The notion of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#955;&#951;&#961;&#972;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">klhrow</font>) in the OT was to &#8220;appoint a portion by lot&#8221; (the more frequent cognate verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#955;&#951;&#961;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#969;</font> [<font face="Greektl">klhronomew</font>] meant &#8220;obtain a portion by lot&#8221;). In the passive, as here, the idea is that &#8220;we were appointed [as a portion] by lot&#8221; (BDAG 548 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#955;&#951;&#961;&#972;&#969;</font> 1). The words &#8220;God&#8217;s own&#8221; have been supplied in the translation to clarify this sense of the verb. An alternative interpretation is that believers receive a portion as an inheritance: &#8220;In Christ we too have been appointed a portion of the inheritance.&#8221; See H. W. Hoehner, <i>Ephesians</i>, 226-27, for discussion on this interpretive issue.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>God&#8217;s own possession</i>. Although God is not mentioned explicitly in the Greek text, it is clear from the context that he has chosen believers for himself.

In the NT the term is used only figuratively of the Holy Spirit as the <i>down payment </i>of the blessings promised by God (it is used also in 2 Cor 1:22 and 5:5). In the &#8220;already &#8211; not yet&#8221; scheme of the NT the possession of the Spirit now by believers (&#8220;already&#8221;) can be viewed as a guarantee that God will give them the balance of the promised blessings in the future (&#8220;not yet&#8221;).</p>

Most witnesses, especially the later ones (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>2</sup> D<sup>1</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> latt sa), read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7936;&#947;&#940;&#960;&#951;&#957; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#949;&#7984;&#962; &#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962; &#7937;&#947;&#943;&#959;&#965;&#962;</font>. Externally, the shorter reading is superior. Internally, the omission of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7936;&#947;&#940;&#960;&#951;&#957;</font> is a significantly harder reading, for the saints become an object of faith on par with the Lord Jesus. If this reading is authentic, however, the force of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pisti&quot;</font>) is probably closer to &#8220;faithfulness,&#8221; a meaning that could perhaps be suitable toward both the Lord and the saints. Nevertheless, if the shorter reading is authentic, later scribes would no doubt have been tempted to alter it. With the parallel in Col 1:4 at hand, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7936;&#947;&#940;&#960;&#951;&#957;</font> would have been the most obvious phrase to add. (<i>TCGNT</i> 533 suggests that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7971;&#957; &#7956;&#967;&#949;&#964;&#949;</font> would have been added instead of the second <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8053;&#957;</font> if the shorter reading were original, in conformity with Col 1:4, but this is not necessarily so: Scribes often altered the text as minimally as possible, and since the second <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8053;&#957;</font> was already present, replacing it with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7971;&#957; &#7956;&#967;&#949;&#964;&#949;</font>, when the meaning was not significantly different from the second <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8053;&#957;</font>, seems unlikely.) Further, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#947;&#940;&#960;&#951;&#957;</font> comes after &#8220;saints&#8221; (thus, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8052;&#957; &#949;&#7984;&#962; &#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962; &#7937;&#947;&#943;&#959;&#965;&#962;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#947;&#940;&#960;&#951;&#957;</font>) in some witnesses (81 104 326 365 1175), and the second <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8053;&#957;</font> is lacking (thus, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7936;&#947;&#940;&#960;&#951;&#957; &#949;&#7984;&#962; &#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962; &#7937;&#947;&#943;&#959;&#965;&#962;</font>) in others (D* F G). Such a floating text normally indicates inauthenticity. On the other hand, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7936;&#947;&#940;&#960;&#951;&#957;</font> could easily have dropped out of the text by way of haplography, the Alexandrian scribes&#8217; eyes skipping from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8053;&#957;</font> to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8053;&#957;</font>. The weak first declension feminine article-noun-article construction is common enough in the NT, occurring over 40 times, yet in four of these texts there is some ms evidence for an omission similar to Eph 1:15 (Rom 11:17; 2 Tim 3:10; Rev 11:2; 21:9). But in none of these places is the Alexandrian testimony united in the omission as it is here. Further, a wholesale Alexandrian omission of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7936;&#947;&#940;&#960;&#951;&#957;</font> presupposes a much stronger genealogical relation among the Alexandrian <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> than many scholars would embrace. What seems to tip the scales in favor of the longer reading, however, is the intrinsic evidence: The question of whether <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#962;</font> could be used to mean faithfulness in the general sense toward both the Lord <i>and the saints</i> is quite problematic. All in all, a decision is difficult, but the longer reading is, with hesitation, preferred. </p>

Some take it to mean &#8220;the Spirit,&#8221; others &#8220;a spirit,&#8221; and still others &#8220;spiritual.&#8221; (1) If &#8220;the Spirit&#8221; is meant, the idea must be a metonymy of cause for effect, because the author had just indicated in vv. 13-14 that the Spirit was already given (hence, there is no need for him to pray that he be given again). But the effect of the Spirit is wisdom and revelation. (2) If &#8220;a spirit&#8221; is meant, the idea may be that the readers will have the ability to gain wisdom and insight as they read Paul&#8217;s letters, but the exact meaning of &#8220;a spirit&#8221; remains ambiguous. (3) To take the genitives following <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#957;&#949;&#8166;&#956;&#945;</font> as <i>attributed</i> genitives (see <i>ExSyn</i> 89-91), in which the head noun (&#8220;S/spirit&#8221;) functions semantically like an adjective (&#8220;spiritual&#8221;) is both grammatically probable and exegetically consistent.</p>

The longer reading thus looks to be a clarifying gloss, as is frequently found in the Byzantine and Western traditions.

Although the participle follows the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jina</font>) of v. 17, it is awkward grammatically in the clause. Further, perfect adverbial participles are usually causal in NT Greek. Finally, the context both here and throughout Ephesians seems to emphasize the motif of light as a property belonging to believers. Thus, it seems that the author is saying, &#8220;I know that you are saved, that you have had the blinders of the devil removed; because of this, I can now pray that you will fully understand and see the light of God&#8217;s glorious revelation.&#8221; Hence, the translation takes the participle to form a part of the basis for the prayer.</p>

There is a natural cadence to the three genitive expressions (<i>hope <b>of</b> his calling</i>, <i>wealth <b>of</b> his glorious inheritance</i>, and <i>extraordinary greatness <b>of</b> his power</i>). The essence of the prayer is seen here. Paraphrased it reads as follows: &#8220;Since you are enlightened by God&#8217;s Spirit, I pray that you may comprehend the hope to which he has called you, the spiritual riches that await the saints in glory, and the spiritual power that is available to the saints now.&#8221; Thus, the prayer focuses on all three temporal aspects of our salvation as these are embedded in the genitives &#8211; the past (<i>calling</i>), the future (<i>inheritance</i>), and the present (<i>power toward us who believe</i>).</p>

The participle has been translated here with the temporal nuance to allow for means to also be a possible interpretation.
