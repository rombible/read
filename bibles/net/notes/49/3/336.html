<A NAME="336"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=141><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Or who is your glory?&#8221; The relative pronoun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7973;&#964;&#953;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jhti&quot;</font>), if divided differently, would become <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7972; &#964;&#943;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">h ti&quot;</font>). Since there were no word breaks in the original <sc>mss, either word division is possible. The force of the question would be that for the readers to become discouraged over Paul&#8217;s imprisonment would mean that they were no longer trusting in God&#8217;s sovereignty.</p>
