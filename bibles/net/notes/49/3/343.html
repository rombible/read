<A NAME="343"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=148><b>sn</b> The object of these dimensions is not stated in the text. Interpreters have suggested a variety of referents for this unstated object, including the cross of Christ, the heavenly Jerusalem (which is then sometimes linked to the Church), God&#8217;s power, the fullness of salvation given in Christ, the Wisdom of God, and the love of Christ. Of these interpretations, the last two are the most plausible. Associations from Wisdom literature favor the Wisdom of God, but the immediate context favors the love of Christ. For detailed discussion of these interpretive options, see A. T. Lincoln, <i>Ephesians </i>(WBC), 207-13, who ultimately favors the love of Christ.</p>
