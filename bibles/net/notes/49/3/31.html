<A NAME="31"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=106><b>tc</b> Several early and important witnesses, chiefly of the Western text (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* D* F G [365]), lack <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Ihsou</font>, &#8220;Jesus&#8221;) here, while most Alexandrian and Byzantine <sc>mss (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>1</sup> A B [C] D<sup>1</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 33 1739 [1881] <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat sy bo) have the word. However, because of the Western text&#8217;s proclivities to add or delete to the text, seemingly at whim, serious doubts should be attached to the shorter reading. It is strengthened, however, by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>&#8217;s support. Nevertheless, since both <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> and D were corrected with the addition of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;</font>, their testimony might be questioned. Further, in uncial script the <i>nomina sacra</i> here could have led to missing a word by way of homoioteleuton (<font face="Greek Uncials">cMuiMu</font>). At the same time, in light of the rarity of scribal omission of <i>nomina sacra</i> (see <i>TCGNT</i> 582, n. 1), a decision for inclusion of the word here must be tentative. NA<sup>27</sup> rightly places <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;</font> in brackets.</p>
