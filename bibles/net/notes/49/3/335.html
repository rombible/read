<A NAME="335"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=140><b>sn</b> <i>Which. </i>The antecedent (i.e., the word or concept to which this clause refers back) may be either &#8220;what I am suffering for you&#8221; or the larger concept of the recipients not losing heart over Paul&#8217;s suffering for them. The relative pronoun &#8220;<i>which</i>&#8221; is attracted to the predicate nominative &#8220;<i>glory</i>&#8221; in its gender and number (feminine singular), making the antecedent ambiguous. Paul&#8217;s suffering for them could be viewed as their glory (cf. Col 1:24 for a parallel) in that his suffering has brought about their salvation, but if so his suffering must be viewed as more than his present imprisonment in Rome; it would be a general description of his ministry overall (cf. 2 Cor 11:23-27). The other option is that the author is implicitly arguing that the believers have <i>continued</i> to have courage in the midst of his trials (as <i>not to lose heart</i> suggests) and that this is their glory. Philippians 1:27-28 offers an interesting parallel: The believers&#8217; courage in the face of adversity is a sign of their salvation.</p>
