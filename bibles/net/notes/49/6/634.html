<A NAME="634"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=267><b>sn</b> The Greek word translated <i>shield</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#965;&#961;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">qureos</font>) refers to the Roman soldier&#8217;s large rectangular wooden shield, called in Latin <i>scutum</i>, about 4 ft (1.2 m) high, covered with leather on the outside. Before a battle in which flaming arrows might be shot at them, the soldiers wet the leather covering with water to extinguish the arrows. The Roman legionaries could close ranks with these shields, the first row holding theirs edge to edge in front, and the rows behind holding the shields above their heads. In this formation they were practically invulnerable to arrows, rocks, and even spears.</p>
