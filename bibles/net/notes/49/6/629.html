<A NAME="629"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=262><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;girding your waist with truth.&#8221; In this entire section the author is painting a metaphor for his readers based on the attire of a Roman soldier prepared for battle and its similarity to the Christian prepared to do battle against spiritually evil forces. Behind the expression &#8220;<i>with truth</i>&#8221; is probably the genitive idea &#8220;belt of truth.&#8221; Since this is an appositional genitive (i.e., belt <i>which is </i>truth), the author simply left unsaid the idea of the belt and mentioned only his real focus, namely, the <i>truth</i>. (The analogy would have been completely understandable to his 1st century readers.) The idea of the belt is supplied in the translation to clarify the sense in English. </p>
