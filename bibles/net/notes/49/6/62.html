<A NAME="62"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=235><b>tc</b> B D* F G as well as a few versional and patristic representatives lack &#8220;in the Lord&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#954;&#965;&#961;&#943;&#8179;</font>, <font face="Greektl">en kuriw</font>), while the phrase is well represented in <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A D<sup>1</sup> I<sup>vid</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 0278 0285 33 1739 1881 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> sy co. Scribes may have thought that the phrase could be regarded a qualifier on the kind of parents a child should obey (viz., only Christian parents), and would thus be tempted to delete the phrase to counter such an interpretation. It is unlikely that the phrase would have been added, since the form used to express such sentiment in this <i>Haustafel </i>is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8033;&#962; &#964;&#8183; &#954;&#965;&#961;&#943;&#8179;</font>/<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8183;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jw&quot; tw kuriw</font>/<font face="Greektl">Cristw</font>, &#8220;as to the Lord/Christ&#8221;; see 5:22; 6:5). Even though the witnesses for the omission are impressive, it is more likely that the phrase was deleted than added by scribal activity.</p>
