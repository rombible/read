<A NAME="637"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=270><b>tn</b> Both &#8220;pray&#8221; and &#8220;be alert&#8221; are participles in the Greek text (&#8220;praying&#8230;being alert&#8221;). Both are probably instrumental, loosely connected with all of the preceding instructions. As such, they are not additional commands to do but instead are the means through which the prior instructions are accomplished.</p>
