<A NAME="31"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=106><b>tc</b> Several early and important witnesses, chiefly of the Western text (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* D* F G [365]), lack <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Ihsou</font>, &#8220;Jesus&#8221;) here, while most Alexandrian and Byzantine <sc>mss (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>1</sup> A B [C] D<sup>1</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 33 1739 [1881] <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat sy bo) have the word. However, because of the Western text&#8217;s proclivities to add or delete to the text, seemingly at whim, serious doubts should be attached to the shorter reading. It is strengthened, however, by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>&#8217;s support. Nevertheless, since both <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> and D were corrected with the addition of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;</font>, their testimony might be questioned. Further, in uncial script the <i>nomina sacra</i> here could have led to missing a word by way of homoioteleuton (<font face="Greek Uncials">cMuiMu</font>). At the same time, in light of the rarity of scribal omission of <i>nomina sacra</i> (see <i>TCGNT</i> 582, n. 1), a decision for inclusion of the word here must be tentative. NA<sup>27</sup> rightly places <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;</font> in brackets.</p>
<A NAME="32"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=107><b>sn</b> <i>If indeed. </i>The author is not doubting <i>whether</i> his audience has heard, but is rather using provocative language (<i>if indeed</i>) to engage his audience in thinking about the magnificence of God&#8217;s grace. However, in English translation, the apodosis (&#8220;then&#8221;-clause) does not come until v. 13, leaving the protasis (&#8220;if&#8221;-clause) dangling. Eph 3:2-7 constitute one sentence in Greek.</p>

<A NAME="319"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=124><b>sn</b> In Pauline writings <i>saints</i> means any true believer. Thus for Paul to view himself as <i>less than the least of all the saints</i> is to view himself as the most unworthy object of Christ&#8217;s redemption.</p>
<A NAME="320"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=125><b>sn</b> The parallel phrases <i>to proclaim</i> and <i>to enlighten</i> which follow indicate why God&#8217;s grace was manifested to Paul. Grace was not something just to be received, but to be shared with others (cf. Acts 13:47).</p>
<A NAME="321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=126><b>tn</b> There is a possible causative nuance in the Greek verb, but this is difficult to convey in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=127><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;what is the plan of the divine secret.&#8221; Earlier the author had used <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#7984;&#954;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#943;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">oikonomia</font>; here &#8220;plan&#8221;) to refer to his own &#8220;stewardship&#8221; (v. 2). But now he is speaking about the content of this secret, not his own activity in relation to it.</p>
<A NAME="323"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=128><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;for eternity,&#8221; or perhaps &#8220;from the Aeons.&#8221; Cf. 2:2, 7.</p>
<A NAME="324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=129><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;by God.&#8221; It is possible that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">en</font>) plus the dative here indicates agency, that is, that God has performed the action of hiding the secret. However, this usage of the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957;</font> is quite rare in the NT, and even though here it does follow a perfect passive verb as in the Classical idiom, it is more likely that a different nuance is intended.</p>
<A NAME="325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=130><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;that.&#8221; Verse 10 is a subordinate clause to the verb &#8220;enlighten&#8221; in v. 9.</p>
<A NAME="326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=131><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;manifold wisdom,&#8221; &#8220;wisdom in its rich variety.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=132><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;according to.&#8221; The verse is a prepositional phrase subordinate to v. 10.</p>
<A NAME="328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=133><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;access in confidence.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="329"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=134><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;to God&#8221; is not in the text, but is clearly implied by the preceding, &#8220;access.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="330"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=135><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;through,&#8221; &#8220;by way of.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=136><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;his.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="332"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=137><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;faith in him.&#8221; A decision is difficult here. Though traditionally translated &#8220;faith in Jesus Christ,&#8221; an increasing number of NT scholars are arguing that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#962; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pisti&quot; Cristou</font>) and similar phrases in Paul (here and in Rom 3:22, 26; Gal 2:16, 20; 3:22; Phil 3:9) involve a <i>subjective</i> genitive and mean &#8220;Christ&#8217;s faith&#8221; or &#8220;Christ&#8217;s faithfulness&#8221; (cf., e.g., G. Howard, &#8220;The &#8216;Faith of Christ&#8217;,&#8221; <i>ExpTim</i> 85 [1974]: 212-15; R. B. Hays, <i>The Faith of Jesus Christ</i> [SBLDS]; Morna D. Hooker, &#8220;<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#928;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#962; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</font>,&#8221; <i>NTS</i> 35 [1989]: 321-42). Noteworthy among the arguments for the subjective genitive view is that when <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#962;</font> takes a personal genitive it is almost never an objective genitive (cf. Matt 9:2, 22, 29; Mark 2:5; 5:34; 10:52; Luke 5:20; 7:50; 8:25, 48; 17:19; 18:42; 22:32; Rom 1:8; 12; 3:3; 4:5, 12, 16; 1 Cor 2:5; 15:14, 17; 2 Cor 10:15; Phil 2:17; Col 1:4; 2:5; 1 Thess 1:8; 3:2, 5, 10; 2 Thess 1:3; Titus 1:1; Phlm 6; 1 Pet 1:9, 21; 2 Pet 1:5). On the other hand, the <i>objective</i> genitive view has its adherents: A. Hultgren, &#8220;The <i>Pistis Christou</i> Formulations in Paul,&#8221; <i>NovT</i> 22 (1980): 248-63; J. D. G. Dunn, &#8220;Once More, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#928;&#921;&#931;&#932;&#921;&#931; &#935;&#929;&#921;&#931;&#932;&#927;&#933;</font>,&#8221; <i>SBL Seminar Papers</i>, <i>1991, </i>730-44. Most commentaries on Romans and Galatians usually side with the objective view.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Because of Christ&#8217;s faithfulness. </i>Though Paul elsewhere teaches justification by faith, this presupposes that the object of our faith is reliable and worthy of such faith.</p>
<A NAME="333"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=138><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;I ask.&#8221; No direct object is given in Greek, leaving room for the possibility that either &#8220;God&#8221; (since the verb is often associated with prayer) or &#8220;you&#8221; is in view.</p>
<A NAME="334"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=139><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;my trials on your behalf.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="335"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=140><b>sn</b> <i>Which. </i>The antecedent (i.e., the word or concept to which this clause refers back) may be either &#8220;what I am suffering for you&#8221; or the larger concept of the recipients not losing heart over Paul&#8217;s suffering for them. The relative pronoun &#8220;<i>which</i>&#8221; is attracted to the predicate nominative &#8220;<i>glory</i>&#8221; in its gender and number (feminine singular), making the antecedent ambiguous. Paul&#8217;s suffering for them could be viewed as their glory (cf. Col 1:24 for a parallel) in that his suffering has brought about their salvation, but if so his suffering must be viewed as more than his present imprisonment in Rome; it would be a general description of his ministry overall (cf. 2 Cor 11:23-27). The other option is that the author is implicitly arguing that the believers have <i>continued</i> to have courage in the midst of his trials (as <i>not to lose heart</i> suggests) and that this is their glory. Philippians 1:27-28 offers an interesting parallel: The believers&#8217; courage in the face of adversity is a sign of their salvation.</p>
<A NAME="336"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=141><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Or who is your glory?&#8221; The relative pronoun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7973;&#964;&#953;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jhti&quot;</font>), if divided differently, would become <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7972; &#964;&#943;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">h ti&quot;</font>). Since there were no word breaks in the original <sc>mss, either word division is possible. The force of the question would be that for the readers to become discouraged over Paul&#8217;s imprisonment would mean that they were no longer trusting in God&#8217;s sovereignty.</p>
<A NAME="337"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=142><b>sn</b> <i>For this reason</i> resumes the point begun in v. 1, after a long parenthesis.</p>
<A NAME="338"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=143><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;I bend my knees.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="339"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=144><b>tc</b> Most Western and Byzantine witnesses, along with a few others (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>2</sup> D F G <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 0278 1881 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat sy), have &#8220;of our Lord Jesus Christ&#8221; after &#8220;Father,&#8221; but such an edifying phrase cannot explain the rise of the reading that lacks it, especially when the shorter reading is attested by early and important witnesses such as <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* A B C P 6 33 81 365 1175 1739 co Or Hier.</p>

<A NAME="343"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=148><b>sn</b> The object of these dimensions is not stated in the text. Interpreters have suggested a variety of referents for this unstated object, including the cross of Christ, the heavenly Jerusalem (which is then sometimes linked to the Church), God&#8217;s power, the fullness of salvation given in Christ, the Wisdom of God, and the love of Christ. Of these interpretations, the last two are the most plausible. Associations from Wisdom literature favor the Wisdom of God, but the immediate context favors the love of Christ. For detailed discussion of these interpretive options, see A. T. Lincoln, <i>Ephesians </i>(WBC), 207-13, who ultimately favors the love of Christ.</p>
<A NAME="344"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=149><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;with.&#8221;</p>
