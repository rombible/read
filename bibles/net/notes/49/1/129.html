<a name="129"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=29><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;we were appointed by lot.&#8221; The notion of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#955;&#951;&#961;&#972;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">klhrow</font>) in the OT was to &#8220;appoint a portion by lot&#8221; (the more frequent cognate verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#955;&#951;&#961;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#969;</font> [<font face="Greektl">klhronomew</font>] meant &#8220;obtain a portion by lot&#8221;). In the passive, as here, the idea is that &#8220;we were appointed [as a portion] by lot&#8221; (BDAG 548 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#955;&#951;&#961;&#972;&#969;</font> 1). The words &#8220;God&#8217;s own&#8221; have been supplied in the translation to clarify this sense of the verb. An alternative interpretation is that believers receive a portion as an inheritance: &#8220;In Christ we too have been appointed a portion of the inheritance.&#8221; See H. W. Hoehner, <i>Ephesians</i>, 226-27, for discussion on this interpretive issue.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>God&#8217;s own possession</i>. Although God is not mentioned explicitly in the Greek text, it is clear from the context that he has chosen believers for himself. Just as with the nation Israel, the church is God&#8217;s chosen portion or possession (cf. Deut 32:8-9).</p>
