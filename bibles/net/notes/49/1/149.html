<a name="149"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=49><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the hope to which he has called you.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>The hope of his calling. </i>The translation is more formally equivalent for this and the following two phrases, because of the apparently intentional literary force of the original. There is a natural cadence to the three genitive expressions (<i>hope <b>of</b> his calling</i>, <i>wealth <b>of</b> his glorious inheritance</i>, and <i>extraordinary greatness <b>of</b> his power</i>). The essence of the prayer is seen here. Paraphrased it reads as follows: &#8220;Since you are enlightened by God&#8217;s Spirit, I pray that you may comprehend the hope to which he has called you, the spiritual riches that await the saints in glory, and the spiritual power that is available to the saints now.&#8221; Thus, the prayer focuses on all three temporal aspects of our salvation as these are embedded in the genitives &#8211; the past (<i>calling</i>), the future (<i>inheritance</i>), and the present (<i>power toward us who believe</i>).</p>
