<a name="145"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=45><b>tn</b><i> </i>Or &#8220;the Spirit of wisdom and revelation,&#8221; or &#8220;a spirit of wisdom and revelation.&#8221; Verse 17 involves a complex exegetical problem revolving around the Greek term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#957;&#949;&#8166;&#956;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pneuma</font>). Some take it to mean &#8220;the Spirit,&#8221; others &#8220;a spirit,&#8221; and still others &#8220;spiritual.&#8221; (1) If &#8220;the Spirit&#8221; is meant, the idea must be a metonymy of cause for effect, because the author had just indicated in vv. 13-14 that the Spirit was already given (hence, there is no need for him to pray that he be given again). But the effect of the Spirit is wisdom and revelation. (2) If &#8220;a spirit&#8221; is meant, the idea may be that the readers will have the ability to gain wisdom and insight as they read Paul&#8217;s letters, but the exact meaning of &#8220;a spirit&#8221; remains ambiguous. (3) To take the genitives following <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#957;&#949;&#8166;&#956;&#945;</font> as <i>attributed</i> genitives (see <i>ExSyn</i> 89-91), in which the head noun (&#8220;S/spirit&#8221;) functions semantically like an adjective (&#8220;spiritual&#8221;) is both grammatically probable and exegetically consistent.</p>
