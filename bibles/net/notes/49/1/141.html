Most witnesses, especially the later ones (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>2</sup> D<sup>1</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> latt sa), read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7936;&#947;&#940;&#960;&#951;&#957; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#949;&#7984;&#962; &#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962; &#7937;&#947;&#943;&#959;&#965;&#962;</font>. Externally, the shorter reading is superior. Internally, the omission of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7936;&#947;&#940;&#960;&#951;&#957;</font> is a significantly harder reading, for the saints become an object of faith on par with the Lord Jesus. If this reading is authentic, however, the force of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pisti&quot;</font>) is probably closer to &#8220;faithfulness,&#8221; a meaning that could perhaps be suitable toward both the Lord and the saints. Nevertheless, if the shorter reading is authentic, later scribes would no doubt have been tempted to alter it. With the parallel in Col 1:4 at hand, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7936;&#947;&#940;&#960;&#951;&#957;</font> would have been the most obvious phrase to add. (<i>TCGNT</i> 533 suggests that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7971;&#957; &#7956;&#967;&#949;&#964;&#949;</font> would have been added instead of the second <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8053;&#957;</font> if the shorter reading were original, in conformity with Col 1:4, but this is not necessarily so: Scribes often altered the text as minimally as possible, and since the second <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8053;&#957;</font> was already present, replacing it with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7971;&#957; &#7956;&#967;&#949;&#964;&#949;</font>, when the meaning was not significantly different from the second <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8053;&#957;</font>, seems unlikely.) Further, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#947;&#940;&#960;&#951;&#957;</font> comes after &#8220;saints&#8221; (thus, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8052;&#957; &#949;&#7984;&#962; &#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962; &#7937;&#947;&#943;&#959;&#965;&#962;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#947;&#940;&#960;&#951;&#957;</font>) in some witnesses (81 104 326 365 1175), and the second <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8053;&#957;</font> is lacking (thus, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7936;&#947;&#940;&#960;&#951;&#957; &#949;&#7984;&#962; &#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962; &#7937;&#947;&#943;&#959;&#965;&#962;</font>) in others (D* F G). Such a floating text normally indicates inauthenticity. On the other hand, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7936;&#947;&#940;&#960;&#951;&#957;</font> could easily have dropped out of the text by way of haplography, the Alexandrian scribes&#8217; eyes skipping from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8053;&#957;</font> to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8053;&#957;</font>. The weak first declension feminine article-noun-article construction is common enough in the NT, occurring over 40 times, yet in four of these texts there is some ms evidence for an omission similar to Eph 1:15 (Rom 11:17; 2 Tim 3:10; Rev 11:2; 21:9). But in none of these places is the Alexandrian testimony united in the omission as it is here. Further, a wholesale Alexandrian omission of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7936;&#947;&#940;&#960;&#951;&#957;</font> presupposes a much stronger genealogical relation among the Alexandrian <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> than many scholars would embrace. What seems to tip the scales in favor of the longer reading, however, is the intrinsic evidence: The question of whether <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#962;</font> could be used to mean faithfulness in the general sense toward both the Lord <i>and the saints</i> is quite problematic. All in all, a decision is difficult, but the longer reading is, with hesitation, preferred. </p>
