<a name="127"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=27><b>sn</b> <i>And the things on earth. </i>Verse 10 ends with &#8220;in him.&#8221; The redundancy keeps the focus on Christ at the expense of good Greek style. Verse 11 repeats the reference with a relative pronoun (&#8220;in whom&#8221;) &#8211; again, at the expense of good Greek style. Although the syntax is awkward, the theology is rich. This is not the first time that a NT writer was so overcome with awe for his Lord that he seems to have lost control of his pen. Indeed, it happened frequently enough that some have labeled their christologically motivated solecisms an &#8220;apostolic disease.&#8221;</p>
