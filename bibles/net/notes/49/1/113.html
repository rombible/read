An instrumental nuance would suggest that the means by which God&#8217;s choice was accomplished was by predestination. The instrumental view is somewhat more likely in light of normal Greek syntax (i.e., an aorist participle <i>following</i> an aorist main verb is more likely to be instrumental than causal).</p>
