<a name="144"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=44><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;glorious Father.&#8221; The genitive phrase &#8220;of glory&#8221; is most likely an attributive genitive. The literal translation &#8220;Father of glory&#8221; has been retained because of the parallelism with the first line of the verse: &#8220;the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory.&#8221;</p>
