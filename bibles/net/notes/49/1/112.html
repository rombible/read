<a name="112"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=12><b>tn</b> The prepositional phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#7936;&#947;&#940;&#960;&#8131;</font> (<font face="Greektl">en agaph</font>, &#8220;in love&#8221;) may modify one of three words or phrases: (1) &#8220;chose,&#8221; (2) &#8220;holy and unblemished,&#8221; both in v. 4, or (3) &#8220;by predestining&#8221; in v. 5. If it modifies &#8220;chose,&#8221; it refers to God&#8217;s motivation in that election, but this option is unlikely because of the placement of the prepositional phrase far away from the verb. The other two options are more likely. If it modifies &#8220;holy and unblemished,&#8221; it specifies that our holiness cannot be divorced from love. This view is in keeping with the author&#8217;s use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#947;&#940;&#960;&#951;</font> to refer often to human love in Ephesians, but the placement of the prepositional phrase not immediately following the words it modifies would be slightly awkward. If it modifies &#8220;by predestining&#8221; (v. 5), again the motivation of God&#8217;s choice is love. This would fit the focus of the passage on God&#8217;s gracious actions toward believers, but it could be considered slightly redundant in that God&#8217;s predestination itself proves his love.</p>
