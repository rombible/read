<a name="157"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=57><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;This power he exercised in Christ by raising him&#8221;; <i>Grk</i> &#8220;raising him.&#8221; The adverbial participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#947;&#949;&#943;&#961;&#945;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">egeiras</font>) could be understood as temporal (&#8220;when he raised [him]&#8221;), which would be contemporaneous to the action of the finite verb &#8220;he exercised&#8221; earlier in the verse, or as means (&#8220;by raising [him]&#8221;). The participle has been translated here with the temporal nuance to allow for means to also be a possible interpretation. If the translation focused instead upon means, the temporal nuance would be lost as the time frame for the action of the participle would become indistinct.</p>
