<a name="148"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=48><b>tn</b> The perfect participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#949;&#966;&#969;&#964;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#965;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pefwtismenou&quot;</font>) may either be part of the prayer (&#8220;that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened&#8221;) or part of the basis of the prayer (&#8220;since the eyes of your heart have been enlightened&#8221;). Although the participle follows the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jina</font>) of v. 17, it is awkward grammatically in the clause. Further, perfect adverbial participles are usually causal in NT Greek. Finally, the context both here and throughout Ephesians seems to emphasize the motif of light as a property belonging to believers. Thus, it seems that the author is saying, &#8220;I know that you are saved, that you have had the blinders of the devil removed; because of this, I can now pray that you will fully understand and see the light of God&#8217;s glorious revelation.&#8221; Hence, the translation takes the participle to form a part of the basis for the prayer.</p>
