<a name="16"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=6><b>tn</b> There is no verb in the Greek text; either the optative (&#8220;be&#8221;) or the indicative (&#8220;is&#8221;) can be supplied. The meaning of the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#8016;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#951;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">euloghtos</font>), the author&#8217;s intention at this point in the epistle, and the literary genre of this material must all come into play to determine which is the preferred nuance. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#8016;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#951;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font> as an adjective can mean either that one is praised or that one is blessed, that is, in a place of favor and benefit. The meaning &#8220;blessed&#8221; would be more naturally paired with an indicative verb here and would suggest that blessedness is an intrinsic part of God&#8217;s character. The meaning &#8220;praised&#8221; would be more naturally paired with an optative verb here and would suggest that God ought to be praised. Pauline style in the epistles generally moves from statements to obligations, expressing the reality first and then the believer&#8217;s necessary response, which would favor the indicative. However, many scholars regard Eph 1:3-14 as a <i>berakah </i>psalm (cf. A. T. Lincoln, <i>Ephesians </i>[WBC], 10-11). Rooted in the OT and Jewish worship, <i>berakah </i>psalms were songs of praise in which the worshiper gave praise to God; this would favor the optative (although not all scholars are agreed on this genre classification here; see H. W. Hoehner, <i>Ephesians</i>, 153-59, for discussion and an alternate conclusion). When considered as a whole, although a decision is difficult, the indicative seems to fit all the factors better. The author seems to be pointing to who God is and what he has done for believers in this section; the indicative more naturally fits that emphasis. Cf. also 2 Cor 1:3; 1 Pet 1:3.</p>
