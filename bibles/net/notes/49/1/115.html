<a name="115"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=15><b>tn</b> The Greek term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#965;&#7985;&#959;&#952;&#949;&#963;&#943;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Juioqesia</font>) was originally a legal technical term for adoption as a son with full rights of inheritance. BDAG 1024 s.v. notes, &#8220;a legal t.t. of &#8216;adoption&#8217; of children, in our lit., i.e. in Paul, only in a transferred sense of a transcendent filial relationship between God and humans (with the legal aspect, not gender specificity, as major semantic component).&#8221; Although some modern translations remove the filial sense completely and render the term merely &#8220;adoption&#8221; (cf. NAB, ESV), the retention of this component of meaning was accomplished in the present translation by the phrase &#8220;as&#8230;sons.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Adoption as his sons</i> is different from spiritual birth as children. All true believers have been born as children of God and will be adopted as sons of God. The adoption is both a future reality, and in some sense, already true. To be adopted as a son means to have the full rights of an heir. Thus, although in the ancient world, only boys could be adopted as sons, in God&#8217;s family all children &#8211; both male and female &#8211; are adopted.</p>
