<a name="110"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=10><b>sn</b> The Greek word translated <i>unblemished</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8061;&#956;&#959;&#965;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">amwmous</font>) is often used of an acceptable paschal lamb. Christ, as our paschal lamb, is also said to be unblemished (Heb 9:14; 1 Pet 1:19). Since believers are in Christ, God views them positionally and will make them ultimately without blemish as well (Jude 24; Eph 5:27; Col 1:22).</p>
