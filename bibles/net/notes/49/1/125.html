<a name="125"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=25><b>tn</b> The precise meaning of the infinitive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#945;&#954;&#949;&#966;&#945;&#955;&#945;&#953;&#8061;&#963;&#945;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anakefalaiwsasqai</font>) in v. 10 is difficult to determine since it was used relatively infrequently in Greek literature and only twice in the NT (here and Rom 13:9). While there have been several suggestions, three deserve mention: (1) &#8220;To sum up.&#8221; In Rom 13:9, using the same term, the author there says that the law may be &#8220;<i>summarized</i> in one command, to love your neighbor as yourself.&#8221; The idea then in Eph 1:10 would be that all things in heaven and on earth can be summed up and <i>made sense out of</i> in relation to Christ. (2) &#8220;To renew.&#8221; If this is the nuance of the verb then all things in heaven and earth, after their plunge into sin and ruin, are renewed by the coming of Christ and his redemption. (3) &#8220;To head up.&#8221; In this translation the idea is that Christ, in the fullness of the times, has been exalted so as to be appointed as the ruler (i.e., &#8220;head&#8221;) over all things in heaven and earth (including the church). That this is perhaps the best understanding of the verb is evidenced by the repeated theme of Christ&#8217;s exaltation and reign in Ephesians and by the connection to the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#949;&#966;&#945;&#955;&#8053;-</font> (<font face="Greektl">kefalh-</font>) language of 1:22 (cf. Schlier, <i>TDNT </i>3:682; L&amp;N 63.8; M. Barth, <i>Ephesians</i> [AB 34], 1:89-92; <i>contra</i> A. T. Lincoln, <i>Ephesians </i>[WBC], 32-33).</p>
