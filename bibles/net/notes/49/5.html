On the other hand, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8017;&#956;&#8118;&#962;</font> may have been motivated by the preceding <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8017;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jumin</font>) in 4:32 and second person verbs in 5:1, 2. Further, the flow of argument seems to require the first person pronoun. A decision is difficult to make, but the first person pronoun has a slightly greater probability of being original.</p>
<A NAME="54"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=191><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;an offering and sacrifice to God as a smell of fragrance.&#8221; The first expression, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#966;&#959;&#961;&#8048;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#952;&#965;&#963;&#943;&#945;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">prosforan kai qusian</font>), is probably a hendiadys and has been translated such that &#8220;sacrificial&#8221; modifies &#8220;offering.&#8221; The second expression, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#962; &#8000;&#963;&#956;&#8052;&#957; &#949;&#8016;&#969;&#948;&#943;&#945;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ei&quot; osmhn euwdia&quot;</font>, &#8220;as a smell of fragrance&#8221;) has been translated as &#8220;a fragrant offering&#8221;; see BDAG 728-29 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8000;&#963;&#956;&#8053;</font> 2.

<A NAME="512"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=199><b>tc</b> Several <sc>mss (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46</sup> D<sup>2 </sup><font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>) have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#957;&#949;&#973;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pneumatos</font>, &#8220;Spirit&#8221;) instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#966;&#969;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">fwtos</font>, &#8220;light&#8221;). Although most today regard <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#966;&#969;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font> as obviously original (UBS<sup>4</sup> gives it an &#8220;A&#8221; rating), a case could be made that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#957;&#949;&#973;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962;</font> is what the author wrote. First, although this is largely a Byzantine reading (D<sup>2</sup> often, if not normally, assimilates to the Byzantine text), <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46</sup> gives the reading much greater credibility. Internally, the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#966;&#969;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font> at the end of v. 8 could have lined up above the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#957;&#949;&#973;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962;</font> in v. 9 in a scribe&#8217;s exemplar, thus occasioning dittography. (It is interesting to note that in both <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>49</sup> and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> the two instances of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#966;&#969;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font> line up.) However, written in a contracted form, as a <i>nomen sacrum</i> (<font face="Greek Uncials">pMnMs</font>) &#8211; a practice found even in the earliest <sc>mss &#8211; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#957;&#949;&#973;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962;</font> would not have been easily confused with <font face="Greek Uncials">fwtos</font> (there being only the last letter to occasion homoioteleuton rather than the last three). Further, the external evidence for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#966;&#969;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font> is quite compelling (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>49</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A B D* F G P 33 81 1739 1881 2464 <i>pc </i>latt co); it is rather doubtful that the early and widespread witnesses all mistook <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#957;&#949;&#973;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962;</font> for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#966;&#969;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font>. In addition, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#957;&#949;&#973;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962;</font> can be readily explained as harking back to Gal 5:22 (&#8220;the fruit of the Spirit&#8221;). Thus, on balance, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#966;&#969;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font> appears to be original, giving rise to the reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#957;&#949;&#973;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962;</font>.</p>

<A NAME="518"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=205><b>sn</b> The following passage has been typeset as poetry because many scholars regard this passage as poetic or hymnic. These terms are used broadly to refer to the genre of writing, not to the content. There are two broad criteria for determining if a passage is poetic or hymnic: &#8220;(a) <i>stylistic:</i> a certain rhythmical lilt when the passages are read aloud, the presence of <i>parallelismus membrorum</i> (i.e., an arrangement into couplets), the semblance of some metre, and the presence of rhetorical devices such as alliteration, <i>chiasmus</i>, and antithesis; and (b) <i>linguistic: </i>an unusual vocabulary, particularly the presence of theological terms, which is different from the surrounding context&#8221; (P. T. O&#8217;Brien, <i>Philippians </i>[NIGTC], 188-89). Classifying a passage as hymnic or poetic is important because understanding this genre can provide keys to interpretation. However, not all scholars agree that the above criteria are present in this passage, so the decision to typeset it as poetry should be viewed as a tentative decision about its genre.</p>
<A NAME="519"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=206><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;Rise up.&#8221; </p>

Thus, it has been translated as &#8220;O sleeper.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="521"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=208><b>sn</b> A composite quotation, possibly from Isa 26:19, 51:17, 52:1, and 60:1.</p>
<A NAME="522"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=209><b>tn</b> &#8220;become wise by understanding&#8221;; <i>Grk</i> &#8220;understanding.&#8221; The imperative &#8220;be wise&#8221; is apparently implied by the construction of vv. 15-21. See the following text-critical note for discussion.</p>
<A NAME="523"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=210><b>tc</b> &#8225; The best witnesses read the imperative here (so <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46 </sup><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A B P 0278 33 81 1739 <i>pc</i>). The participle is found primarily in the Western and Byzantine texttypes (D<sup>2 </sup><font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 1881 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> latt [D* F G are slightly different, but support the participial reading]). But the participle is superior on internal grounds: The structure of v. 17 almost requires an imperative after <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#955;&#955;&#940;</font> (<font face="Greektl">alla</font>), for this gives balance to the clause: &#8220;Do not become foolish, <i>but</i> understand&#8230;&#8221; If the participle is original, it may be imperatival (and thus should be translated just like an imperative), but such is quite rare in the NT. More likely, there is an implied imperative as follows: &#8220;Do not become foolish, but <i>become wise</i>, understanding what the will of the Lord is.&#8221; Either way, the participle is the harder reading and ought therefore to be considered original. It is significant that seeing an implied imperative in this verse affords a certain symmetry to the author&#8217;s thought in vv. 15-21: There are three main sections (vv. 15-16, v. 17, vv. 18-21), each of which provides a negative injunction, followed by a positive injunction, followed by a present adverbial participle. If <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#965;&#957;&#943;&#949;&#964;&#949;</font> (<font face="Greektl">suniete</font>) is original, this symmetry is lost. Thus, even though the external evidence for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#965;&#957;&#953;&#941;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">sunientes</font>) is not nearly as weighty as for the imperative, both the transcriptional and intrinsic evidence support it. </p>

<A NAME="526"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=213><b>tn</b> Many have taken <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#960;&#957;&#949;&#973;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">en pneumati</font>) as indicating content, i.e., one is to be filled with the Spirit. <i>ExSyn </i>375 states, &#8220;There are no other examples in biblical Greek in which <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957;</font> + the dative after <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#955;&#951;&#961;&#972;&#969;</font> indicates content. Further, the parallel with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#7988;&#957;&#8179;</font> as well as the common grammatical category of <i>means </i>suggest that the idea intended is that believers are to be filled <i>by means of</i> the [Holy] Spirit. If so there seems to be an unnamed agent. The meaning of this text can only be fully appreciated in light of the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#955;&#951;&#961;&#972;&#969;</font> language in Ephesians. Always the term is used in connection with a member of the Trinity. Three considerations seem to be key: (1) In Eph 3:19 the &#8216;hinge&#8217; prayer introducing the last half of the letter makes a request that the believers &#8216;be filled with all the fullness of God&#8217; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#955;&#951;&#961;&#969;&#952;&#8134;&#964;&#949; &#949;&#7984;&#962; &#960;&#8118;&#957; &#960;&#955;&#8053;&#961;&#969;&#956;&#945; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font>). The explicit <i>content</i> of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#955;&#951;&#961;&#972;&#969;</font> is thus God&#8217;s fullness (probably a reference to his moral attributes). (2) In 4:10 Christ is said to be the agent of filling (with v. 11 adding the specifics of his giving spiritual gifts). (3) The author then brings his argument to a crescendo in 5:18: Believers are to be filled <i>by </i>Christ <i>by means of </i>the Spirit <i>with </i>the content of the fullness of God.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="527"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=214><b>tn</b> See BDAG 1096 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#968;&#940;&#955;&#955;&#969;</font>.</p>

<A NAME="530"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=217><b>sn</b> <i>Eph 5:19-21. </i>In Eph 5:18 the author gives the command to be filled by means of the Holy Spirit. In 5:19-21 there follows five participles: (1) speaking; (2) singing; (3) making music; (4) giving thanks; (5) submitting. These participles have been variously interpreted, but perhaps the two most likely interpretations are (1) the participles indicate the <i>means </i>by which one is filled by the Spirit; (2) the participles indicate the <i>result</i> of being filled by the Spirit. The fact that the participles are present tense and follow the command (i.e., &#8220;be filled&#8221;) would tend to support both of these options. But it seems out of Paul&#8217;s character to reduce the filling of the Spirit to a formula of some kind. To the extent that this is true, it is unlikely then that the author is here stating the <i>means</i> for being filled by the Spirit. Because it is in keeping with Pauline theology and has good grammatical support, it is better to take the participles as indicating certain results of being filled by the Spirit. See <i>ExSyn </i>639.</p>
<A NAME="531"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=218><b>tn</b> Many scholars regard Eph 5:21 as the verse which introduces this section, rather than 5:22. This is due in part to the lack of a main verb in this verse (see <b>tc</b> note which follows). This connection is not likely, however, because it requires the participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8017;&#960;&#959;&#964;&#945;&#963;&#963;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jupotassomenoi</font>, &#8220;submitting&#8221;) in 5:21 to act as the main verb of the section, and this participle more likely is linked to the command &#8220;be filled by the Spirit&#8221; in 5:18 as a participle of result (see <b>sn</b> above). In any case, 5:21 does form a strong link between 5:18-21 and what follows, so the paragraph division which has been placed between 5:21 and 22 should not be viewed as a complete break in the author&#8217;s thought.</p>
<A NAME="532"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=219><b>tc</b> The witnesses for the shorter reading (in which the verb &#8220;submit&#8221; is only implied) are minimal (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46 </sup>B Cl Hier<sup>mss</sup>), but significant and early. The rest of the witnesses add one of two verb forms as required by the sense of the passage (picking up the verb from v. 21). Several of these witnesses have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8017;&#960;&#959;&#964;&#945;&#963;&#963;&#941;&#963;&#952;&#969;&#963;&#945;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jupotassesqwsan</font>), the third person imperative (so <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A I P <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 0278 33 81 1175 1739 1881 <i>al </i>lat co), while other witnesses, especially the later Byzantine cursives, read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8017;&#960;&#959;&#964;&#940;&#963;&#963;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#949;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jupotassesqe</font>), the second person imperative (D F G <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> sy). The text virtually begs for one of these two verb forms, but the often cryptic style of Paul&#8217;s letters argues for the shorter reading. The chronology of development seems to have been <i>no verb</i> &#8211; third person imperative &#8211; second person imperative. It is not insignificant that early lectionaries began a new day&#8217;s reading with v. 22; these most likely caused copyists to add the verb at this juncture. </p>

<A NAME="539"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=226><b>tc</b> Most Western witnesses, as well as the majority of Byzantine <sc>mss and a few others (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>2</sup> D F G <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 0278 0285<sup>vid</sup> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat), add the following words to the end of the verse: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#963;&#945;&#961;&#954;&#8056;&#962; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7952;&#954; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#8000;&#963;&#964;&#941;&#969;&#957; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ek th&quot; sarko&quot; autou kai ek twn ostewn autou</font>, &#8220;of his body and of his bones&#8221;). This is a (slightly modified) quotation from Gen 2:23a (LXX). The Alexandrian text is solidly behind the shorter reading (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* A B 048 33 81 1739* 1881 <i>pc</i>). Although it is possible that an early scribe&#8217;s eye skipped over the final <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</font>, there is a much greater likelihood that a scribe added the Genesis quotation in order to fill out and make explicit the author&#8217;s incomplete reference to Gen 2:23. Further, on intrinsic grounds, it seems unlikely that the author would refer to the physical nature of creation when speaking of the &#8220;body of Christ&#8221; which is spiritual or mystical. Hence, as is often the case with OT quotations, the scribal clarification missed the point the author was making; the shorter reading stands as original.</p>

It could be an adversative idea such as &#8220;but,&#8221; &#8220;nevertheless,&#8221; or &#8220;however&#8221; (see NIV, NASB, NRSV), or it could simply be intended to round out and bring to conclusion the author&#8217;s discussion.
