<A NAME="21"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=67><b>tn</b><i> </i>The adverbial participle &#8220;being&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8004;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">ontas</font>) is taken concessively.</p>
<A NAME="22"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=68><b>sn</b> Chapter 2 starts off with a participle, <i>although you were dead</i>, that is left dangling. The syntax in Greek for vv. 1-3 constitutes one incomplete sentence, though it seems to have been done intentionally. The dangling participle leaves the readers in suspense while they wait for the solution (in v. 4) to their spiritual dilemma.</p>
<A NAME="23"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=69><b>sn</b> The relative pronoun <i>which </i>is feminine as is <i>sins</i>, indicating that <i>sins</i> is the antecedent.</p>
<A NAME="24"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=70><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;walked.&#8221; </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The Greek verb translated <i>lived </i>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#960;&#945;&#964;&#941;&#969;</font>, <font face="Greektl">peripatew</font>) in the NT letters refers to the conduct of one&#8217;s life, not to physical walking.</p>
<A NAME="25"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=71><b>tn</b> Or possibly &#8220;Aeon.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The word translated <i>present path</i> is the same as that which has been translated [this] <i>age</i> in 1:21 (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#7984;&#8061;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">aiwn</font>).</p>
<A NAME="26"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=72><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;domain, [place of] authority.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="27"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=73><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;of&#8221; (but see the note on the word &#8220;spirit&#8221; later in this verse).</p>
<A NAME="28"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=74><b>sn</b> The <i>ruler of the kingdom of the air</i> is also the ruler of <i>the spirit that is now energizing the sons of disobedience</i>. Although several translations regard the <i>ruler</i> to be the same as the <i>spirit</i>, this is unlikely since the cases in Greek are different (<i>ruler</i> is accusative and <i>spirit</i> is genitive). To get around this, some have suggested that the genitive for <i>spirit</i> is a genitive of apposition. However, the semantics of the genitive of apposition are against such an interpretation (cf. <i>ExSyn</i> 100).</p>
<A NAME="29"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=75><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;working in.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=76><b>sn</b> <i>Sons of disobedience </i>is a Semitic idiom that means &#8220;people characterized by disobedience.&#8221; However, it also contains a subtle allusion to vv. 4-10: Some of those sons of disobedience have become sons of God.</p>
<A NAME="211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=77><b>sn</b> <i>Among whom. </i>The relative pronoun phrase that begins v. 3 is identical, except for gender, to the one that begins v. 2 (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#945;&#7989;&#962;</font> [<font face="Greektl">en Jais</font>], <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#959;&#7989;&#962;</font> [<font face="Greektl">en Jois</font>]). By the structure, the author is building an argument for our hopeless condition: We lived in sin and we lived among sinful people. Our doom looked to be sealed as well in v. 2: Both the external environment (<i>kingdom of the air</i>) and our internal motivation and attitude (<i>the spirit that is now energizing</i>) were under the devil&#8217;s thumb (cf. 2 Cor 4:4).</p>
<A NAME="212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=78><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;we all.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=79><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;even.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=80><b>sn</b> <i>Children of wrath</i> is a Semitic idiom which may mean either &#8220;people characterized by wrath&#8221; or &#8220;people destined for wrath.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=81><b>sn</b> <i>Eph 2:1-3. </i>The translation of vv. 1-3 is very literal, even to the point of retaining the awkward syntax of the original. See note on the word <i>dead</i> in 2:1.</p>
<A NAME="216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=82><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;by grace you have been saved.&#8221; The perfect tense in Greek connotes both completed action (&#8220;you have been saved&#8221;) and continuing results (&#8220;you are saved&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=83><b>tn</b> Or possibly &#8220;to the Aeons who are about to come.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=84><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;upon.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=85><b>tn</b> See note on the same expression in v. 5.</p>
<A NAME="220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=86><b>tc</b> The feminine article is found before <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#969;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pistews</font>, &#8220;faith&#8221;) in the Byzantine text as well as in A <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 1881 <i>pc</i>. Perhaps for some scribes the article was intended to imply creedal fidelity as a necessary condition of salvation (&#8220;you are saved through <i>the</i> faith&#8221;), although elsewhere in the <i>corpus Paulinum</i> the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#8048; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#969;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">dia th&quot; pistew&quot;</font>) is used for the act of believing rather than the content of faith (cf. Rom 3:30, 31; Gal 3:14; Eph 3:17; Col 2:12). On the other side, strong representatives of the Alexandrian and Western texts (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B D* F G P 0278 6 33 1739 <i>al </i>bo) lack the article. Hence, both text-critically and exegetically, the meaning of the text here is most likely &#8220;saved through faith&#8221; as opposed to &#8220;saved through the faith.&#8221; Regarding the textual problem, the lack of the article is the preferred reading.</p>
<A NAME="221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=87><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;not as a result of.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=88><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;lest anyone should boast.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=89><b>tn</b><i> Grk</i> &#8220;so that we might walk in them&#8221; (or &#8220;by them&#8221;).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>So that we may do them.</i> Before the devil began to control our walk in sin and among sinful people, God had already planned good works for us to do.</p>
<A NAME="224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=90><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;in the flesh.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=91><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;without Christ.&#8221; Both &#8220;Christ&#8221; (Greek) and &#8220;Messiah&#8221; (Hebrew and Aramaic) mean &#8220;one who has been anointed.&#8221; Because the context refers to ancient Israel&#8217;s messianic expectation, &#8220;Messiah&#8221; was employed in the translation at this point rather than &#8220;Christ.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=92><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;covenants of the promise.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=93><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;have come near in the blood of Christ.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> See the note on &#8220;his blood&#8221; in 1:7.</p>
<A NAME="228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=94><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;who made the both one.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=95><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;rendered inoperative.&#8221; This is a difficult text to translate because it is not easy to find an English term which communicates well the essence of the author&#8217;s meaning, especially since legal terminology is involved. Many other translations use the term &#8220;abolish&#8221; (so NRSV, NASB, NIV), but this term implies complete destruction which is not the author&#8217;s meaning here. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#961;&#947;&#941;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">katargew</font>) can readily have the meaning &#8220;to cause someth. to lose its power or effectiveness&#8221; (BDAG 525 s.v. 2, where this passage is listed), and this meaning fits quite naturally here within the author&#8217;s legal mindset. A proper English term which communicates this well is &#8220;nullify&#8221; since this word carries the denotation of &#8220;making something legally null and void.&#8221; This is not, however, a common English word. An alternate term like &#8220;rendered inoperative [or ineffective]&#8221; is also accurate but fairly inelegant. For this reason, the translation retains the term &#8220;nullify&#8221;; it is the best choice of the available options, despite its problems.</p>
<A NAME="230"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=96><b>tn</b> In this context the author is not referring to a new individual, but instead to a new corporate entity united in Christ (cf. BDAG 497 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#953;&#957;&#972;&#962;</font> 3.b: &#8220;All the Christians together appear as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;</font>. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;</font> Eph 2:15&#8221;). This is clear from the comparison made between the Gentiles and Israel in the immediately preceding verses and the assertion in v. 14 that Christ &#8220;made both groups into one.&#8221; This is a different metaphor than the &#8220;new man&#8221; of Eph 4:24; in that passage the &#8220;new man&#8221; refers to the new life a believer has through a relationship to Christ.</p>
<A NAME="231"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=97><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;in order to create the two into one new man.&#8221; Eph 2:14-16 is one sentence in Greek. A new sentence was started here in the translation for clarity since contemporary English is less tolerant of extended sentences.</p>
<A NAME="232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=98><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;by killing the hostility in himself.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=99><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;for.&#8221; BDAG gives the consecutive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joti</font>) as a possible category of NT usage (BDAG 732 s.v. 5.c).</p>
<A NAME="234"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=100><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;having been built.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=101><b>sn</b> <i>Apostles and prophets. </i>Because the prophets appear after the mention of the apostles and because they are linked together in 3:5 as recipients of revelation about the church, they are to be regarded not as Old Testament prophets, but as New Testament prophets.</p>
<A NAME="236"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=102><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;while Christ Jesus himself is&#8221; or &#8220;Christ Jesus himself being.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="237"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=103><b>tn</b> Or perhaps &#8220;capstone&#8221; (NAB). The meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#954;&#961;&#959;&#947;&#969;&#957;&#953;&#945;&#8150;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">akrogwniaio&quot;</font>) is greatly debated. The meaning &#8220;capstone&#8221; is proposed by J. Jeremias (<i>TDNT</i> 1:792), but the most important text for this meaning (<i>T. Sol. </i>22:7-23:4) is late and possibly not even an appropriate parallel. The only place <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#954;&#961;&#959;&#947;&#969;&#957;&#953;&#945;&#8150;&#959;&#962;</font> is used in the LXX is Isa 28:16, and there it clearly refers to a cornerstone that is part of a foundation. Furthermore, the imagery in this context has the building growing off the cornerstone upward, whereas if Christ were the capstone, he would not assume his position until the building was finished, which vv. 21-22 argue against.</p>
<A NAME="238"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=104><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;in whom&#8221; (v. 21 is a relative clause, subordinate to v. 20).</p>
<A NAME="239"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=105><b>tc</b> Although several important witnesses (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>1</sup> A C P 6 81 326 1739<sup>c</sup> 1881) have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#8118;&#963;&#945; &#7969; &#959;&#7984;&#954;&#959;&#948;&#959;&#956;&#8053;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pasa Jh oikodomh</font>), instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#8118;&#963;&#945; &#959;&#7984;&#954;&#959;&#948;&#959;&#956;&#8053; </font>(the reading of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* B D F G <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 33 1739* <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>), the article is almost surely a scribal addition intended to clarify the meaning of the text, for with the article the meaning is unambiguously &#8220;the whole building.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;every building.&#8221; Although &#8220;every building&#8221; is a more natural translation of the Greek, it does not fit as naturally into the context, which (with its emphasis on corporate unity) seems to stress the idea of one building.</p>
