<A NAME="49"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=160><b>tc</b> The Western texttype (D* F G it) lacks the plural noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#941;&#961;&#951;</font> (<font face="Greektl">merh</font>, &#8220;regions&#8221;); the shorter reading cannot be dismissed out of hand since it is also supported by <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46</sup> (which often has strong affinities, however, with the Western text). The inclusion of the word has strong external support from important, early <sc>mss as well as the majority of Byzantine cursives (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A B C D<sup>2</sup> I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 33 1739 1881 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>). Certain scribes may have deleted the word, thinking it superfluous; in addition, if the shorter reading were original one would expect to see at least a little variation in clarifying additions to the text. For these reasons the inclusion of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#941;&#961;&#951;</font> should be regarded as original.</p>
