<A NAME="428"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=179><b>tn</b> An alternative rendering for the infinitives in vv. 22-24 (&#8220;to lay aside&#8230; to be renewed&#8230; to put on&#8221;) is &#8220;that you have laid aside&#8230; that you are being renewed&#8230; that you have put on.&#8221; The three infinitives of vv. 22 (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#952;&#941;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;</font>, <font face="Greektl">apoqesqai</font>), 23 (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#945;&#957;&#949;&#959;&#8166;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;</font>, <font face="Greektl">ananeousqai</font>), and 24 (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957;&#948;&#973;&#963;&#945;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;</font>, <font face="Greektl">endusasqai</font>), form part of an indirect discourse clause; they constitute the teaching given to the believers addressed in the letter. The problem in translation is that one cannot be absolutely certain whether they go back to indicatives in the original statement (i.e., &#8220;you have put off&#8221;) or imperatives (i.e., &#8220;put off!&#8221;). Every other occurrence of an aorist infinitive in indirect discourse in the NT goes back to an imperative, but in all of these examples the indirect discourse is introduced by a verb that implies a command. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#948;&#940;&#963;&#954;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">didaskw</font>) in the <i>corpus Paulinum </i>may be used to relate the indicatives of the faith as well as the imperatives. This translation implies that the infinitives go back to imperatives, though the alternate view that they refer back to indicatives is also a plausible interpretation. For further discussion, see <i>ExSyn </i>605.</p>
