<A NAME="413"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=164><b>sn</b> Some interpreters have understood the phrase <i>pastors and teachers</i> to refer to one and the same group. This would mean that all pastors are teachers and that all teachers are pastors. This position is often taken because it is recognized that both nouns (i.e., <i>pastors</i> and <i>teachers</i>) are governed by one article in Greek. But because the nouns are plural, it is extremely unlikely that they refer to the same group, but only that the author is linking them closely together. It is better to regard the pastors as a subset of teachers. In other words, all pastors are teachers, but not all teachers are pastors. See <i>ExSyn</i> 284.</p>
