<A NAME="419"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=170><b>tn</b> While the sense of the passage is clear enough, translation in English is somewhat difficult. The Greek says: &#8220;by the trickery of men, by craftiness with the scheme of deceit.&#8221; The point is that the author is concerned about Christians growing into maturity. He is fearful that certain kinds of very cunning people, who are skilled at deceitful scheming, should come in and teach false doctrines which would in turn stunt the growth of the believers.</p>
