<A NAME="410"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=161><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;to the lower parts of the earth.&#8221; This phrase has been variously interpreted: (1) The traditional view understands it as a reference to the underworld (hell), where Jesus is thought to have descended in the three days between his death and resurrection. In this case, &#8220;of the earth&#8221; would be a partitive genitive. (2) A second option is to translate the phrase &#8220;of the earth&#8221; as a genitive of apposition: &#8220;to the lower parts, namely, the earth&#8221; (as in the present translation). Many recent scholars hold this view and argue that it is a reference to the incarnation. (3) A third option, which also sees the phrase &#8220;of the earth&#8221; as a genitive of apposition, is that the descent in the passage occurs <i>after</i> the ascent rather than before it, and refers to the descent of the Spirit at Pentecost (cf. Acts 4:11-16). Support for this latter view is found in the intertestamental and rabbinic use of Ps 68:18 (quoted in v. 8), which is consistently and solely interpreted as a reference to Moses&#8217; ascent of Mt. Sinai to &#8220;capture&#8221; the words of the law. The probability, therefore, is that the comments here in v. 9 reflect a polemic against the interpretation of Ps 68:18 in certain circles as a reference to Moses. See W. H. Harris, <i>The Descent of Christ</i> (AGJU 32), 46-54; 171-204.</p>
