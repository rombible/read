<A NAME="433"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=184><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#959;&#961;&#947;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#972;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">parorgismo&quot;</font>), typically translated &#8220;anger&#8221; in most versions is used almost exclusively of the <i>source</i> of anger rather than the results in Greek literature (thus, it refers to an external cause or provocation rather than an internal reaction). The notion of &#8220;cause of your anger&#8221; is both lexically and historically justified. The apparently proverbial nature of the statement (&#8220;Do not let the sun go down on the cause of your anger&#8221;) finds several remarkable parallels in <i>Pss. Sol.</i> 8:8-9: &#8220;(8) God laid bare their sins in the full light of day; All the earth came to know the righteous judgments of God. (9) In secret places underground their iniquities (were committed) to provoke (Him) to anger&#8221; (R. H. Charles&#8217; translation). Not only is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#959;&#961;&#947;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#972;&#962;</font> used, but righteous indignation against God&#8217;s own people and the laying bare of their sins in broad daylight are also seen. </p>
