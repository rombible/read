<A NAME="539"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=226><b>tc</b> Most Western witnesses, as well as the majority of Byzantine <sc>mss and a few others (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>2</sup> D F G <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 0278 0285<sup>vid</sup> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat), add the following words to the end of the verse: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#963;&#945;&#961;&#954;&#8056;&#962; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7952;&#954; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#8000;&#963;&#964;&#941;&#969;&#957; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ek th&quot; sarko&quot; autou kai ek twn ostewn autou</font>, &#8220;of his body and of his bones&#8221;). This is a (slightly modified) quotation from Gen 2:23a (LXX). The Alexandrian text is solidly behind the shorter reading (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* A B 048 33 81 1739* 1881 <i>pc</i>). Although it is possible that an early scribe&#8217;s eye skipped over the final <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</font>, there is a much greater likelihood that a scribe added the Genesis quotation in order to fill out and make explicit the author&#8217;s incomplete reference to Gen 2:23. Further, on intrinsic grounds, it seems unlikely that the author would refer to the physical nature of creation when speaking of the &#8220;body of Christ&#8221; which is spiritual or mystical. Hence, as is often the case with OT quotations, the scribal clarification missed the point the author was making; the shorter reading stands as original.</p>
