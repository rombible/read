<A NAME="531"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=218><b>tn</b> Many scholars regard Eph 5:21 as the verse which introduces this section, rather than 5:22. This is due in part to the lack of a main verb in this verse (see <b>tc</b> note which follows). This connection is not likely, however, because it requires the participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8017;&#960;&#959;&#964;&#945;&#963;&#963;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jupotassomenoi</font>, &#8220;submitting&#8221;) in 5:21 to act as the main verb of the section, and this participle more likely is linked to the command &#8220;be filled by the Spirit&#8221; in 5:18 as a participle of result (see <b>sn</b> above). In any case, 5:21 does form a strong link between 5:18-21 and what follows, so the paragraph division which has been placed between 5:21 and 22 should not be viewed as a complete break in the author&#8217;s thought.</p>
