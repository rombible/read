<A NAME="532"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=219><b>tc</b> The witnesses for the shorter reading (in which the verb &#8220;submit&#8221; is only implied) are minimal (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46 </sup>B Cl Hier<sup>mss</sup>), but significant and early. The rest of the witnesses add one of two verb forms as required by the sense of the passage (picking up the verb from v. 21). Several of these witnesses have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8017;&#960;&#959;&#964;&#945;&#963;&#963;&#941;&#963;&#952;&#969;&#963;&#945;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jupotassesqwsan</font>), the third person imperative (so <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A I P <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 0278 33 81 1175 1739 1881 <i>al </i>lat co), while other witnesses, especially the later Byzantine cursives, read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8017;&#960;&#959;&#964;&#940;&#963;&#963;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#949;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jupotassesqe</font>), the second person imperative (D F G <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> sy). The text virtually begs for one of these two verb forms, but the often cryptic style of Paul&#8217;s letters argues for the shorter reading. The chronology of development seems to have been <i>no verb</i> &#8211; third person imperative &#8211; second person imperative. It is not insignificant that early lectionaries began a new day&#8217;s reading with v. 22; these most likely caused copyists to add the verb at this juncture. </p>
