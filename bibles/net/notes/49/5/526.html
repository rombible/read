<A NAME="526"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=213><b>tn</b> Many have taken <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#960;&#957;&#949;&#973;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">en pneumati</font>) as indicating content, i.e., one is to be filled with the Spirit. <i>ExSyn </i>375 states, &#8220;There are no other examples in biblical Greek in which <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957;</font> + the dative after <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#955;&#951;&#961;&#972;&#969;</font> indicates content. Further, the parallel with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#7988;&#957;&#8179;</font> as well as the common grammatical category of <i>means </i>suggest that the idea intended is that believers are to be filled <i>by means of</i> the [Holy] Spirit. If so there seems to be an unnamed agent. The meaning of this text can only be fully appreciated in light of the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#955;&#951;&#961;&#972;&#969;</font> language in Ephesians. Always the term is used in connection with a member of the Trinity. Three considerations seem to be key: (1) In Eph 3:19 the &#8216;hinge&#8217; prayer introducing the last half of the letter makes a request that the believers &#8216;be filled with all the fullness of God&#8217; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#955;&#951;&#961;&#969;&#952;&#8134;&#964;&#949; &#949;&#7984;&#962; &#960;&#8118;&#957; &#960;&#955;&#8053;&#961;&#969;&#956;&#945; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font>). The explicit <i>content</i> of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#955;&#951;&#961;&#972;&#969;</font> is thus God&#8217;s fullness (probably a reference to his moral attributes). (2) In 4:10 Christ is said to be the agent of filling (with v. 11 adding the specifics of his giving spiritual gifts). (3) The author then brings his argument to a crescendo in 5:18: Believers are to be filled <i>by </i>Christ <i>by means of </i>the Spirit <i>with </i>the content of the fullness of God.&#8221;</p>
