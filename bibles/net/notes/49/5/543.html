<A NAME="543"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=230><b>tn</b> The translation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#955;&#8053;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">plhn</font>) is somewhat difficult in this context, though the overall thrust of the argument is clear. It could be an adversative idea such as &#8220;but,&#8221; &#8220;nevertheless,&#8221; or &#8220;however&#8221; (see NIV, NASB, NRSV), or it could simply be intended to round out and bring to conclusion the author&#8217;s discussion. In this latter case it could be translated with the use of &#8220;now&#8221; (so A. T. Lincoln, <i>Ephesians</i> [WBC]<i>, </i>384). </p>
