<A NAME="530"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=217><b>sn</b> <i>Eph 5:19-21. </i>In Eph 5:18 the author gives the command to be filled by means of the Holy Spirit. In 5:19-21 there follows five participles: (1) speaking; (2) singing; (3) making music; (4) giving thanks; (5) submitting. These participles have been variously interpreted, but perhaps the two most likely interpretations are (1) the participles indicate the <i>means </i>by which one is filled by the Spirit; (2) the participles indicate the <i>result</i> of being filled by the Spirit. The fact that the participles are present tense and follow the command (i.e., &#8220;be filled&#8221;) would tend to support both of these options. But it seems out of Paul&#8217;s character to reduce the filling of the Spirit to a formula of some kind. To the extent that this is true, it is unlikely then that the author is here stating the <i>means</i> for being filled by the Spirit. Because it is in keeping with Pauline theology and has good grammatical support, it is better to take the participles as indicating certain results of being filled by the Spirit. See <i>ExSyn </i>639.</p>
