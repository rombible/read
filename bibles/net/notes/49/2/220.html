<A NAME="220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=86><b>tc</b> The feminine article is found before <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#969;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pistews</font>, &#8220;faith&#8221;) in the Byzantine text as well as in A <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 1881 <i>pc</i>. Perhaps for some scribes the article was intended to imply creedal fidelity as a necessary condition of salvation (&#8220;you are saved through <i>the</i> faith&#8221;), although elsewhere in the <i>corpus Paulinum</i> the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#8048; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#969;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">dia th&quot; pistew&quot;</font>) is used for the act of believing rather than the content of faith (cf. Rom 3:30, 31; Gal 3:14; Eph 3:17; Col 2:12). On the other side, strong representatives of the Alexandrian and Western texts (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B D* F G P 0278 6 33 1739 <i>al </i>bo) lack the article. Hence, both text-critically and exegetically, the meaning of the text here is most likely &#8220;saved through faith&#8221; as opposed to &#8220;saved through the faith.&#8221; Regarding the textual problem, the lack of the article is the preferred reading.</p>
