<A NAME="22"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=68><b>sn</b> Chapter 2 starts off with a participle, <i>although you were dead</i>, that is left dangling. The syntax in Greek for vv. 1-3 constitutes one incomplete sentence, though it seems to have been done intentionally. The dangling participle leaves the readers in suspense while they wait for the solution (in v. 4) to their spiritual dilemma.</p>
