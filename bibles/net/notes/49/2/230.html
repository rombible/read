<A NAME="230"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=96><b>tn</b> In this context the author is not referring to a new individual, but instead to a new corporate entity united in Christ (cf. BDAG 497 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#953;&#957;&#972;&#962;</font> 3.b: &#8220;All the Christians together appear as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;</font>. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;</font> Eph 2:15&#8221;). This is clear from the comparison made between the Gentiles and Israel in the immediately preceding verses and the assertion in v. 14 that Christ &#8220;made both groups into one.&#8221; This is a different metaphor than the &#8220;new man&#8221; of Eph 4:24; in that passage the &#8220;new man&#8221; refers to the new life a believer has through a relationship to Christ.</p>
