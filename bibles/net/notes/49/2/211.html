<A NAME="211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=77><b>sn</b> <i>Among whom. </i>The relative pronoun phrase that begins v. 3 is identical, except for gender, to the one that begins v. 2 (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#945;&#7989;&#962;</font> [<font face="Greektl">en Jais</font>], <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#959;&#7989;&#962;</font> [<font face="Greektl">en Jois</font>]). By the structure, the author is building an argument for our hopeless condition: We lived in sin and we lived among sinful people. Our doom looked to be sealed as well in v. 2: Both the external environment (<i>kingdom of the air</i>) and our internal motivation and attitude (<i>the spirit that is now energizing</i>) were under the devil&#8217;s thumb (cf. 2 Cor 4:4).</p>
