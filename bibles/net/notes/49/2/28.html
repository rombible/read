<A NAME="28"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=74><b>sn</b> The <i>ruler of the kingdom of the air</i> is also the ruler of <i>the spirit that is now energizing the sons of disobedience</i>. Although several translations regard the <i>ruler</i> to be the same as the <i>spirit</i>, this is unlikely since the cases in Greek are different (<i>ruler</i> is accusative and <i>spirit</i> is genitive). To get around this, some have suggested that the genitive for <i>spirit</i> is a genitive of apposition. However, the semantics of the genitive of apposition are against such an interpretation (cf. <i>ExSyn</i> 100).</p>
