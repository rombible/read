<A NAME="225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=91><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;without Christ.&#8221; Both &#8220;Christ&#8221; (Greek) and &#8220;Messiah&#8221; (Hebrew and Aramaic) mean &#8220;one who has been anointed.&#8221; Because the context refers to ancient Israel&#8217;s messianic expectation, &#8220;Messiah&#8221; was employed in the translation at this point rather than &#8220;Christ.&#8221;</p>
