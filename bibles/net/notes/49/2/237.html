<A NAME="237"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=103><b>tn</b> Or perhaps &#8220;capstone&#8221; (NAB). The meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#954;&#961;&#959;&#947;&#969;&#957;&#953;&#945;&#8150;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">akrogwniaio&quot;</font>) is greatly debated. The meaning &#8220;capstone&#8221; is proposed by J. Jeremias (<i>TDNT</i> 1:792), but the most important text for this meaning (<i>T. Sol. </i>22:7-23:4) is late and possibly not even an appropriate parallel. The only place <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#954;&#961;&#959;&#947;&#969;&#957;&#953;&#945;&#8150;&#959;&#962;</font> is used in the LXX is Isa 28:16, and there it clearly refers to a cornerstone that is part of a foundation. Furthermore, the imagery in this context has the building growing off the cornerstone upward, whereas if Christ were the capstone, he would not assume his position until the building was finished, which vv. 21-22 argue against.</p>
