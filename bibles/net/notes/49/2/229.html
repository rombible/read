<A NAME="229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=95><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;rendered inoperative.&#8221; This is a difficult text to translate because it is not easy to find an English term which communicates well the essence of the author&#8217;s meaning, especially since legal terminology is involved. Many other translations use the term &#8220;abolish&#8221; (so NRSV, NASB, NIV), but this term implies complete destruction which is not the author&#8217;s meaning here. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#961;&#947;&#941;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">katargew</font>) can readily have the meaning &#8220;to cause someth. to lose its power or effectiveness&#8221; (BDAG 525 s.v. 2, where this passage is listed), and this meaning fits quite naturally here within the author&#8217;s legal mindset. A proper English term which communicates this well is &#8220;nullify&#8221; since this word carries the denotation of &#8220;making something legally null and void.&#8221; This is not, however, a common English word. An alternate term like &#8220;rendered inoperative [or ineffective]&#8221; is also accurate but fairly inelegant. For this reason, the translation retains the term &#8220;nullify&#8221;; it is the best choice of the available options, despite its problems.</p>
