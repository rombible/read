<A NAME="24"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=153><b>sn</b> The verb &#8220;to store up&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1503;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tsafan</font>; cf. NAB, NLT &#8220;treasure&#8221;) in the second colon qualifies the term &#8220;receive&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1495;</font>, <font face="Scholar">laqakh</font>) in the first, just as &#8220;commands&#8221; intensifies &#8220;words.&#8221; This pattern of intensification through parallelism occurs throughout the next three verses. The verb &#8220;to store up; to treasure&#8221; is used in reference to things of value for future use, e.g., wealth, dowry for a bride. Since proverbs will be useful throughout life and not always immediately applicable, the idea of storing up the sayings is fitting. They will form the way people think which in turn will influence attitudes (W. G. Plaut, <i>Proverbs</i>, 43). </p>
