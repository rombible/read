<A NAME="263"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=212><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;strange woman&#8221; (so KJV, NASB); NRSV &#8220;the loose woman.&#8221; The root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zur</font>, &#8220;to be a stranger&#8221;) sometimes refers to people who are ethnically foreign to Israel (Isa 1:7; Hos 7:9; 8:7) but it often refers to what is morally estranged from God or his covenant people (Pss 58:4; 78:30; BDB 266 s.v.). Referring to a woman, it means adulteress or prostitute (Prov 2:16; 5:3, 20; 7:5; 22:14; 23:33; see BDB 266 s.v. 2.b). It does not mean that she is a foreigner but that she is estranged from the community with its social and religious values (W. McKane, <i>Proverbs</i> [OTL], 285). It describes her as outside the framework of the covenant community (L. A. Snijders, &#8220;The Meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font> in the Old Testament: An Exegetical Study,&#8221; <i>OTS</i> 10 [1954]: 85-86). Here an Israelite woman is in view because her marriage is called a &#8220;covenant with God.&#8221; She is an adulteress, acting outside the legal bounds of the marriage contract.</p>
