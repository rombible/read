<A NAME="213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=162><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;give your voice&#8221;; the expression is idiomatic for raising or lifting the voice to make a sound that carries further (e.g., Jer 2:15). This deliberate expression indicates that something significant is being uttered. J. H. Greenstone says, &#8220;If it [understanding] does not come at your first call, raise your voice to a higher pitch, put forth greater efforts&#8221; (<i>Proverbs</i>, 17).</p>
