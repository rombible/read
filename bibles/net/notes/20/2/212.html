<A NAME="212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=161><b>sn</b> The noun recalls the second purpose of the book (1:2). It is also cognate to the last word of 2:2, forming a transition. The two objects of the prepositions in this verse are actually personifications, as if they could be summoned.</p>
