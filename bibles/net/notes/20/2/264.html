<A NAME="264"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=213><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;alien woman.&#8221; The adjective <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1499;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nokhri</font>, &#8220;foreign; alien&#8221;) refers to (1) people who are ethnically alien to Israel (Exod 21:8; Deut 17:15; Judg 19:12; Ruth 2:10; 1 Kgs 11:1, 8; Ezra 10:2, 10, 11; see BDB 649 s.v. 1); (2) people who are morally alienated from God and his covenant people (Job 19:15; Ps 69:9; Prov 20:16; Eccl 6:2; Jer 2:21; see BDB 649 s.v. 3) and (3) as a technical term in Proverbs for a harlot or promiscuous woman as someone who is morally alienated from God and moral society (Prov 2:16; 5:20; 6:24; 7:5; 20:16; 23:27; 27:13; see BDB 649 s.v. 2). The description of the woman as a &#8220;strange woman&#8221; and now an &#8220;alien woman&#8221; is within the context of the people of Israel. She is a &#8220;foreigner&#8221; in the sense that she is a nonconformist, wayward and loose. It does not necessarily mean that she is not ethnically Israelite (though BDB notes that most harlots in Israel were originally chiefly foreigners by reason of their otherwise homeless condition). </p>
