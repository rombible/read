<A NAME="211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1804><b>sn</b> &#8220;Heart&#8221; is a metonymy of subject; it signifies the ability to make decisions, if not the decisions themselves.</p>
<A NAME="212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1805><b>sn</b> &#8220;Hand&#8221; in this passage is a personification; the word is frequently used idiomatically for &#8220;power,&#8221; and that is the sense intended here.</p>
<A NAME="213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1806><b>tn</b> &#8220;Channels of water&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1490;&#1461;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Scholar">palge</font>) is an adverbial accusative, functioning as a figure of comparison &#8211; &#8220;like channels of water.&#8221; Cf. NAB &#8220;Like a stream&#8221;; NIV &#8220;watercourse&#8221;; NRSV, NLT &#8220;a stream of water.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The farmer channels irrigation ditches where he wants them, where they will do the most good; so does the <sc>Lord with the king. No king is supreme; the <sc>Lord rules.</p>
<A NAME="214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1807><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;in his own eyes.&#8221; The term &#8220;eyes&#8221; is a metonymy for estimation, opinion, evaluation.</p>
<A NAME="215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1808><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;weighs&#8221; (so NASB, NIV, NRSV); NLT &#8220;examines&#8221;; NCV, TEV &#8220;judges.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1809><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the hearts.&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1461;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lev</font>, &#8220;heart&#8221;) is used as a metonymy of association for thoughts and motives (BDB 660-61 s.v. 6-7). Even though people think they know themselves, the <sc>Lord evaluates motives as well (e.g., Prov 16:2).</p>
<A NAME="217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1810><b>tn</b> The Niphal participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bakhar</font>, &#8220;to choose&#8221;) means &#8220;choice to the <sc>Lord&#8221; or &#8220;chosen of the <sc>Lord,&#8221; meaning &#8220;acceptable to the <sc>Lord&#8221;; cf. TEV &#8220;pleases the Lord more.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1811><b>sn</b> The <sc>Lord prefers righteousness above religious service (e.g., Prov 15:8; 21:29; 1 Sam 15:22; Ps 40:6-8; Isa 1:11-17). This is not a rejection of ritual worship; rather, religious acts are without value apart from righteous living.</p>
<A NAME="219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1812><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the tillage [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1460;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nir</font>] of the wicked is sin&#8221; (so NAB). The subject picks up the subjects of the first half of the verse, indicating they are equal &#8211; the tillage consists of the arrogance and pride. The word &#8220;tillage&#8221; is figurative, of course, signifying that the agricultural product (the point of the comparison) of the wicked is sin. The relationship between the ideas is then problematic. Are pride and arrogance what the wicked produce? Some (ASV, NASB, NIV, NRSV) have followed the LXX and <i>Tg</i>. Prov 21:4 to read &#8220;lamp&#8221; instead (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1461;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ner</font>), but that does not solve the difficulty of the relationship between the expressions. It does, however, say that the life ( = lamp), which is arrogance and pride, is sin.</p>
<A NAME="2110"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1813><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;diligent&#8221; is an adjective used substantivally. The related verb means &#8220;to cut, sharpen, decide&#8221;; so the adjective describes one who is &#8220;sharp&#8221; &#8211; one who acts decisively. The word &#8220;hasty&#8221; has the idea of being pressed or pressured into quick actions. So the text contrasts calculated expeditiousness with unproductive haste. C. H. Toy does not like this contrast, and so proposes changing the latter to &#8220;lazy&#8221; (<i>Proverbs</i> [ICC], 399), but W. McKane rightly criticizes that as unnecessarily forming a pedestrian antithesis (<i>Proverbs </i>[OTL], 550). </p>
<A NAME="2111"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1814><b>tn</b> The term &#8220;lead&#8221; is supplied in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="2112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1815><b>tn</b> The Hebrew noun translated &#8220;plenty&#8221; comes from the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yatar</font>), which means &#8220;to remain over.&#8221; So the calculated diligence will lead to abundance, prosperity. </p>
<A NAME="2113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1816><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;lack; need; thing needed&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;to want.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1817><b>tn</b> The first word of the verse is the noun meaning &#8220;doing, deed, work.&#8221; The <i>BHS </i>editors suggest reading with the LXX an active participle &#8211; &#8220;the one who makes&#8221; (cf. NAB &#8220;He who makes&#8221;). The second word means &#8220;treasure,&#8221; from the verb &#8220;lay up, store up.&#8221; It is an objective genitive here. </p>
<A NAME="2115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1818><b>tn</b> The comparative &#8220;like&#8221; does not appear in the Hebrew text, but is implied by the metaphor; it is supplied for the sake of clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2116"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1819><b>tn</b> The Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1462;&#1489;&#1462;&#1500; &#1504;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hevel nidaf</font>) is properly &#8220;a driven vapor&#8221; (&#8220;driven&#8221; = the Niphal participle). The point of the metaphor is that the ill-gotten gains will vanish into thin air. The LXX has &#8220;pursues&#8221; (as if reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1465;&#1491;&#1461;&#1507;</font>, <font face="Scholar">rodef</font>); cf. NAB &#8220;chasing a bubble over deadly snares.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1820><b>tn</b> The Hebrew has &#8220;seekers of death,&#8221; meaning &#8220;[they that seek them] are seekers of death,&#8221; or that the fortune is &#8220;a fleeting vapor for those who seek death.&#8221; The sense is not readily apparent. The Greek and the Latin versions have &#8220;snares of death&#8221;; the form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1511;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">moqÿshe</font>) was read instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1511;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿvaqshe</font>). This reading does not make a more credible metaphor, and one must explain the loss of the letter <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;</font> (<i>bet</i>) in the textual variant. It is, however, slightly easier to interpret in the verse, and is followed by a number of English versions (e.g., NAB, NIV, NRSV, NLT). But whether the easier reading is the correct one in this case would be difficult to prove.</p>
<A NAME="2118"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1821><b>tn</b> The &#8220;violence&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1491;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shod</font>) drags away the wicked, probably either to do more sin or to their punishment. &#8220;Violence&#8221; here is either personified, or it is a metonymy of cause, meaning &#8220;the outcome of their violence&#8221; drags them away.</p>
<A NAME="2119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1822><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;violence of the wicked.&#8221; This is a subjective genitive: &#8220;violence which the wicked do.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2120"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1823><b>tn</b> The second colon of the verse is the causal clause, explaining why they are dragged away. They are not passive victims of their circumstances or their crimes. They choose to persist in their violence and so it destroys them.</p>
<A NAME="2121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1824><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they refuse to do justice&#8221; (so ASV); NASB &#8220;refuse to act with justice.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1825><b>tn</b> The first line of the proverb is difficult. Since <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1464;&#1494;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vazar</font>) occurs only here it has been given much attention. The translation of &#8220;guilty&#8221; is drawn from an Arabic cognate meaning &#8220;to bear a burden&#8221; and so &#8220;to be sin laden&#8221; or &#8220;guilty&#8221; (cf. NASB, NIV, NCV, NRSV, NLT). G. R. Driver prefers to read the line as &#8220;a man crooked of ways is false [<i>zar</i>]&#8221; (&#8220;Problems in the Hebrew Text of Proverbs,&#8221; <i>Bib</i> 32 [1951]: 185). C. H. Toy adopts the meaning of &#8220;proud&#8221; (<i>Proverbs</i> [ICC], 400). Whatever the reading, &#8220;guilty&#8221; or &#8220;proud&#8221; or &#8220;false,&#8221; the idea is that such people are devious. Bad people are underhanded; good people are aboveboard (C. H. Toy, <i>Proverbs</i> [ICC], 400). Another way to analyze the line is to read it with the definition &#8220;strange, stranger&#8221;: &#8220;The way of a man and a stranger is perverse.&#8221; But this is unclear, and would form no satisfactory contrast to 8b. Another suggestion is &#8220;the way of (usual) man is changeable and strange, but the pure fellow leads a straight and even course&#8221; (J. H. Greenstone, <i>Proverbs</i>, 244); cf. NLT &#8220;the innocent travel a straight road.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1826><b>tn</b> The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1458;&#1508;&#1463;&#1499;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hafakhfakh</font>) is an adjective with an intensified meaning due to the duplication of the second and third radicals; it means &#8220;very devious; crooked&#8221; (from the verb &#8220;to overturn&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="2124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1827><b>tn</b> If this translation stands, then the construction is formed with an independent nominative absolute, resumed by the suffixed noun as the formal subject. It draws attention to the &#8220;pure&#8221; or &#8220;innocent&#8221; person in contrast to the previously mentioned wicked. </p>
<A NAME="2125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1828><b>tn</b> English versions which translate the Hebrew term as &#8220;roof&#8221; here sometimes produce amusing images for modern readers: TEV &#8220;Better to live on the roof&#8221;; CEV &#8220;It&#8217;s better to stay outside on the roof of your house.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The reference is probably to a small room that would be built on the flat housetop primarily for guests (e.g., 1 Kgs 17:19; 2 Kgs 4:10). It would be cramped and lonely &#8211; but peaceful in avoiding strife.</p>
<A NAME="2126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1829><b>tn</b> The &#8220;house of company&#8221; has received numerous interpretations. The word &#8220;company&#8221; or &#8220;companionship&#8221; would qualify &#8220;house&#8221; as a place to be shared. The <i>BHS</i> editors propose &#8220;spacious house,&#8221; which would call for a transposition of letters (cf. NAB &#8220;a roomy house&#8221;; NLT &#8220;a lovely home&#8221;). Such an emendation makes good sense, but has no external support.</p>
<A NAME="2127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1830><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a wife of contentions&#8221;; KJV &#8220;a brawling woman&#8221;; TEV, CEV &#8220;a nagging wife.&#8221; The Greek version has no reference to a quarrelsome wife, but instead mentions justice in a common house.</p>
<A NAME="2128"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1831><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;soul.&#8221; The Hebrew text uses <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nefesh</font>, traditionally, &#8220;soul&#8221;) as the formal subject of the sentence &#8211; &#8220;the soul of a wicked man desires.&#8221; This term has at its core the idea of appetites, and so its use here underscores that the cravings are deep-seated (BDB 660 s.v. 5), and the translation &#8220;appetite&#8221; reflects this.</p>
<A NAME="2129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1832><b>sn</b> The word has the meanings of &#8220;desire, crave, long for, lust after.&#8221; It usually has &#8220;soul&#8221; as its subject. The word is used in the Ten Commandments in the prohibition against coveting a neighbor&#8217;s house (Deut 5:18). </p>
<A NAME="2130"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1833><b>tn</b> The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1467;&#1495;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yukhan</font>) is a Hophal imperfect from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1504;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khanan</font>); it means &#8220;to be shown mercy&#8221; &#8211; here negated to mean &#8220;he will not be shown mercy.&#8221; The person who lives to satisfy his own craving for evil will not be interested in meeting the needs of others.</p>
<A NAME="2131"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1834><b>sn</b> The contrast here is between the simple and the wise. The simple gain wisdom when they see the scorner punished; the wise gains knowledge through instruction. The scorner does not change, but should be punished for the benefit of the simple (e.g., Prov 19:25).</p>
<A NAME="2132"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1835><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the instructing of the wise.&#8221; The construction uses the Hiphil infinitive construct <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">haskil</font>) with a preposition to form a temporal clause (= &#8220;when&#8221;). The word &#8220;wise&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1499;&#1464;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">khakham</font>) after it is the subjective genitive. The preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;</font> (<i>lamed</i>) on the form is probably dittography from the ending of the infinitive.</p>
<A NAME="2133"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1836><b>tn</b> In the book of Proverbs, the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1468;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ysadiq</font>) normally refers to a human being, and that is a possible translation here (cf. KJV, ASV, NAB), although it would have to refer to a righteous person who was a judge or a ruler with the right to destroy the wicked. Many commentators and English versions simply interpret this as a reference to God (cf. NIV, NRSV, TEV, NLT). </p>
<A NAME="2134"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1837><b>tn</b> The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">maskil</font>) is now used with the meaning &#8220;to consider; to give attention to; to ponder.&#8221; It is the careful scrutiny that is given to the household of the wicked before judgment is poured out on them.</p>
<A NAME="2135"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1838><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;house.&#8221; This term probably means &#8220;household&#8221; here &#8211; the family. One way to read the line is that the righteous judge (human or divine) takes into consideration the wicked person&#8217;s family before judging the wicked person. The other &#8211; and more plausible &#8211; interpretation is that the judge considers the household of the wicked and then on the basis of what was observed judges them. </p>
<A NAME="2136"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1839><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to evil&#8221; (i.e., catastrophe); cf. NLT &#8220;to disaster.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2137"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1840><b>sn</b> The imagery means &#8220;pay no attention to&#8221; the cry for help or &#8220;refuse to help,&#8221; so it is a metonymy of cause for the effect. </p>
<A NAME="2138"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1841><b>sn</b> &#8220;Cry&#8221; here would be a metonymy of effect for the cause, the cause being the great needs of the poor.</p>
<A NAME="2139"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1842><b>sn</b> The proverb is teaching that those who show mercy will receive mercy. It involves the principle of talionic justice &#8211; those who refuse the needs of others will themselves be refused when they need help (so Luke 16:19-31).</p>
<A NAME="2140"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1843><b>sn</b> The synonymous parallelism joins the more neutral term &#8220;gift&#8221; with the more specific &#8220;bribe.&#8221; D. Kidner notes that this underscores how hard it is to tell the difference between them, especially since they accomplish similar things (<i>Proverbs </i>[TOTC], 143).</p>
<A NAME="2141"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1844><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1508;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kafah</font>) occurs only here; it means &#8220;to subdue,&#8221; but in New Hebrew it means &#8220;to overturn; to compel.&#8221; The <i>BHS</i> editors suggest a change to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kavah</font>), &#8220;to be quenched,&#8221; based on Symmachus and <i>Tg</i>. Prov 21:14, but there is no substantial improvement in the text&#8217;s meaning with such a change.</p>
<A NAME="2142"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1845><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;a bribe in the bosom&#8221; (so NASB). This refers to a gift hidden in the folds of the garment, i.e., given secretly (cf. NIV &#8220;a bribe concealed in the cloak&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="2143"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1846><b>tn</b> The repetition of the term &#8220;subdues&#8221; in the second line is supplied in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="2144"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1847><b>tc</b> The LXX offers a moralizing translation not too closely tied to the MT: &#8220;he who withholds a gift stirs up violent wrath.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2145"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1848><b>tn</b> The Qal infinitive construct <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">asot</font>) functions as the subject of the sentence.</p>
<A NAME="2146"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1849><b>tn</b> The term &#8220;brings&#8221; is supplied in the translation; many English versions supply a simple copula (&#8220;is&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="2147"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1850><b>sn</b> The noun means &#8220;terror (NAB, NASB, NIV), destruction (KJV, ASV), ruin (cf. NCV).&#8221; Its related verb means &#8220;be shattered, dismayed.&#8221; The idea of &#8220;dismay&#8221; (NRSV) or &#8220;terror&#8221; would make the better choice to contrast with &#8220;joy&#8221; in the first line, but &#8220;ruin&#8221; is also possible. Whenever justice prevails, whether in the courts or simply in society, the people who practice iniquity may be shaken into reality by fear (cf. CEV &#8220;crooks are terrified&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="2148"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1851><b>tn</b> The text uses &#8220;man&#8221; as the subject and the active participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1506;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">to</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">eh</font>) as the predicate. The image of &#8220;wandering off the path&#8221; signifies leaving a life of knowledge, prudence, and discipline.</p>

R. N.

Several attempts have been made to alleviate the problem. The NIV interprets &#8220;treasure&#8221; as &#8220;choice food,&#8221; so that food and oil would make more sense being swallowed. C. H. Toy (<i>Proverbs </i>[ICC], 406) suggests dropping &#8220;oil&#8221; altogether based on the reading in the LXX, but the Greek is too general for any support: It has &#8220;precious treasure will rest on the mouth of the sage.&#8221; W.

This is a subjective genitive. The foundational clause states that ritual acts of worship brought by the wicked (thus a subjective genitive) are detestable to God. The &#8220;wicked&#8221; refers here to people who are not members of the covenant (no faith) and are not following after righteousness (no acceptable works).

The NIV follows the suggestion of a homonym for the Hebrew word with the meaning &#8220;will perish/be destroyed&#8221;: &#8220;will be destroyed forever.&#8221; This suggests a synonymous pair of ideas rather than a contrast. Others accept antithetical parallelism. C. H. Toy suggested an idea like &#8220;be established&#8221; to contrast with &#8220;will perish&#8221; (<i>Proverbs</i> [ICC], 411). W. McKane suggested it meant the truthful witness &#8220;will speak to the end&#8221; without being put down (<i>Proverbs </i>[OTL], 556). It is simpler to interpret the words that are here in the sense of a contrast. The idea of speaking forever/to the end would then be hyperbolic.</p>

The difficulty is that both make good sense in the passage and both have support. The contrast is between the wicked who shows a bold face (reflecting a hardened heart) and the upright who either gives thought to his ways (or solidifies his ways). The sense of the <i>Qere</i> may form a slightly better contrast, one between the outer appearance of boldness and the inner discernment of action.</p>
