<A NAME="2355"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=2027><b>tn</b> The expression is difficult, and is suspected of having been added from Song 7:10, although the parallel is not exact. The verb is the Hitpael imperfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">halakh</font>); and the prepositional phrase uses the word &#8220;upright; equity; pleasing,&#8221; from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yashar</font>). KJV has &#8220;when it moveth itself aright&#8221;; much more helpful is ASV: &#8220;when it goeth down smoothly.&#8221; Most recent English versions are similar to ASV. The phrase obviously refers to the pleasing nature of wine. </p>
