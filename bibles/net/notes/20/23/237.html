<A NAME="237"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1979><b>sn</b> Verses 1-3 form the sixth saying about being cautious before rulers (cf. Instruction of Amememope, chap. 23, 23:13-18). One should not get too familiar with rulers, for they always have ulterior motives. The Mishnah cites Gamaliel as warning that a ruler only draws someone into his court for his purpose, but in their day of trouble he will not be there to help them (<i>m. Abot</i> 2:3).</p>
