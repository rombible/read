<A NAME="2320"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1992><b>tn</b> The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">go</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font>) describes a &#8220;kinsman redeemer.&#8221; Some English versions explicitly cite &#8220;God&#8221; (e.g., NCV, CEV) or &#8220;the Lord&#8221; (e.g. TEV). </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The Hebrew term describes a &#8220;kinsman-redeemer.&#8221; That individual would be a rich or powerful relative who can protect the family; he does this by paying off the debts of a poor relative, buying up the property of a relative who sells himself into slavery, marrying the widow of a deceased relative to keep the inheritance in the family, or taking vengeance on someone who harms a relative, that vengeance often resulting in delivering (&#8220;redeeming&#8221;) the relative from bondage. If there was no human &#8220;kinsman redeemer,&#8221; then the defenseless had to rely on God to perform these actions (e.g., Gen 48:16; Exod 6:6; Job 19:25; Isa 41&#8211;63). In the prophetic literature God is presented as the Redeemer in that he takes vengeance on the enemies (the Babylonians) to deliverer his people (kin). In this proverb the <sc>Lord is probably the Protector of these people who will champion their cause and set things right.</p>
