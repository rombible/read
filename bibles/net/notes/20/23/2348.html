<A NAME="2348"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=2020><b>tn</b> The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1462;&#1514;&#1462;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khetef</font>) is defined by BDB 369 s.v. as &#8220;prey,&#8221; but this is the only occurrence of the word. The related verb BDB 368-69 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1507;</font> defines as &#8220;to seize; to snatch away&#8221; (with an Aramaic cognate meaning &#8220;to break in pieces&#8221; [<i>Pa</i>], and an Arabic word &#8220;death&#8221;). But the only occurrence of that word is in Job 9:12, where it is defined as &#8220;seizes.&#8221; So in this passage the noun could have either a passive sense (what is seized = prey), or an active sense (the one who seizes = a robber, bandit). The traditional rendering is &#8220;prey&#8221; (KJV); most modern English versions have the active sense (&#8220;robber&#8221; or similar; cf. NIV &#8220;like a bandit&#8221;). Since the prepositional phrase (the simile) is modifying the woman, the active sense works better in the translation.</p>
