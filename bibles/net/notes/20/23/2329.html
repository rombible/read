<A NAME="2329"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2001><b>tn</b> The verb in this line is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1456;&#1511;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1488;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al-yÿqanne</font>&#8217;), the Piel jussive negated. The verb means &#8220;to be jealous, to be zealous&#8221;; it describes passionate intensity for something. In English, if the object is illegitimate, it is called &#8220;envy&#8221;; if it is correct, it is called &#8220;zeal.&#8221; Here the warning is not to envy the sinners. The second colon could use the verb in the positive sense to mean &#8220;but rather let your passion burn for the fear of the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
