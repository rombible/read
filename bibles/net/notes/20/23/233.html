<A NAME="233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1975><b>sn</b> The expression &#8220;put a knife to your throat&#8221; is an idiom that means &#8220;curb your appetite&#8221; or &#8220;control yourself&#8221; (cf. TEV). The instruction was from a time when people dealt with all-powerful tyrants. To enter the presence of such a person and indulge one&#8217;s appetites would be to take a very high risk.</p>
