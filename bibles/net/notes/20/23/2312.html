<A NAME="2312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1984><b>tc</b> The line is difficult; it appears to mean that the miser is the kind of person who has calculated the cost of everything in his mind as he offers the food. The LXX has: &#8220;Eating and drinking with him is as if one should swallow a hair; do not introduce him to your company nor eat bread with him.&#8221; The Hebrew verb &#8220;to calculate&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">sha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ar</font>) with a change of vocalization and of sibilant would yield &#8220;hair&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1461;&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">se</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ar</font>) &#8211; &#8220;like a hair in the throat [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nefesh</font>], so is he.&#8221; This would picture an irritating experience. The Instruction of Amenemope uses &#8220;blocking the throat&#8221; in a similar saying (chapt. 11, 14:7 [<i>ANET</i> 423]). The suggested change is plausible and is followed by NRSV; but the rare verb &#8220;to calculate&#8221; in the MT would be easier to defend on the basis of the canons of textual criticism because it is the more difficult reading.</p>
