<A NAME="2328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2000><b>sn</b> This twelfth saying simply observes that children bring joy to their parents when they demonstrate wisdom. The quatrain is arranged in a chiastic structure (AB:B'A'): The first line (A) speaks of wisdom in the child, and it is paired with the last line (A') which speaks of the child&#8217;s saying what is right. In between these brackets are two lines (B and B') concerning joy to the parent.</p>
