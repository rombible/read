<A NAME="2345"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=2017><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;foreign woman&#8221; (so ASV). The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1499;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nokhriyyah</font>, &#8220;foreign woman&#8221;) often refers to a prostitute (e.g., Prov 2:6; 5:20; 6:24; 7:5). While not all foreign women in Israel were prostitutes, their prospects for economic survival were meager and many turned to prostitution to earn a living. Some English versions see this term referring to an adulteress as opposed to a prostitute (cf. NAB, NASB, NIV, NRSV, NLT).</p>
