<A NAME="2351"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=2023><b>sn</b> The eighteenth saying is about excessive drinking. The style changes here as the sage breaks into a vivid use of the imagination. It begins with a riddle describing the effects of drunkenness (v. 29) and gives the answer in v. 30; instructions follow in v. 31, with the consequences described in v. 32; the direct address continues in vv. 33 and 34; and the whole subject is concluded with the drunkard&#8217;s own words in v. 35 (M. E. Andrews, &#8220;Variety of Expression in Proverbs 23:29-35,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 28 [1978]: 102-3).</p>
