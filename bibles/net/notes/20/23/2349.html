<A NAME="2349"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=2021><b>tn</b> The participle means &#8220;unfaithful [men]&#8221; (masculine plural); it could also be interpreted as &#8220;unfaithfulness&#8221; in the abstract sense. M. Dahood interprets it to mean &#8220;garments&#8221; (which would have to be repointed), saying that she collects garments in pledge for her service (M. Dahood, &#8220;To Pawn One&#8217;s Cloak,&#8221; <i>Bib</i> 42 [1961]: 359-66). But that is far-fetched; it might have happened on occasion, but as a common custom it is unlikely. Besides that, the text in the MT makes perfectly good sense without such a change. </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Such a woman makes more people prove unfaithful to the law of God through her practice.</p>
