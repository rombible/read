<A NAME="2325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1997><b>tn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ol</font>, &#8220;Sheol&#8221;) in this context probably means &#8220;death&#8221; (so NIV, NCV, NLT) and not the realm of the departed (wicked) spirits (cf. NAB &#8220;the nether world&#8221;). In the wisdom of other lands, Ahiqar 6:82 says, &#8220;If I strike you, my son, you will not die.&#8221; The idea is that discipline helps the child to a full life; if the child dies prematurely, it would be more than likely a consequence of not being trained by discipline. In the book of Proverbs the &#8220;death&#8221; mentioned here could be social as well as physical.</p>
