<A NAME="2310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1982><b>sn</b> This seventh saying warns people not to expend all their energy trying to get rich because riches are fleeting (cf. Instruction of Amememope, chap. 7, 9:10-11 which says, &#8220;they have made themselves wings like geese and have flown away to heaven&#8221;). In the ancient world the symbol of birds flying away signified fleeting wealth.</p>
