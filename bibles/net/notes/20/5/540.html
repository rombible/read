<A NAME="540"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=448><b>sn</b> The positive instruction is now given: Find pleasure in a fulfilling marriage. The &#8220;fountain&#8221; is another in the series of implied comparisons with the sexual pleasure that must be fulfilled at home. That it should be blessed (the passive participle of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font>, <font face="Scholar">barakh</font>) indicates that sexual delight is God-given; having it blessed would mean that it would be endowed with fruitfulness, that it would fulfill all that God intended it to do. </p>
