<A NAME="510"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=418><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term translated &#8220;wormwood&#8221; refers to the aromatic plant that contrasts with the sweetness of honey. Some follow the LXX and translate it as &#8220;gall&#8221; (cf. NIV). The point is that there was sweetness when the tryst had alluring glamour, but afterward it had an ugly ring (W. G. Plaut, <i>Proverbs</i>, 74).</p>
