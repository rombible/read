<A NAME="511"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=419><b>sn</b> The Hebrew has &#8220;like a sword of [two] mouths,&#8221; meaning a double-edged sword that devours/cuts either way. There is no movement without damage. There may be a wordplay here with this description of the &#8220;sword with two mouths,&#8221; and the subject of the passage being the words of her mouth which also have two sides to them. The irony is cut by the idiom. </p>
