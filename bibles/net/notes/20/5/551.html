<A NAME="551"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=459><b>tn</b> The suffix on the verb is the direct object suffix; &#8220;the wicked&#8221; is a second object by apposition: They capture him, the wicked. Since &#8220;the wicked&#8221; is not found in the LXX, it could be an old scribal error; or the Greek translator may have simply smoothed out the sentence. C. H. Toy suggests turning the sentence into a passive idea: &#8220;The wicked will be caught in his iniquities&#8221; (<i>Proverbs</i> [ICC], 117).</p>
