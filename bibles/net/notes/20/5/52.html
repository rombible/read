<A NAME="52"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=410><b>tn</b> The text again has &#8220;my son.&#8221; In this passage perhaps &#8220;son&#8221; would be the most fitting because of the warning against going to the adulterous woman. However, since the image of the adulterous woman probably represents all kinds of folly (through personification), and since even in this particular folly the temptation works both ways, the general address to either young men or women should be retained. The text was certainly not intended to convey that only women could seduce men.</p>
