<A NAME="521"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=429><b>sn</b> The term <b><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;</font></b> (<font face="Scholar">hod</font>, &#8220;vigor; splendor; majesty&#8221;) in this context means the best time of one&#8217;s life (cf. NIV &#8220;your best strength&#8221;), the full manly vigor that will be wasted with licentiousness. Here it is paralleled by &#8220;years,&#8221; which refers to the best years of that vigor, the prime of life. Life would be ruined by living this way, or the revenge of the woman&#8217;s husband would cut it short. </p>
