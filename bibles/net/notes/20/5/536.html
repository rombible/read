<A NAME="536"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=444><b>sn</b> Paul Kruger develops this section as an allegory consisting of a series of metaphors. He suggests that what is at issue is private versus common property. The images of the cistern, well, or fountain are used of a wife (e.g., Song 4:15) because she, like water, satisfies desires. Streams of water in the street would then mean sexual contact with a lewd woman. According to 7:12 she never stays home but is in the streets and is the property of many (P. Kruger, &#8220;Promiscuity and Marriage Fidelity? A Note on Prov 5:15-18,&#8221;<i> JNSL</i> 13 [1987]: 61-68).</p>
