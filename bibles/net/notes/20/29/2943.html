<A NAME="2943"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=2409><b>sn</b> The expression <i>gives light to the eyes</i> means &#8220;gives them sight&#8221; (cf. NIV). The expression means that by giving them sight the <sc>Lord gives them the light of life (e.g., Job 33:30; Ps 13:3). God creates and controls them all. So in spite of their circumstances in life, all people receive their life from God.</p>
