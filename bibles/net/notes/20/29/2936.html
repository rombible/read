<A NAME="2936"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=2402><b>tn</b> The line is difficult. The MT has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1488;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512; &#1497;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1495;&#1462;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">khor yÿshabbÿkhennah</font>), which literally means &#8220;steals it back.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shavakh</font>) means &#8220;to soothe; to still,&#8221; as with a storm, or here with the temper. But because <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">akhor</font>) does not fit very well with this verb, most commentators offer some suggested change. C. H. Toy reads &#8220;anger&#8221; instead of &#8220;back&#8221; and translates the verb &#8220;restrain&#8221; following the LXX, which has &#8220;self-control&#8221; (<i>Proverbs </i>[ICC], 510). The idea of self-control is what is intended, but the changes suggested are not entirely warranted. A number of English versions have &#8220;holds it back&#8221; (e.g., NASB, NRSV, NLT), and this fits the Hebrew as well as any.</p>
