<A NAME="2946"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=2412><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;rod&#8221; is a metonymy of cause, in which the instrument being used to discipline is mentioned in place of the process of disciplining someone. So the expression refers to the process of discipline that is designed to correct someone. Some understand the words &#8220;rod and reproof&#8221; to form a hendiadys, meaning &#8220;a correcting [or, reproving] rod&#8221; (cf. NAB, NIV &#8220;the rod of correction&#8221;).</p>
