<A NAME="2952"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=2418><b>sn</b> The Hebrew verb translated &#8220;see&#8221; in this context indicates a triumph: The righteous will gaze with satisfaction, or they will look on the downfall of the wicked triumphantly (e.g., Pss 37:4 and 112:8). The verse is teaching that no matter how widespread evil may be, the righteous will someday see its destruction.</p>
