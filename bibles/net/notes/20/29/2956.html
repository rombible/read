<A NAME="2956"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=2422><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;no vision.&#8221; The Hebrew word &#8220;vision&#8221; (from the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1494;&#1464;&#1492;</font> [<font face="Scholar">khazah</font>, &#8220;to see&#8221;]) refers to divine communication to prophets (as in 1 Sam 3:1) and not to individual goals or plans. C. H. Toy sees a problem here: The most calamitous period of Israel&#8217;s history was when prophetic vision was at its height, whereas people were often more obedient when God was silent. He also notes that in the book of Proverbs there is no mention of prophetic teaching with wisdom as a guide. So he emends the word to &#8220;guidance&#8221; following the LXX (<i>Proverbs </i>[ICC], 512). The TEV has &#8220;guidance&#8221;; the NIV retains &#8220;revelation.&#8221; It must be stated that the prophetic ministry was usually in response to the calamitous periods, calling the people back to God. Without them the downward rush to anarchy and destruction would have been faster than with these prophetic calls from God.</p>
