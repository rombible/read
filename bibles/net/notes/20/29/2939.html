<A NAME="2939"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=2405><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sharat</font>) means &#8220;to minister; to serve.&#8221; The Piel plural participle here refers to servants of the king who attend to him &#8211; courtiers and ministers (cf. NIV, NRSV, TEV, CEV &#8220;officials&#8221;; NLT &#8220;advisers&#8221;). This, his entourage, will have to resort to evil practices to gain his favor if he is swayed by such lies.</p>
