<A NAME="2923"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2389><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word used here is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">din</font>), which typically means &#8220;judgment,&#8221; but can also mean &#8220;strife&#8221; and &#8220;cause.&#8221; Here it refers to the &#8220;cause&#8221; of the poor (so KJV, ASV), their plea, their case, their legal rights. A righteous person is sympathetic to this.</p>
