<A NAME="2951"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=2417><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ravah</font>), which is repeated twice in this line, means &#8220;to increase.&#8221; The first occurrence here is usually taken to mean that when the wicked increase they hold the power (cf. NRSV, NLT &#8220;are in authority&#8221;; TEV, CEV &#8220;are in power&#8221;). The text does not explain the details, only that when the wicked increase sin will increase in the land.</p>
