<A NAME="2934"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=2400><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and the upright seek his life.&#8221; There are two ways this second line can be taken. (1) One can see it as a continuation of the first line, meaning that the bloodthirsty men also &#8220;seek the life of the upright&#8221; (cf. NIV, NRSV). The difficulty is that the suffix is singular but the apparent referent is plural. (2) One can take it is as a contrast: &#8220;but as for the upright, they seek his life&#8221; &#8211; a fairly straightforward rendering (cf. ASV). The difficulty here is that &#8220;seeking a life&#8221; is normally a hostile act, but it would here be positive: &#8220;seeking&#8221; a life to preserve it. The verse would then say that the bloodthirsty hate the innocent, but the righteous protect them (W. McKane, <i>Proverbs </i>[OTL], 637; cf. NAB, NASB, TEV).</p>
