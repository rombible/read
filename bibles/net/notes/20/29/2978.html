<A NAME="2978"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">78</span><note=2444><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the fear of man.&#8221; This uses an objective genitive to describe a situation where fearing what people might do or think controls one&#8217;s life. There is no indication in the immediate context that this should be limited only to males, so the translation uses the more generic &#8220;people&#8221; here.</p>
