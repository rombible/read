<A NAME="2959"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=2425><b>tn</b> There is a tendency among commentators and English versions to translate <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ashrehu</font>) as &#8220;happy is he!&#8221; (cf. KJV, ASV, NAB, NASB, TEV, NLT). But &#8220;happy&#8221; can be a misleading translation. The Hebrew word refers to a heavenly bliss, an inner joy, that comes from knowing one is right with God and experiencing his blessing. &#8220;Happiness,&#8221; on the other hand, depends on what happens.</p>
