<A NAME="2918"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2384><b>tn</b> There is some ambiguity concerning the referent of &#8220;his steps.&#8221; The net could be spread for the one flattered (cf. NRSV, &#8220;a net for the neighbor&#8217;s feet&#8221;; NLT, &#8220;their feet,&#8221; referring to others), or for the flatterer himself (cf. TEV &#8220;you set a trap for yourself&#8221;). The latter idea would make the verse more powerful: In flattering someone the flatterer is getting himself into a trap (e.g., 2:16; 7:5; 26:28; 28:23).</p>
