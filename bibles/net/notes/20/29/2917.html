<A NAME="2917"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2383><b>sn</b> The image of &#8220;spreading a net&#8221; for someone&#8217;s steps is an implied comparison (a figure of speech known as hypocatastasis): As one would literally spread a net, this individual&#8217;s flattery will come back to destroy him. A net would be spread to catch the prey, and so the idea is one of being caught and destroyed.</p>
