<A NAME="2929"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2395><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1496;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shafat</font>) means &#8220;to judge.&#8221; In the Niphal stem it could be passive, but is more frequently reciprocal: &#8220;to enter into controversy&#8221; or &#8220;to go to court.&#8221; The word is usually used in connection with a lawsuit (so many recent English versions), but can also refer to an argument (e.g., 1 Sam 12:7; Isa 43:26); cf. NAB &#8220;disputes&#8221;; NASB &#8220;has a controversy.&#8221;</p>
