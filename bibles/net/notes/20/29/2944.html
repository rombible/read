<A NAME="2944"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=2410><b>tn</b> The king must judge &#8220;in truth&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1488;&#1457;&#1502;&#1462;&#1514;</font>, <font face="Scholar">be</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">emet</font>). Some have interpreted this to mean &#8220;faithfully&#8221; (KJV, ASV) but that is somewhat unclear. The idea is that the poor must be treated fairly and justly (cf. NIV &#8220;with fairness&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;with equity&#8221;); &#8220;truth&#8221; is that which corresponds to the standard of the law revealed by God. There must be no miscarriage of justice for these people simply because they are poor.</p>
