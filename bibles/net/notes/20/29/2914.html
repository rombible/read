<A NAME="2914"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2380><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ish tÿrumot</font>, &#8220;a man of offerings&#8221;), which could refer to a man who &#8220;receives gifts&#8221; or &#8220;gives gifts.&#8221; Because of its destructive nature on the country, here the phrase must mean that he receives or &#8220;exacts&#8221; the money (cf. NRSV &#8220;makes heavy exactions&#8221;). This seems to go beyond the ordinary taxation for two reasons: (1) this ruler is a &#8220;man of offerings,&#8221; indicating that it is in his nature to do this, and (2) it tears down the country. The word &#8220;offerings&#8221; has been taken to refer to gifts or bribes (cf. NASB, NIV, CEV, NLT), but the word itself suggests more the idea of tribute or taxes that are demanded; this Hebrew word was used in Leviticus for offerings given to the priests, and in Ezek 45:16 for taxes. The point seems to be that this ruler or administrator is breaking the backs of the people with heavy taxes or tribute (e.g., 1 Sam 8:11-18), and this causes division and strife.</p>
