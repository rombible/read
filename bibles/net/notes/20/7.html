<BODY ><p>
<A NAME="71"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=554><b>sn</b> The chapter begins with the important teaching of the father (1-5), then it focuses on the seduction: first of the victim (6-9), then the temptress (10-12), then the seduction (13-20), and the capitulation (21-23); the chapter concludes with the deadly results of consorting (24-27).</p>
<A NAME="72"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=555><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my son.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="73"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=556><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;within you&#8221; (so NASB, NIV); KJV, ASV, NRSV &#8220;with you.&#8221; BDB 860 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1503;</font> Qal.1 suggests that &#8220;within you&#8221; means &#8220;in your own keeping.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="74"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=557><b>tc</b> Before v. 2 the LXX inserts: &#8220;My son, fear the <sc>Lord and you will be strong, and besides him, fear no other.&#8221; Although this addition has the precedent of 3:7 and 9 and harmonizes with 14:26, it does not fit here; the advice is to listen to the teacher.</p>
<A NAME="75"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=558><b>tn</b> The construction of an imperative with the <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) of sequence after another imperative denotes a logical sequence of purpose or result: &#8220;that you may live,&#8221; or &#8220;and you will live.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="76"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=559><b>tn</b> The term &#8220;obey&#8221; does not appear in the Hebrew text, but is implied by the parallelism; it is supplied for the sake of clarity and smoothness. Some English versions, in light of the second line of v. 1, supply &#8220;guard&#8221; (e.g., NIV, NCV, NLT).</p>
<A NAME="77"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=560><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the little man in your eye.&#8221; Traditionally this Hebrew idiom is translated into English as &#8220;the apple of your eye&#8221; (so KJV, NAB, NIV, NRSV); a more contemporary rendering would be &#8220;as your most prized possession.&#8221; The word for &#8220;man&#8221; has the diminutive ending on it. It refers to the pupil, where the object focused on &#8211; a man &#8211; is reflected in miniature. The point is that the teaching must be the central focus of the disciple&#8217;s vision and attention.</p>
<A NAME="78"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=561><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fingers&#8221; (so KJV and many other English versions). In light of Deut 6:8, &#8220;fingers&#8221; appears to be a metonymy for the lower part of the arm.</p>
<A NAME="79"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=562><b>sn</b> This is an allusion to Deut 6:8. Binding the teachings on the fingers and writing them on the tablets here are implied comparisons for preserving the teaching in memory so that it can be recalled and used with ease.</p>
<A NAME="710"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=563><b>sn</b> The metaphor is meant to signify that the disciple will be closely related to and familiar with wisdom and understanding, as close as to a sibling. Wisdom will be personified in the next two chapters, and so referring to it as a sister in this chapter certainly prepares for that personification.</p>
<A NAME="711"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=564><b>tn</b> The infinitive construct with the preposition shows the purpose of associating closely with wisdom: Wisdom will obviate temptations, the greatest being the sexual urge. </p>
<A NAME="712"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=565><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;strange&#8221; (so KJV, ASV).</p>
<A NAME="713"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=566><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;strange woman.&#8221; This can be interpreted as a &#8220;wayward wife&#8221; (so NIV) or an &#8220;unfaithful wife&#8221; (so NCV). As discussed earlier, the designations &#8220;strange woman&#8221; and &#8220;foreign woman&#8221; could refer to Israelites who stood outside the community in their lawlessness and loose morals &#8211; an adulteress or wayward woman. H. Ringgren and W. Zimmerli, however, suggest that she is also a promoter of a pagan cult, but that is not entirely convincing (<i>Spruche/Prediger</i> [ATD], 19).</p>
<A NAME="714"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=567><b>tn</b> The term &#8220;you&#8221; does not appear in the Hebrew text, but is supplied in the translation for the sake of smoothness.</p>
<A NAME="715"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=568><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;she makes smooth her words.&#8221; This expression means &#8220;she flatters with her words.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="716"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=569><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;sons.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="717"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=570><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;lad&#8221; or &#8220;youth.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="718"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=571><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;heart.&#8221; </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This <i>young man who lacked wisdom</i> is one of the simpletons, lacking keen judgment, one void of common sense (cf. NAB, NASB, NRSV, NLT) or understanding (cf. KJV, ASV). He is young, inexperienced, featherbrained (so D. Kidner, <i>Proverbs </i>[TOTC], 75).</p>
<A NAME="719"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=572><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsa</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ad</font>) means &#8220;to step; to march.&#8221; It suggests that the youth was intentionally making his way to her house. The verb is the imperfect tense; it stresses continual action parallel to the active participle that began the verse, but within a context that is past time.</p>
<A NAME="720"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=573><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;way of her house.&#8221; This expression uses an adverbial accusative of location, telling where he was marching along. The term &#8220;house&#8221; is the genitive of location, giving the goal.</p>
<A NAME="721"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=574><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;in the evening of the day.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="722"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=575><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the middle of the night, and dark&#8221;; KJV &#8220;in the black and dark night&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;at the time of night and darkness.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="723"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=576><b>tn</b> The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿhinneh</font>) introduces a dramatic sense of the immediate to the narrative; it has a deictic force, &#8220;and look! &#8211; there was a woman,&#8221; or &#8220;all of a sudden this woman&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="724"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=577><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;with the garment of a prostitute.&#8221; The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shith</font>, &#8220;garment&#8221;) is an adverbial accusative specifying the appearance of the woman. The words &#8220;she was&#8221; are supplied in the translation to make a complete English sentence.</p>
<A NAME="725"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=578><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;kept secret of heart&#8221;; cf. ASV, NRSV &#8220;wily of heart.&#8221; The verbal form is the passive participle from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">natsar</font>) in construct. C. H. Toy lists the suggestions of the commentators: false, malicious, secret, subtle, excited, hypocritical (<i>Proverbs</i> [ICC], 149). The LXX has &#8220;causes the hearts of the young men to fly away.&#8221; The verb means &#8220;to guard; to watch; to keep&#8221;; to be guarded of heart means to be wily, to have secret intent &#8211; she has locked up her plans and gives nothing away (e.g., Isaiah 48:6 as well). Interestingly enough, this contrasts with her attire which gives everything away. </p>
<A NAME="726"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=579><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;her feet.&#8221; This is a synecdoche, a part for the whole; the point is that <i>she</i> never stays home, but is out and about all the time.</p>
<A NAME="727"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=580><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;dwell&#8221; or &#8220;settle&#8221;; NAB &#8220;her feet cannot rest.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="728"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=581><b>tn</b> The repetition of the noun &#8220;time, step,&#8221; usually translated &#8220;now, this time,&#8221; signifies here &#8220;at one time&#8230;at another time&#8221; (BDB 822 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1501;</font> 3.e).</p>
<A NAME="729"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=582><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;she makes bold her face.&#8221; The Hiphil perfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1494;&#1463;&#1494;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">azar</font>, &#8220;to be strong&#8221;) means she has an impudent face (cf. KJV, NAB, NRSV), a bold or brazen expression (cf. NASB, NIV, NLT).</p>
<A NAME="730"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=583><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;with me.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="731"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=584><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I have peace offerings.&#8221; The peace offerings refer to the meat left over from the votive offering made at the sanctuary (e.g., Lev 7:11-21). Apparently the sacrificial worship meant as little to this woman spiritually as does Christmas to modern hypocrites who follow in her pattern. By expressing that she has peace offerings, she could be saying nothing more than that she has fresh meat for a meal at home, or that she was ceremonially clean, perhaps after her period. At any rate, it is all probably a ruse for winning a customer.</p>
<A NAME="732"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=585><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to look diligently for your face.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="733"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=586><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;with spreads.&#8221; The sentence begins with the cognate accusative: &#8220;with spreads I have spread my bed.&#8221; The construction enhances the idea &#8211; she has covered her bed.</p>
<A NAME="734"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=587><b>tn</b> The feminine noun means &#8220;dark-hued stuffs&#8221; (BDB 310 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1458;&#1496;&#1467;&#1489;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font>). The form is a passive participle from a supposed root II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1496;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khatav</font>), which in Arabic means to be of a turbid, dusky color mixed with yellowish red. Its Aramaic cognate means &#8220;variegated&#8221;; cf. NAB &#8220;with brocaded cloths of Egyptian linen.&#8221; BDB&#8217;s translation of this colon is unsatifactory: &#8220;with dark hued stuffs of yarn from Egypt.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="735"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=588><b>tn</b> The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1493;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nirveh</font>) is the plural cohortative; following the imperative &#8220;come&#8221; the form expresses the hortatory &#8220;let&#8217;s.&#8221; The verb means &#8220;to be saturated; to drink one&#8217;s fill,&#8221; and can at times mean &#8220;to be intoxicated with.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="736"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=589><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;loves.&#8221; The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">dod</font>) means physical love or lovemaking. It is found frequently in the Song of Solomon for the loved one, the beloved. Here the form (literally, &#8220;loves&#8221;) is used in reference to multiple acts of sexual intercourse, as the phrase &#8220;until morning&#8221; suggests.</p>
<A NAME="737"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=590><b>tn</b> The form is the Hitpael cohortative of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1505;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alas</font>), which means &#8220;to rejoice.&#8221; Cf. NIV &#8220;let&#8217;s enjoy ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="738"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=591><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;with love.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="739"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=592><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the man.&#8221; The LXX interpreted it as &#8220;my husband,&#8221; taking the article to be used as a possessive. Many English versions do the same.</p>
<A NAME="740"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=593><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in his house.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="741"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=594><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in his hand.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="742"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=595><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he will come back at.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="743"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=596><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;new moon.&#8221; Judging from the fact that the husband took a purse of money and was staying away until the next full moon, the woman implies that they would be safe in their escapade. If v. 9 and v. 20 are any clue, he could be gone for about two weeks &#8211; until the moon is full again.</p>
<A NAME="744"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=597><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;she turned him aside.&#8221; This expression means that she persuaded him. This section now begins the description of the capitulation, for the flattering speech is finished.</p>
<A NAME="745"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=598><b>sn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1462;&#1511;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">leqakh</font>) was used earlier in Proverbs for wise instruction; now it is used ironically for enticement to sin (see D. W. Thomas, &#8220;Textual and Philological Notes on Some Passages in the Book of Proverbs,&#8221; VTSup<i> </i>3 [1955]: 280-92).<i> </i></p>
<A NAME="746"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=599><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;smooth of her lips&#8221;; cf. NAB &#8220;smooth lips&#8221;; NASB &#8220;flattering lips.&#8221; The term &#8220;lips&#8221; is a metonymy of cause representing what she says.</p>
<A NAME="747"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=600><b>tn</b> The verb means &#8220;to impel; to thrust; to banish,&#8221; but in this stem in this context &#8220;to compel; to force&#8221; into some action. The imperfect tense has the nuance of progressive imperfect to parallel the characteristic perfect of the first colon.</p>
<A NAME="748"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=601><b>tn</b> The participle with &#8220;suddenly&#8221; gives a more vivid picture, almost as if to say &#8220;there he goes.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="749"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=602><b>tn</b> The present translation follows R. B. Y. Scott (<i>Proverbs, Ecclesiastes </i>[AB], 64). This third colon of the verse would usually be rendered, &#8220;fetters to the chastening of a fool&#8221; (KJV, ASV, and NASB are all similar). But there is no support that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1462;&#1499;&#1462;&#1505;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ekhes</font>) means &#8220;fetters.&#8221; It appears in Isaiah 3:16 as &#8220;anklets.&#8221; The parallelism here suggests that some animal imagery is required. Thus the ancient versions have &#8220;as a dog to the bonds.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="750"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=603><b>sn</b> The figure of an <i>arrow</i> piercing the liver (an implied comparison) may refer to the pangs of a guilty conscience that the guilty must reap along with the spiritual and physical ruin that follows (see on these expressions H. W. Wolff, <i>Anthropology of the Old Testament).</i> </p>
<A NAME="751"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=604><b>tn</b> The expression that it is &#8220;for/about/over his life&#8221; means that it could cost him his life (e.g., Num 16:38). Alternatively, the line could refer to moral corruption and social disgrace rather than physical death &#8211; but this would not rule out physical death too. </p>
<A NAME="752"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=605><b>tn</b> The literal translation &#8220;sons&#8221; works well here in view of the warning. Cf. KJV, NAB, NRSV &#8220;children.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="753"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=606><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the words of my mouth.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="754"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=607><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;she has caused to fall.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="755"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=608><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;numerous&#8221; (so NAB, NASB, NRSV, NLT) or &#8220;countless.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="756"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=609><b>tn</b> The noun &#8220;Sheol&#8221; in parallelism to &#8220;the chambers of death&#8221; probably means the grave. The noun is a genitive of location, indicating the goal of the road(s). Her house is not the grave; it is, however, the sure way to it. </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Her house is the way to the grave. </i>The young man&#8217;s life is not destroyed in one instant; it is taken from him gradually as he enters into a course of life that will leave him as another victim of the wages of sin. The point of the warning is to prevent such a course from starting. Sin can certainly be forgiven, but the more involvement in this matter the greater the alienation from the healthy community.</p>
<A NAME="757"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=610><b>tn</b> The Qal active participle modifies &#8220;ways&#8221; to Sheol. The &#8220;road,&#8221; as it were, descends to the place of death.</p>
<A NAME="758"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=611><b>tn</b> &#8220;Chambers&#8221; is a hypocatastasis, comparing the place of death or the grave with a bedroom in the house. It plays on the subtlety of the temptation. Cf. NLT &#8220;Her bedroom is the den of death.&#8221;</p>
