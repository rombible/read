<A NAME="2555"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=2150><b>tn</b> The Niphal participle is from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1505;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rafas</font>), which means &#8220;to stamp; to tread; to foul by treading [or, by stamping].&#8221; BDB 952 s.v. defines it here as a &#8220;fountain befouled.&#8221; The picture is one of a spring of water where men and beasts gather and muddy it by their trampling in and out of it.</p>
