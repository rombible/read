<A NAME="255"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2100><b>sn</b> The proverb is affirming a simple fact: The king&#8217;s plans and decisions are beyond the comprehension of the common people. While the king would make many things clear to the people, there are other things that are &#8220;above their heads&#8221; or &#8220;too deep for them.&#8221; They are unsearchable because of his superior wisdom, his caprice, or his need for secrecy. Inscrutability is sometimes necessary to keep a firm grip on power. </p>
