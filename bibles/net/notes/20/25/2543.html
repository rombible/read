<A NAME="2543"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=2138><b>tc</b> The consonants of the Hebrew text of this verse are similar to the consonants in v. 19. The LXX has a much longer reading: &#8220;Like vinegar is bad for a wound, so a pain that afflicts the body afflicts the heart. Like a moth in a garment, and a worm in wood, so the pain of a man wounds the heart&#8221; (NRSV follows much of the LXX reading; NAB follows only the second sentence of the LXX reading). The idea that v. 20 is a dittogram is not very convincing; and the Greek version is too far removed to be of help in the matter.</p>
