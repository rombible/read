<A NAME="2557"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=2152><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1496;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mat</font>) means &#8220;to give way; to move.&#8221; This probably refers to the integrity of the righteous being lost &#8211; comparing it to moving [off course]. T. T. Perowne writes, &#8220;To see a righteous man moved from his steadfastness through fear or favour in the presence of the wicked is as disheartening as to find the stream turbid and defiled at which you were longing to quench your thirst&#8221; (<i>Proverbs</i>, 161). But the line may refer to the loss of social standing and position by the righteous due to the plots of the wicked &#8211; just as someone muddied the water, someone made the righteous slip from his place.</p>
