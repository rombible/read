<A NAME="2560"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=2155><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;whose spirit lacks restraint&#8221; (ASV similar). A person whose spirit (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ruakh</font>) &#8220;lacks restraint&#8221; is one who is given to outbursts of passion, who lacks self-control (cf. NIV, NRSV, CEV, NLT). This person has no natural defenses but reveals his true nature all the time. The proverb is stating that without self-control a person is vulnerable, like a city without defenses.</p>
