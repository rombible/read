<A NAME="2530"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2125><b>tn</b> The &#8220;tongue&#8221; is a metonymy of cause; and so the expression here refers to soft or gentle speech. This fits well with the parallel idea of patience (&#8220;long of anger&#8221;) &#8211; through a calm patient persuasion much can be accomplished. Some English versions relate this figure directly to the persuasion of a ruler in the previous line (cf. TEV &#8220;can even convince rulers&#8221;).</p>
