<A NAME="2546"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=2141><b>sn</b> The imagery of the &#8220;burning coals&#8221; represents pangs of conscience, more readily effected by kindness than by violence. These coals produce the sharp pain of contrition through regret (e.g., 18:19; 20:22; 24:17; Gen 42-45; 1 Sam 24:18-20; Rom 12:20). The coals then would be an implied comparison with a searing conscience. </p>
