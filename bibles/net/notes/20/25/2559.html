<A NAME="2559"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=2154><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the investigation of their glory is not glory.&#8221; This line is difficult to understand but it forms an analogy to honey &#8211; glory, like honey, is good, but not to excess. The LXX rendered this, &#8220;it is proper to honor notable sayings.&#8221; A. A. MacIntosh suggests, &#8220;He who searches for glory will be distressed&#8221; (&#8220;A Note on Prov 25:27,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 20 [1970]: 112-14). G. E. Bryce has &#8220;to search out difficult things is glorious&#8221; (&#8220;Another Wisdom &#8216;Book&#8217; in Proverbs,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 91 (1972): 145-47). R. C. Van Leeuwen suggests, &#8220;to seek difficult things is as glory&#8221; (&#8220;Proverbs 25:27 Once Again,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 36 [1986]: 105-14). The Hebrew is cryptic, but not unintelligible: &#8220;seeking their glory [is not] glory.&#8221; It is saying that seeking one&#8217;s own glory is dishonorable.</p>
