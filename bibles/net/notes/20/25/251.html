<A NAME="251"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2096><b>sn</b> This section of the book of Proverbs contains proverbs attributed to Solomon but copied by Hezekiah&#8217;s sages (between 715 <sc>b.c. and 687 <sc>b.c.). Some scholars conclude that this has no historical value other than to report the later disposition that people thought they came from Solomon&#8217;s time, but if that were the only consideration, then that in itself would have to be considered as a piece of historical information. But if the reference is an earlier note in the collection, then it becomes more valuable for consideration. The proverbs in these lines differ from the earlier ones in that these are multiple line sayings using more similes; chapters 28-29 are similar to 10-16, but chapters 25-27 differ in having few references to God.</p>
