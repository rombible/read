<A NAME="2523"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2118><b>sn</b> The emblem in the parallelism of this verse is the simile of the first line. Because snow at the time of harvest would be rare, and probably unwelcome, various commentators have sought to explain this expression. R. N. Whybray suggests it may refer to snow brought down from the mountains and kept cool in an ice hole (<i>Proverbs </i>[CBC], 148); this seems rather forced. J. H. Greenstone following Rashi, a Jewish scholar who lived <sc>a.d. 1040-1105, suggests it might refer to the refreshing breeze that comes from snow-capped mountains (<i>Proverbs</i>, 260). C. H. Toy suggests a snow-cooled drink (<i>Proverbs</i> [ICC], 464), and W. McKane an application of ice water to the forehead (<i>Proverbs</i> [OTL], 585). Some English versions replace &#8220;snow&#8221; with &#8220;water&#8221; (cf. TEV &#8220;cold water&#8221;; CEV &#8220;cool water&#8221;). These all attempt to explain the simile; but the point is clear enough, a faithful servant is refreshing to his master. The analogy could be hypothetical &#8211; as refreshing as the coolness of snow <i>would be</i> in harvest time.</p>
