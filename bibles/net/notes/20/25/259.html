<A NAME="259"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2104><b>sn</b> When the king purges the wicked from his court he will be left with righteous counselors and his government therefore will be &#8220;established in righteousness&#8221; &#8211; it will endure through righteousness (cf. NLT &#8220;made secure by justice&#8221;). But as J. H. Greenstone says, &#8220;The king may have perfect ideals and his conduct may be irreproachable, but he may be misled by unscrupulous courtiers&#8221; (<i>Proverbs</i>, 264).</p>
