<A NAME="2548"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=2143><b>sn</b> One difficulty here is that it is the west wind that brings rain to Israel (e.g., 1 Kgs 18:41-44). C. H. Toy suggests that the expression is general, referring to a northwest wind &#8211; unless it is an error (<i>Proverbs </i>[ICC], 468). J. P. M. van der Ploeg suggests that the saying originated outside the land, perhaps in Egypt (&#8220;Prov 25:23,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 3 [1953]: 189-92). But this would imply it was current in a place where it made no sense. R. N. Whybray suggests that the solution lies with the verb &#8220;brings forth&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1461;&#1500;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tÿkholel</font>); he suggests redefining it to mean &#8220;repels, holds back&#8221; (cf. KJV &#8220;driveth away&#8221;). Thus, the point would be that the north wind holds back the rain just as an angry look holds back slander (<i>Proverbs </i>[CBC], 149). But the support for this definition is not convincing. Seeing this as a general reference to northerly winds is the preferred solution.</p>
