<A NAME="2520"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2115><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;on its wheels.&#8221; This expression means &#8220;aptly, fittingly.&#8221; The point is obviously about the immense value and memorable beauty of words used skillfully (R. N. Whybray, <i>Proverbs </i>[CBC], 148). Noting the meaning of the term and the dual form of the word, W. McKane suggests that the expression is metaphorical for the balancing halves of a Hebrew parallel wisdom saying: &#8220;The <i>stichos</i> is a wheel, and the sentence consisting of two wheels is a &#8216;well-turned&#8217; expression&#8221; (<i>Proverbs </i>[OTL], 584). The line then would be describing a balanced, well-turned saying, a proverb; it is skillfully constructed, beautifully written, and of lasting value.</p>
