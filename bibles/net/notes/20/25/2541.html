<A NAME="2541"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=2136><b>tn</b> Since there is no preposition to clarify the construction, there are two ways to take the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1496;&#1464;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mivtakh</font>, &#8220;confidence&#8221;) in the context. It can either refer (1) to reliance on an unfaithful person, or it can refer (2) to that on which the unfaithful person relies. C. H. Toy argues for the second, that what the faithless person relies on will fail him in the time of trouble (<i>Proverbs</i> [ICC], 466). This view requires a slight change in the MT to make &#8220;confidence&#8221; a construct noun (i.e., the confidence of the faithless); the first view, which fits better the MT as it stands, says that &#8220;confidence [in] a faithless person&#8221; is like relying on a decaying tooth or a lame foot. This is the view preferred in most English versions, including the present one.</p>
