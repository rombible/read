<A NAME="2610"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2165><b>sn</b> Sending a messenger on a mission is like having another pair of feet. But if the messenger is a fool, this proverb says, not only does the sender not have an extra pair of feet &#8211; he cuts off the pair he has. It would not be simply that the message did not get through; it would get through incorrectly and be a setback! The other simile uses &#8220;violence,&#8221; a term for violent social wrongs and injustice. The metaphorical idea of &#8220;drinking&#8221; violence means suffering violence &#8211; it is one&#8217;s portion. So sending a fool on a mission will have injurious consequences.</p>
