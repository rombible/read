<A NAME="2619"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2174><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;who wounds everyone&#8221; (so NASB). A similar rendering is given by ASV, NAB, NIV, NRSV, and NLT; it is the only one that makes sense out of a verse that most commentators consider hopelessly corrupt. That is not to say it is the correct rendering, only that it makes sense as a required negative statement in a proverb. The first line has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1463;&#1489; &#1502;&#1456;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1461;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rav mÿkholel-col</font>). The first word, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rav</font>), can mean &#8220;archer,&#8221; &#8220; master,&#8221; or &#8220;much.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1461;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿkholel</font>) can mean &#8220;to wound&#8221; or &#8220;to bring forth.&#8221; The possibilities are: &#8220;a master performs [or, produces] all,&#8221; &#8220;a master injures all,&#8221; &#8220;an archer wounds all,&#8221; or &#8220;much produces all.&#8221; The line probably should be stating something negative, so the idea of an archer injuring or wounding people [at random] is preferable. An undisciplined hireling will have the same effect as an archer shooting at anything and everything (cf. NLT &#8220;an archer who shoots recklessly&#8221;).</p>
