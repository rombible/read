<A NAME="2629"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2184><b>sn</b> The sluggard is too lazy to get out of bed &#8211; although he would probably rationalize this by saying that he is not at his best in the morning. The humor of the verse is based on an analogy with a door &#8211; it moves back and forth on its hinges but goes nowhere. Like the door to the wall, the sluggard is &#8220;hinged&#8221; to his bed (e.g., Prov 6:9-10; 24:33).</p>
