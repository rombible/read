<A NAME="263"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2158><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;causeless curse&#8221; (KJV similar) describes an undeserved curse (cf. NIV, NRSV). The Hebrew word translated &#8220;causeless&#8221; is the adverb from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1464;&#1495;&#1504;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khanan</font>); it means &#8220;without cause; gratuitous.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This proverb is saying that a curse that is uttered will be powerless if that curse is undeserved. It was commonly believed in the ancient world that blessings and curses had power in themselves, that once spoken they were effectual. But scripture makes it clear that the power of a blessing or a curse depends on the power of the one behind it (e.g., Num 22:38; 23:8). A curse would only take effect if the one who declared it had the authority to do so, and he would only do that if the curse was deserved.</p>
