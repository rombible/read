<A NAME="2649"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=2204><b>tn</b> The Niphal imperfect from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nakhar</font>) means &#8220;to act [or, treat] as a foreigner [or, stranger]; to misconstrue; to disguise.&#8221; The direct object (&#8220;it&#8221;) is not present in the Hebrew text but is implied. In this passage it means that the hater speaks what is &#8220;foreign&#8221; to his thought; in other words, he dissembles.</p>
