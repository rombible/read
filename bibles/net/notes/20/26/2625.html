<A NAME="2625"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2180><b>sn</b> Previous passages in the book of Proverbs all but deny the possibility of hope for the fool. So this proverb is saying there is absolutely no hope for the self-conceited person, and there might be a slight hope for the fool &#8211; he may yet figure out that he really is a fool.</p>
