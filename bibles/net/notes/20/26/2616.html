<A NAME="2616"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2171><b>tn</b> The translation &#8220;like tying a stone in a sling&#8221; seems to make the most sense, even though the word for &#8220;sling&#8221; occurs only here. </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The point is that only someone who does not know how a sling works would do such a stupid thing (R. N. Whybray, <i>Proverbs </i>[CBC], 152). So to honor a fool would be absurd; it would be counterproductive, for he would still be a fool.</p>
