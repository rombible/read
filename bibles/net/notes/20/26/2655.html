<A NAME="2655"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=2210><b>sn</b> The number &#8220;seven&#8221; is used in scripture as the complete number. In this passage it is not intended to be literally seven; rather, the expression means that there is complete or total abomination in his heart. Cf. TEV &#8220;his heart is filled to the brim with hate.&#8221;</p>
