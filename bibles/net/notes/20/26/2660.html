<A NAME="2660"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=2215><b>sn</b> The verse is teaching talionic justice (&#8220;an eye for an eye,&#8221; etc.), and so the activities described should be interpreted as evil in their intent. &#8220;Digging a pit&#8221; would mean laying a trap for someone (the figure of speech would be a metonymy of cause for the effect of ruining someone, if an actual pit is being dug; the figure would be hypocatastasis if digging a pit is being compared to laying a trap, but no pit is being dug). Likewise, &#8220;rolling a stone&#8221; on someone means to destroy that individual.</p>
