<A NAME="264"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2159><b>tc</b> The MT has the negative with the verb &#8220;to enter; to come&#8221; to mean &#8220;will not come&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488; &#1514;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1488;</font>, <font face="Scholar">lo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> tavo</font>&#8217;). This is interpreted to mean &#8220;will not come to rest&#8221; or &#8220;will not come home.&#8221; Some commentators have taken the <i>Qere</i> reading of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lo</font>) instead, and read it as &#8220;will come home to him.&#8221; This is also a little difficult; but it gives the idea that an undeserved curse will come [back] to him [who gave it]. Just as a bird will fly around and eventually come home, so will the undeserved curse return on the one who gave it. This is plausible; but there is no referent for the suffix, making it syntactically difficult.</p>
