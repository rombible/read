<A NAME="2646"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=2201><b>tn</b> The traditional translation of &#8220;silver dross&#8221; (so KJV, ASV, NASB) never did make much sense because the parallel idea deals with hypocrisy &#8211; &#8220;fervent lips with an evil heart.&#8221; But silver dross would not be used over earthenware &#8211; instead it is discarded. Yet the MT clearly has &#8220;silver dross&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1462;&#1505;&#1462;&#1507; &#1505;&#1460;&#1497;&#1490;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">kesef sigim</font>). Ugaritic turned up a word <i>spsg</i> which means &#8220;glaze,&#8221; and this found a parallel in Hittite <i>zapzaga[y]a.</i> H. L. Ginsberg repointed the Hebrew text to <i>k&#8217;sapsagim</i>, &#8220;like glaze,&#8221; and this has been adopted by many commentators and recent English versions (e.g., NAB, NIV, NRSV, NLT). The final <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1501;</font> (<i>mem</i>) is then classified as enclitic. See, among others, K. L. Barker, &#8220;The Value of Ugaritic for Old Testament Studies,&#8221; <i>BSac</i> 133 (1976): 128-29.</p>
