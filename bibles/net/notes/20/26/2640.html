<A NAME="2640"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=2195><b>sn</b> The subject of this proverb is not simply a deceiver, but one who does so out of jest, or at least who claims he was joking afterward. The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1513;&#1474;&#1463;&#1495;&#1461;&#1511;</font> has the idea of &#8220;laughing, mocking&#8221;; in this context it might convey the idea of &#8220;kidding&#8221; or &#8220;joking.&#8221; The point is that such practical joking is immature and often dangerous. To the foolish deceiver it might all seem like fun, like sport; but it can destroy people. One cannot trifle with dangerous weapons, or put them in irresponsible hands; likewise one cannot trifle with human relationships. W. G. Plaut notes, &#8220;The only worthwhile humor is that which laughs with, not at others&#8221; (<i>Proverbs</i>, 270).</p>
