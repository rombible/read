<A NAME="301"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2451><b>sn</b> This chapter has a title (30:1), Agur&#8217;s confession and petition (30:2-9), and a series of Agur&#8217;s admonitions (30:10-33).</p>
<A NAME="302"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2452><b>tn</b> The title <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hammasa</font>&#8217;) means &#8220;the burden,&#8221; a frequently used title in prophetic oracles. It may be that the word is a place name, although it is more likely that it describes what follows as an important revelation.</p>
<A NAME="303"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2453><b>tn</b> The definite article is used here as a demonstrative, clarifying the reference to Agur.</p>
<A NAME="304"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2454><b>sn</b> The word translated &#8220;says&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1456;&#1488;&#1467;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">um</font>) is a verbal noun; it is also a term that describes an oracle. It is usually followed by the subjective genitive: &#8220;the oracle of this man to Ithiel.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="305"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2455><b>tn</b> There have been numerous attempts to reinterpret the first two verses of the chapter. The Greek version translated the names &#8220;Ithiel&#8221; and &#8220;Ukal,&#8221; resulting in &#8220;I am weary, O God, I am weary and faint&#8221; (C. C. Torrey, &#8220;Proverbs Chapter 30,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 73 [1954]: 93-96). The LXX&#8217;s approach is followed by some English versions (e.g., NRSV, NLT). The Midrash tried through a clever etymologizing translation to attribute the works to Solomon (explained by W. G. Plaut, <i>Proverbs</i>, 299). It is most likely that someone other than Solomon wrote these sayings; they have a different, almost non-proverbial, tone to them. See P. Franklyn, &#8220;The Sayings of Agur in Proverbs 30: Piety or Skepticism,&#8221; <i>ZAW</i> 95 (1983): 239-52.</p>
<A NAME="306"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2456><b>tn</b> The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) functions in an asseverative sense, &#8220;surely; indeed; truly&#8221; (R. J. Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, 73, §449).</p>
<A NAME="307"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2457><b>tn</b> The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ba</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ar</font>) means &#8220;brutishness&#8221;; here it functions as a predicate adjective. It is followed by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">me</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ish</font>) expressing comparative degree: &#8220;more than a man&#8221; or &#8220;more than any man,&#8221; with &#8220;man&#8221; used in a generic sense. He is saying that he has fallen beneath the level of mankind. Cf. NRSV &#8220;I am too stupid to be human.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="308"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2458><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;than man.&#8221; The verse is using hyperbole; this individual feels as if he has no intelligence at all, that he is more brutish than any other human. Of course this is not true, or he would not be able to speculate on the God of the universe at all.</p>
<A NAME="309"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2459><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the understanding of a man,&#8221; with &#8220;man&#8221; used attributively here.</p>
<A NAME="3010"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2460><b>sn</b> The construction uses repetition to make the point emphatically: &#8220;I do not know the knowledge of the Holy One.&#8221; Agur&#8217;s claim to being &#8220;brutish&#8221; is here clarified &#8211; he is not one of those who has knowledge or understanding of God. C. H. Toy thinks the speaker is being sarcastic in reference to others who may have claimed such knowledge (<i>Proverbs </i>[ICC], 521).</p>
<A NAME="3011"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2461><b>tn</b> The epithet &#8220;the Holy One&#8221; is the adjective &#8220;holy&#8221; put in the masculine plural (as in 9:10). This will harmonize with the plural of majesty used to explain the plural with titles for God. However, NRSV takes the plural as a reference to the &#8220;holy ones,&#8221; presumably referring to angelic beings.</p>
<A NAME="3012"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2462><b>sn</b> To make his point Agur includes five questions. These, like Job 38&#8211;41, or Proverbs 8:24-29, focus on the divine acts to show that it is absurd for a mere mortal to think that he can explain God&#8217;s work or compare himself to God. These questions display mankind&#8217;s limitations and God&#8217;s incomparable nature. The first question could be open to include humans, but may refer to God alone (as the other questions do).</p>
<A NAME="3013"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2463><b>sn</b> The questions are filled with anthropomorphic language. The questioner is asking what humans have ever done this, but the meaning is that only God has done this. &#8220;Gathering the wind in his fists&#8221; is a way of expressing absolute sovereign control over the forces of nature.</p>
<A NAME="3014"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2464><b>sn</b> The question is comparing the clouds of the heavens to garments (e.g., Job 26:8). T. T. Perowne writes, &#8220;Men bind up water in skins or bottles; God binds up the rain-floods in the thin, gauzy texture of the changing clouds, which yet by his power does not rend under its burden of waters.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3015"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2465><b>sn</b> The <i>ends of the earth</i> is an expression often used in scripture as a metonymy of subject referring to the people who live in the ends of the earth, the far off and remote lands and islands. While that is possible here as well, this may simply be a synecdoche saying that God created the whole world, even the most remote and distant places.</p>
<A NAME="3016"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2466><b>sn</b> The reference to &#8220;son&#8221; in this passage has prompted many suggestions down through the years: It was identified as Israel in the Jewish Midrashim, the Logos or demiurge by some of the philosophers and allegorical writers, as simple poetic parallelism without a separate identity by some critical scholars, and as Jesus by Christian commentators. Parallels with Ugaritic are interesting, because Baal is referred to as a son; but that is bound up within the pantheon where there was a father god. Some of the Jewish commentators exhibit a strange logic in expressing what Christians would say is only their blindness to the full revelation: There is little cogency in this being a reference to Jesus because if there had been such a person at any time in the past he would have left some tradition about it through his descendants (J. H. Greenstone, <i>Proverbs</i>, 317). But Judaism has taught from the earliest times that Messiah was preexistent (especially in view of Micah 5 and Daniel 7); and the claims of Jesus in the Gospels bear this out. It seems best to say that there is a hint here of the nature of the Messiah as Son, a hint that will later be revealed in full through the incarnation.</p>
<A NAME="3017"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2467><b>sn</b> The text here uses an implied comparison (a figure of speech known as hypocatastasis): It compares the perfection of every word from God with some precious metal that has been refined and purified (e.g., Ps 12:6). The point is that God&#8217;s word is trustworthy; it has no defects and flaws, nothing false or misleading. The second half of the verse explains the significance of this point &#8211; it is safe to trust the <sc>Lord.</p>
<A NAME="3018"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2468><b>tn</b> The comparative &#8220;like&#8221; does not appear in the Hebrew text, but is implied by the metaphor; it is supplied in the translation for the sake of clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3019"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2469><b>sn</b> The line uses two more figures of speech to declare that God can be trusted for security and salvation. &#8220;Shield&#8221; is a simple metaphor &#8211; God protects. &#8220;Take refuge&#8221; is another implied comparison (hypocatastasis) &#8211; God provides spiritual rest and security for those who put their trust in him.</p>
<A NAME="3020"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2470><b>tn</b> The form of the verb is a Niphal perfect tense with a <i>vav</i> consecutive from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1494;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kazav</font>, &#8220;to lie&#8221;). In this stem it has the ideas of &#8220;been made deceptive,&#8221; or &#8220;shown to be false&#8221; or &#8220;proved to be a liar.&#8221; One who adds to or changes the word of the <sc>Lord will be seen as a liar.</p>
<A NAME="3021"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2471><b>sn</b> Wisdom literature often groups things in twos and fours, or in other numerical arrangements (e.g., Amos 1:3&#8211;2:6; Job 5:19; Prov 6:16-19).</p>
<A NAME="3022"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2472><b>tn</b> Assuming that the contents of vv. 7-9 are a prayer, several English versions have supplied a vocative phrase: &#8220;O <sc>Lord&#8221; (NIV); &#8220;O God&#8221; (NLT); others have supplied a similar phrase without the vocative &#8220;O&#8221;: NCV, CEV &#8220;Lord&#8221;; TEV &#8220;God.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3023"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2473><b>tn</b> The two words might form a hendiadys: &#8220;falsehood and lies&#8221; being equivalent to &#8220;complete deception.&#8221; The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;</font> means &#8220;false; empty; vain; to a false purpose.&#8221; The second word means &#8220;word of lying,&#8221; thus &#8220;a lying word.&#8221; Taken separately they might refer to false intentions and false words.</p>
<A NAME="3024"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2474><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1465;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khoq</font>) means &#8220;statute&#8221;; it is also used of a definite assignment in labor (Exod 5:14; Prov 31:15), or of a set portion of food (Gen 47:22). Here it refers to food that is the proper proportion for the speaker.</p>
<A NAME="3025"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2475><b>sn</b> Agur requested an honest life (not deceitful) and a balanced life (not self-sufficient). The second request about his provision is clarified in v. 9.</p>
<A NAME="3026"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2476><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kakhash</font>) means &#8220;to be disappointing; to deceive; to fail; to grow lean.&#8221; In the Piel stem it means &#8220;to deceive; to act deceptively; to cringe; to disappoint.&#8221; The idea of acting deceptively is illustrated in Hos 9:2 where it has the connotation of &#8220;disowning&#8221; or &#8220;refusing to acknowledge&#8221; (a meaning very close to its meaning here).</p>
<A NAME="3027"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2477><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb literally means &#8220;to take hold of; to seize&#8221;; this produces the idea of doing violence to the reputation of God.</p>
<A NAME="3028"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2478><b>tn</b> The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">talshen</font>) is the Hiphil jussive (with the negative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>); it is a denominative verb from the noun &#8220;tongue&#8221; <i>(Heb</i> &#8220;wag the tongue&#8221;). It means &#8220;to defame; to slander,&#8221; if the accusation is untrue. Some have suggested that the word might have the force of &#8220;denouncing&#8221; a slave to his master, accusing him before authorities (e.g., Deut 23:15-16). This proverb would then be a warning against meddling in the affairs of someone else.</p>
<A NAME="3029"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2479><b>tn</b> If what was said were true, then there would be no culpability. But the implication here is that it was slander. And the effect of that will be a curse &#8211; the person who is the target of the slander will &#8220;curse&#8221; the person who slandered him (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1500;</font> [<font face="Scholar">qalal</font>] in the Piel means &#8220;to treat lightly [or, with contempt]; to curse&#8221;), and culpability will result (the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;</font> means &#8220;to be guilty; to make a guilt offering [or, reparation offering]&#8221;). This word for guilt suggests a connection to the Levitical teaching that the guilty had to make reparation for damages done (Lev 5). Cf. NAB &#8220;you will have to pay the penalty&#8221;; NIV, NLT &#8220;you will pay for it.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3030"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2480><b>sn</b> The next four verses all start with the Hebrew expression translated &#8220;There is a generation.&#8221; This is a series of denunciations of things that are dangerous in society without mentioning specific punishments or proscriptions. The word &#8220;generation&#8221; as used in this passage refers to a class or group of people.</p>
<A NAME="3031"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2481><b>sn</b> The first observation is that there is a segment in society that lacks respect for parents. This uses the antonyms &#8220;curse&#8221; and [not] &#8220;bless&#8221; to make the point. To &#8220;curse&#8221; a parent could include treating them lightly, defaming them, or showing disrespect in general. To &#8220;bless&#8221; would mean to honor, respect, or enrich in some way, which is what should be done (e.g., Exod 21:17; Prov 20:20).</p>
<A NAME="3032"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2482><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rakhats</font>) means &#8220;to wash; to wash off; to wash away; to bathe.&#8221; It is used of physical washing, ceremonial washings, and hence figuratively of removing sin and guilt through confession (e.g., Isa 1:16). Here the form is the Pual perfect (unless it is a rare old Qal<i> </i>passive, since there is no Piel and no apparent change of meaning from the Qal). </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The point of the verse is that there are people who observe outer ritual and think they are pure (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1464;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</font> [<font face="Scholar">tahor</font>] is the Levitical standard for entrance into the sanctuary), but who pay no attention to inner cleansing (e.g., Matt 23:27).</p>
<A NAME="3033"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=2483><b>sn</b> <i>Filthiness</i> often refers to physical uncleanness, but here it refers to moral defilement. Zech 3:3-4 uses it metaphorically as well for the sin of the nation (e.g., Isa 36:12).</p>
<A NAME="3034"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=2484><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;how high are its eyes!&#8221; This is a use of the interrogative pronoun in exclamatory sentences (R. J. Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, 25, §127).</p>
<A NAME="3035"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=2485><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;its eyelids are lifted up,&#8221; a gesture indicating arrogance and contempt or disdain for others. To make this clear, the present translation supplies the adverb &#8220;disdainfully&#8221; at the end of the verse.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The verbs &#8220;to be high&#8221; (translated &#8220;are&#8230;lofty&#8221;) and &#8220;to be lifted up&#8221; depict arrogance and disdain for others. The emphasis on the eyes and eyelids (parasynonyms in poetry) is employed because the glance, the look, is the immediate evidence of contempt for others (e.g., also 6:17 and Ps 131:1).</p>
<A NAME="3036"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=2486><b>tn</b> The comparative &#8220;like&#8221; does not appear in the Hebrew text, but is implied by the metaphor; it is supplied in the translation for the sake of clarity.</p>
<A NAME="3037"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=2487><b>sn</b> There are two figures used in each of these lines: teeth/great teeth and &#8220;swords/knives.&#8221; The term &#8220;teeth&#8221; is a metonymy for the process of chewing and eating. This goes with the figure of the second half of the verse that speaks about &#8220;devouring&#8221; the poor &#8211; so the whole image of eating and chewing refers to destroying the poor (an implied comparison). The figures of &#8220;swords/knives&#8221; are metaphors within this image. Comparing teeth to swords means that they are sharp and powerful. The imagery captures the rapacity of their power.</p>
<A NAME="3038"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=2488><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;teeth&#8221; (so NRSV) or &#8220;jaw teeth&#8221; (so KJV, ASV, NASB) or perhaps &#8220;jawbone.&#8221; This is a different Hebrew word for &#8220;teeth&#8221; than the one in the previous line; if it refers to &#8220;jaw teeth&#8221; then a translation like &#8220;molars&#8221; would be appropriate, although this image might not fit with the metaphor (&#8220;like knives&#8221;) unless the other teeth, the incisors or front teeth, are pictured as being even longer (&#8220;like swords&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="3039"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=2489><b>tn</b> The Hebrew form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1462;&#1488;&#1457;&#1499;&#1465;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">le</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ekhol</font>) is the Qal<i> </i>infinitive construct; it indicates the purpose of this generation&#8217;s ruthless power &#8211; it is destructive. The figure is an implied comparison (known as hypocatastasis) between &#8220;devouring&#8221; and &#8220;destroying.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3040"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=2490><b>sn</b> The next two verses describe insatiable things, things that are problematic to normal life. The meaning of v. 15a and its relationship to 15b is debated. But the &#8220;leech&#8221; seems to have been selected to begin the section because it was symbolic of greed &#8211; it sucks blood through its two suckers. This may be what the reference to two daughters calling &#8220;Give! Give!&#8221; might signify (if so, this is an implied comparison, a figure known as hypocatastasis).</p>
<A NAME="3041"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=2491><b>sn</b> As one might expect, there have been various attempts to identify the &#8220;two daughters.&#8221; In the Rabbinic literature some identified <i>Alukah</i> (the &#8220;leech&#8221;) with <i>Sheol</i>, and the two daughters with paradise and hell, one claiming the righteous and the other the unrighteous; others identified <i>Alukah</i> with Gehenna, and the two daughters with heresy and government, neither of which is ever satisfied (<i>Midrash Tehillim</i> quoted by Rashi, a Jewish scholar who lived <sc>a.d. 1040-1105, and in the Talmud, <i>b. Avodah Zarah </i>17a). J. J. Glueck suggests that what is in view is erotic passion (and not a leech) with its two maidens of burning desire crying for more (&#8220;Proverbs 30:15a,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 14 [1964]: 367-70). F. S. North rightly criticizes this view as gratuitous; he argues for the view of a leech with two suckers (&#8220;The Four Insatiables,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 15 [1965]: 281-82).</p>
<A NAME="3042"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=2492><b>tn</b> The two imperatives <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1489; &#1492;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hav hav</font>, &#8220;give, give,&#8221; from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;&#1463;&#1489;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yahav</font>) correspond to the two daughters, and form their appeal. This would then be a personification &#8211; it is as if the leech is crying out, &#8220;Give! Give!&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="3043"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=2493><b>sn</b> There is a noticeable rhetorical sequence here: <i>two</i> daughters, <i>three</i> things, <i>four</i> (see W. M. Roth, &#8220;The Numerical Sequence <i>x / x +1</i> in the Old Testament,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 12 [1962]: 300-311, and &#8220;Numerical Sayings in the Old Testament,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 13 [1965]: 86). W. McKane thinks the series builds to a climax with the four, and in the four the barren woman is the focal point, the other three being metaphors for her sexual desire (<i>Proverbs </i>[OTL], 656). This interpretation is a minority view, however, and has not won widespread support.</p>
<A NAME="3044"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=2494><b>tn</b> Throughout the book of Proverbs <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hon</font>) means &#8220;wealth&#8221;; but here it has the nuance of &#8220;sufficiency&#8221; (cf. TEV, CEV, NLT &#8220;satisfied&#8221;) or &#8220;enough&#8221; (BDB 223 s.v.).</p>
<A NAME="3045"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=2495><b>tn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">she</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ol</font>, &#8220;Sheol&#8221;) refers here to the realm of the dead: &#8220;the grave&#8221; (so KJV, NIV, NLT); cf. TEV, CEV &#8220;the world of the dead&#8221;; NAB &#8220;the nether world.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3046"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=2496><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the closing of the womb,&#8221; a situation especially troubling for one who is consumed with a desire for children (e.g., Gen 16:2; 30:1).</p>

<A NAME="3052"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=2502><b>sn</b> It is difficult to know for certain what these four things had in common for the sage. They are all linked by the word &#8220;way&#8221; (meaning &#8220;a course of action&#8221;) and by a sense of mystery in each area. Suggestions for the connections between the four include: (1) all four things are hidden from continued observation, for they are in majestic form and then gone; (2) they all have a mysterious means of propulsion or motivation; (3) they all describe the movement of one thing within the sphere or domain of another; or (4) the first three serve as illustrations of the fourth and greatest wonder, which concerns human relationships and is slightly different than the first three.</p>
<A NAME="3053"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=2503><b>tn</b> This last item in the series is the most difficult to understand.

The last term does not in and of itself mean &#8220;virgin&#8221; but rather describes a young woman who is sexually ready for marriage. What is probably in view here is the wonder of human sexuality, for the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;</font> (<i>bet</i>) in this sequence indicates that the &#8220;way of the man&#8221; is &#8220;with&#8221; the woman. This mystery might begin with the manner of obtaining the love of the young woman, but focuses on the most intimate part of human relationships. And all of this was amazing to the sage. All of it is part of God&#8217;s creative plan and therefore can be enjoyed and appreciated without fully comprehending it.</p>
<A NAME="3054"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=2504><b>sn</b> Equally amazing is the insensitivity of the adulterous woman to the sin. The use of the word &#8220;way&#8221; clearly connects this and the preceding material. Its presence here also supports the interpretation of the final clause in v. 19 as referring to sexual intimacy. While that is a wonder of God&#8217;s creation, so is the way that human nature has distorted it and ruined it. </p>
<A NAME="3055"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=2505><b>sn</b> The word clearly indicates that the woman is married and unchaste; but the text describes her as amoral as much as immoral &#8211; she sees nothing wrong with what she does.</p>

<A NAME="3057"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=2507><b>sn</b> This is the amazing part of the observation.

<A NAME="3058"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=2508><b>sn</b> The Hebrew verb means &#8220;to rage; to quake; to be in tumult.&#8221; The sage is using humorous and satirical hyperbole to say that the changes described in the following verses shake up the whole order of life. The sayings assume that the new, elevated status of the individuals was not accompanied by a change in nature. For example, it was not completely unknown in the ancient world for a servant to become king, and in the process begin to behave like a king. </p>

The text does not say why she is hated; some have speculated that she might be odious (cf. KJV, ASV, NAB) or unattractive, but perhaps she is married to someone incapable of showing love (e.g., Gen 29:31, 33; Deut 21:15; Isa 60:5). Perhaps the strange situation of Jacob was in the mind of the sage, for Leah was described as &#8220;hated&#8221; (Gen 29:31).</p>

See S. P. Toperoff, &#8220;The Ant in the Bible and Midrash,&#8221; <i>Dor le Dor</i> 13 (1985): 179-83. According to this, being prepared ahead of time is a mark of true wisdom.</p>

Scholars today generally agree that the Hebrew term used here refers to a type of hyrax, a small ungulate mammal of the family <i>Procaviidae</i> native to Africa and the Middle East which has a thick body, short legs and ears and a rudimentary tail. The simple &#8220;badger&#8221; (so NASB, NRSV, CEV) could lead to confusion with the badger, an entirely unrelated species of burrowing mammal related to weasels.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Modern scholars identify this creature with the rock badger (the Syrian hyrax), a small mammal that lives in the crevices of the rock. Its wisdom consists in its ingenuity to find a place of security.</p>
<A NAME="3067"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=2517><b>sn</b> The Hebrew term means &#8220;divided&#8221;; they go forward in orderly divisions, or ranks (C. H.

Therefore the wisdom of the locust is in their order and cooperation.</p>
<A NAME="3068"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">68</span><note=2518><b>tn</b> The KJV, agreeing with <i>Tg</i>.

<A NAME="3069"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">69</span><note=2519><b>tn</b> Although the Hebrew noun translated &#8220;king&#8221; is singular here, it is traditionally translated as plural: &#8220;kings&#8217; palaces&#8221; (so KJV, NASB, NIV, NRSV).</p>

It has the idea of &#8220;doing good [in] their step.&#8221; They move about well, i.e., magnificently. The genitive would be a genitive of specification.</p>
<A NAME="3071"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=2521><b>tn</b> The construction uses the Hiphil participle again (as in the previous line) followed by the infinitive construct of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">halakh</font>).

Some have interpreted this to be the &#8220;greyhound&#8221; because it is narrow in the flanks (J. H. Greenstone, <i>Proverbs</i>, 327); so KJV, ASV. Others have suggested the warhorse, zebra, raven, or starling. <i>Tg</i>. Prov 30:31 has it as the large fighting cock that struts around among the hens. There is no clear referent that is convincing, although most modern English versions use &#8220;strutting rooster&#8221; or something similar (cf. CEV &#8220;proud roosters&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="3074"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">74</span><note=2524><b>tc</b> This last line has inspired many suggestions.

This has been emended to read &#8220;against whom there is no rising up&#8221; (so KJV, ASV) or &#8220;standing over his people.&#8221; The LXX has &#8220;a king haranguing his people.&#8221; <i>Tg</i>. Prov 30:31 has, &#8220;a king who stands up before his people and addresses them.&#8221; Some have attempted to identify this with Alcimus, the high priest who aspired to kingship (1 Macc 7:5-22), but such a suggestion is quite remote. Another interpretation sees the word for &#8220;God&#8221; in the line: &#8220;a king with whom God is.&#8221; Furthermore, C. H. Toy thinks the text is corrupt and must have at one time referred to some majestic animal (<i>Proverbs</i> [ICC], 537). While all these suggestions are fascinating, they have not improved or corrected the Hebrew text. At least one can say the focus is on the stately appearance of the king at some auspicious moment. The word occurs only here; but if it is interpreted with its Arabic cognate in mind, then it refers to a band of soldiers (BDB 39 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;</font>).</p>

<A NAME="3077"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">77</span><note=2527><b>tn</b> This line provides the explanation for the instruction to keep silent in the previous verse.

This noun occurs only here.

<A NAME="3078"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">78</span><note=2528><b>sn</b> There is a subtle wordplay here with the word for anger: It is related to the word for nose in the preceding colon.</p>
<A NAME="3079"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">79</span><note=2529><b>sn</b> The analogy indicates that continuously pressing certain things will yield results, some good, some bad.
