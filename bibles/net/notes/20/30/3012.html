<A NAME="3012"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2462><b>sn</b> To make his point Agur includes five questions. These, like Job 38&#8211;41, or Proverbs 8:24-29, focus on the divine acts to show that it is absurd for a mere mortal to think that he can explain God&#8217;s work or compare himself to God. These questions display mankind&#8217;s limitations and God&#8217;s incomparable nature. The first question could be open to include humans, but may refer to God alone (as the other questions do).</p>
