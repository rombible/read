<A NAME="3052"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=2502><b>sn</b> It is difficult to know for certain what these four things had in common for the sage. They are all linked by the word &#8220;way&#8221; (meaning &#8220;a course of action&#8221;) and by a sense of mystery in each area. Suggestions for the connections between the four include: (1) all four things are hidden from continued observation, for they are in majestic form and then gone; (2) they all have a mysterious means of propulsion or motivation; (3) they all describe the movement of one thing within the sphere or domain of another; or (4) the first three serve as illustrations of the fourth and greatest wonder, which concerns human relationships and is slightly different than the first three.</p>
