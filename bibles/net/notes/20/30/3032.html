<A NAME="3032"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2482><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rakhats</font>) means &#8220;to wash; to wash off; to wash away; to bathe.&#8221; It is used of physical washing, ceremonial washings, and hence figuratively of removing sin and guilt through confession (e.g., Isa 1:16). Here the form is the Pual perfect (unless it is a rare old Qal<i> </i>passive, since there is no Piel and no apparent change of meaning from the Qal). </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The point of the verse is that there are people who observe outer ritual and think they are pure (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1464;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</font> [<font face="Scholar">tahor</font>] is the Levitical standard for entrance into the sanctuary), but who pay no attention to inner cleansing (e.g., Matt 23:27).</p>
