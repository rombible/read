<A NAME="3077"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">77</span><note=2527><b>tn</b> This line provides the explanation for the instruction to keep silent in the previous verse. It uses two images to make the point, and in so doing repeats two words throughout. The first is the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mits</font>), which is translated (in sequence) &#8220;churning,&#8221; &#8220;punching,&#8221; and &#8220;stirring up.&#8221; The form is a noun, and BDB 568 s.v. suggests translating it as &#8220;squeezing&#8221; in all three places, even in the last where it describes the pressure or the insistence on strife. This noun occurs only here. The second repeated word, the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1510;&#1460;&#1497;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yotsir</font>), also occurs three times; it is the Hiphil imperfect, meaning &#8220;produces&#8221; (i.e., causes to go out).</p>
