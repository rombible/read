<A NAME="3054"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=2504><b>sn</b> Equally amazing is the insensitivity of the adulterous woman to the sin. The use of the word &#8220;way&#8221; clearly connects this and the preceding material. Its presence here also supports the interpretation of the final clause in v. 19 as referring to sexual intimacy.
