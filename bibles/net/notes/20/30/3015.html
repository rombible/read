<A NAME="3015"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2465><b>sn</b> The <i>ends of the earth</i> is an expression often used in scripture as a metonymy of subject referring to the people who live in the ends of the earth, the far off and remote lands and islands. While that is possible here as well, this may simply be a synecdoche saying that God created the whole world, even the most remote and distant places.</p>
