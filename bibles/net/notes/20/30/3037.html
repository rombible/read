<A NAME="3037"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=2487><b>sn</b> There are two figures used in each of these lines: teeth/great teeth and &#8220;swords/knives.&#8221; The term &#8220;teeth&#8221; is a metonymy for the process of chewing and eating. This goes with the figure of the second half of the verse that speaks about &#8220;devouring&#8221; the poor &#8211; so the whole image of eating and chewing refers to destroying the poor (an implied comparison). The figures of &#8220;swords/knives&#8221; are metaphors within this image. Comparing teeth to swords means that they are sharp and powerful. The imagery captures the rapacity of their power.</p>
