<A NAME="3061"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=2511><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term means &#8220;hated,&#8221; from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1504;&#1461;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sane</font>&#8217;), a feminine passive participle. The text does not say why she is hated; some have speculated that she might be odious (cf. KJV, ASV, NAB) or unattractive, but perhaps she is married to someone incapable of showing love (e.g., Gen 29:31, 33; Deut 21:15; Isa 60:5). Perhaps the strange situation of Jacob was in the mind of the sage, for Leah was described as &#8220;hated&#8221; (Gen 29:31).</p>
