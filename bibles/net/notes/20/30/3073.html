<A NAME="3073"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">73</span><note=2523><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1494;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zarzir</font>) means &#8220;girt&#8221;; it occurs only here with &#8220;loins&#8221; in the Bible: &#8220;that which is girt in the loins&#8221; (BDB 267 s.v.). Some have interpreted this to be the &#8220;greyhound&#8221; because it is narrow in the flanks (J. H. Greenstone, <i>Proverbs</i>, 327); so KJV, ASV. Others have suggested the warhorse, zebra, raven, or starling. <i>Tg</i>. Prov 30:31 has it as the large fighting cock that struts around among the hens. There is no clear referent that is convincing, although most modern English versions use &#8220;strutting rooster&#8221; or something similar (cf. CEV &#8220;proud roosters&#8221;).</p>
