<A NAME="3066"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=2516><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;hyraxes.&#8221; This is the Syrian Hyrax, also known as the rock badger. KJV, ASV has &#8220;conies&#8221; (alternately spelled &#8220;coneys&#8221; by NIV), a term usually associated with the European rabbit (<i>Oryctolagus cuniculus</i>) but which can also refer to the pika or the hyrax. Scholars today generally agree that the Hebrew term used here refers to a type of hyrax, a small ungulate mammal of the family <i>Procaviidae</i> native to Africa and the Middle East which has a thick body, short legs and ears and a rudimentary tail. The simple &#8220;badger&#8221; (so NASB, NRSV, CEV) could lead to confusion with the badger, an entirely unrelated species of burrowing mammal related to weasels.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Modern scholars identify this creature with the rock badger (the Syrian hyrax), a small mammal that lives in the crevices of the rock. Its wisdom consists in its ingenuity to find a place of security.</p>
