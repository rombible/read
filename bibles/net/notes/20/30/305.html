<A NAME="305"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2455><b>tn</b> There have been numerous attempts to reinterpret the first two verses of the chapter. The Greek version translated the names &#8220;Ithiel&#8221; and &#8220;Ukal,&#8221; resulting in &#8220;I am weary, O God, I am weary and faint&#8221; (C. C. Torrey, &#8220;Proverbs Chapter 30,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 73 [1954]: 93-96). The LXX&#8217;s approach is followed by some English versions (e.g., NRSV, NLT). The Midrash tried through a clever etymologizing translation to attribute the works to Solomon (explained by W. G. Plaut, <i>Proverbs</i>, 299). It is most likely that someone other than Solomon wrote these sayings; they have a different, almost non-proverbial, tone to them. See P. Franklyn, &#8220;The Sayings of Agur in Proverbs 30: Piety or Skepticism,&#8221; <i>ZAW</i> 95 (1983): 239-52.</p>
