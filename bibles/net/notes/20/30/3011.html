<A NAME="3011"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2461><b>tn</b> The epithet &#8220;the Holy One&#8221; is the adjective &#8220;holy&#8221; put in the masculine plural (as in 9:10). This will harmonize with the plural of majesty used to explain the plural with titles for God. However, NRSV takes the plural as a reference to the &#8220;holy ones,&#8221; presumably referring to angelic beings.</p>
