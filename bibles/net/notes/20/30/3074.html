<A NAME="3074"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">74</span><note=2524><b>tc</b> This last line has inspired many suggestions. The MT has &#8220;with his army around him&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; &#1506;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">alqum </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">immo</font>); so NIV. This has been emended to read &#8220;against whom there is no rising up&#8221; (so KJV, ASV) or &#8220;standing over his people.&#8221; The LXX has &#8220;a king haranguing his people.&#8221; <i>Tg</i>. Prov 30:31 has, &#8220;a king who stands up before his people and addresses them.&#8221; Some have attempted to identify this with Alcimus, the high priest who aspired to kingship (1 Macc 7:5-22), but such a suggestion is quite remote. Another interpretation sees the word for &#8220;God&#8221; in the line: &#8220;a king with whom God is.&#8221; Furthermore, C. H. Toy thinks the text is corrupt and must have at one time referred to some majestic animal (<i>Proverbs</i> [ICC], 537). While all these suggestions are fascinating, they have not improved or corrected the Hebrew text. At least one can say the focus is on the stately appearance of the king at some auspicious moment. The word occurs only here; but if it is interpreted with its Arabic cognate in mind, then it refers to a band of soldiers (BDB 39 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;</font>).</p>
