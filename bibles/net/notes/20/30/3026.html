<A NAME="3026"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2476><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kakhash</font>) means &#8220;to be disappointing; to deceive; to fail; to grow lean.&#8221; In the Piel stem it means &#8220;to deceive; to act deceptively; to cringe; to disappoint.&#8221; The idea of acting deceptively is illustrated in Hos 9:2 where it has the connotation of &#8220;disowning&#8221; or &#8220;refusing to acknowledge&#8221; (a meaning very close to its meaning here).</p>
