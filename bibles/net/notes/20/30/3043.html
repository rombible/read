<A NAME="3043"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=2493><b>sn</b> There is a noticeable rhetorical sequence here: <i>two</i> daughters, <i>three</i> things, <i>four</i> (see W. M. Roth, &#8220;The Numerical Sequence <i>x / x +1</i> in the Old Testament,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 12 [1962]: 300-311, and &#8220;Numerical Sayings in the Old Testament,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 13 [1965]: 86). W. McKane thinks the series builds to a climax with the four, and in the four the barren woman is the focal point, the other three being metaphors for her sexual desire (<i>Proverbs </i>[OTL], 656). This interpretation is a minority view, however, and has not won widespread support.</p>
