<A NAME="3031"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2481><b>sn</b> The first observation is that there is a segment in society that lacks respect for parents. This uses the antonyms &#8220;curse&#8221; and [not] &#8220;bless&#8221; to make the point. To &#8220;curse&#8221; a parent could include treating them lightly, defaming them, or showing disrespect in general. To &#8220;bless&#8221; would mean to honor, respect, or enrich in some way, which is what should be done (e.g., Exod 21:17; Prov 20:20).</p>
