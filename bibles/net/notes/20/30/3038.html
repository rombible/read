<A NAME="3038"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=2488><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;teeth&#8221; (so NRSV) or &#8220;jaw teeth&#8221; (so KJV, ASV, NASB) or perhaps &#8220;jawbone.&#8221; This is a different Hebrew word for &#8220;teeth&#8221; than the one in the previous line; if it refers to &#8220;jaw teeth&#8221; then a translation like &#8220;molars&#8221; would be appropriate, although this image might not fit with the metaphor (&#8220;like knives&#8221;) unless the other teeth, the incisors or front teeth, are pictured as being even longer (&#8220;like swords&#8221;).</p>
