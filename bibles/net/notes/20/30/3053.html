<A NAME="3053"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=2503><b>tn</b> This last item in the series is the most difficult to understand. The MT reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456; &#1490;&#1468;&#1462;&#1489;&#1462;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿderekh gever bÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">almah</font>, &#8220;and the way of a man with a maid,&#8221; so KJV, NASB). The last term does not in and of itself mean &#8220;virgin&#8221; but rather describes a young woman who is sexually ready for marriage. What is probably in view here is the wonder of human sexuality, for the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;</font> (<i>bet</i>) in this sequence indicates that the &#8220;way of the man&#8221; is &#8220;with&#8221; the woman. This mystery might begin with the manner of obtaining the love of the young woman, but focuses on the most intimate part of human relationships. And all of this was amazing to the sage. All of it is part of God&#8217;s creative plan and therefore can be enjoyed and appreciated without fully comprehending it.</p>
