<A NAME="3029"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2479><b>tn</b> If what was said were true, then there would be no culpability. But the implication here is that it was slander. And the effect of that will be a curse &#8211; the person who is the target of the slander will &#8220;curse&#8221; the person who slandered him (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1500;</font> [<font face="Scholar">qalal</font>] in the Piel means &#8220;to treat lightly [or, with contempt]; to curse&#8221;), and culpability will result (the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;</font> means &#8220;to be guilty; to make a guilt offering [or, reparation offering]&#8221;). This word for guilt suggests a connection to the Levitical teaching that the guilty had to make reparation for damages done (Lev 5). Cf. NAB &#8220;you will have to pay the penalty&#8221;; NIV, NLT &#8220;you will pay for it.&#8221;</p>
