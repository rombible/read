<A NAME="3028"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2478><b>tn</b> The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">talshen</font>) is the Hiphil jussive (with the negative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>); it is a denominative verb from the noun &#8220;tongue&#8221; <i>(Heb</i> &#8220;wag the tongue&#8221;). It means &#8220;to defame; to slander,&#8221; if the accusation is untrue. Some have suggested that the word might have the force of &#8220;denouncing&#8221; a slave to his master, accusing him before authorities (e.g., Deut 23:15-16). This proverb would then be a warning against meddling in the affairs of someone else.</p>
