<A NAME="2754"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=2271><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;by [the] praise of him.&#8221; The pronominal suffix is an objective genitive, meaning &#8220;the praise about him&#8221; (= &#8220;the praise he receives&#8221;). Some commentators would take the suffix as a subjective genitive, meaning &#8220;the praise he gives&#8221;; this would mean people stand revealed by what they praise (D. Kidner, <i>Proverbs </i>[TOTC], 168). That does not seem to work as well with the emblem of the first line which indicates being tested. The LXX adds a couplet: &#8220;The heart of the transgressor seeks evil; but the upright heart seeks knowledge.&#8221;</p>
