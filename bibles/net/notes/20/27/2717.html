<A NAME="2717"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2234><b>tn</b> Here the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nefesh</font>, traditionally, &#8220;soul&#8221;) is used again, now in contrast to describe the &#8220;hungry appetite&#8221; (cf. NRSV &#8220;ravenous appetite&#8221;), although &#8220;hungry mouth&#8221; might be more idiomatic for the idea. Those whose needs are great are more appreciative of things than those who are satisfied. The needy will be delighted even with bitter things.</p>
