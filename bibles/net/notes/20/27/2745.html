<A NAME="2745"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=2262><b>tn</b> The verse is somewhat cryptic and so has prompted many readings. The first line in the MT has &#8220;As water the face to the face.&#8221; The simplest and most probable interpretation is that clear water gives a reflection of the face (cf. NASB, NIV, NRSV, NLT). One creative but unconvincing suggestion is that of L. Kopf, who suggests the idea is &#8220;water of face&#8221; (a construct) and that it means shame or modesty, i.e., a face is not really human without shame, and a man without a heart is not human (&#8220;Arabische Etymologien und Parallelen zum Bibelwörterbuch,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 9 [1959]: 260-61).</p>
