<A NAME="2739"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=2256><b>tn</b> BDB classifies the verb in the first colon as a Qal apocopated jussive of I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khadah</font>, &#8220;to grow sharp&#8221;; BDB 292 s.v.), and the verb in the second half of the verse (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1491;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yakhad</font>) as a Hiphil apocopated jussive. The difference would be: &#8220;let iron by means of iron grow sharp, and let a man sharpen the countenance of his friend.&#8221; But it makes more sense to take them both as Hiphil forms, the first being in pause. Other suggestions have been put forward for the meaning of the word, but the verb &#8220;sharpens&#8221; fits the context the best, and is followed by most English versions. The verb may be a shortened form of the imperfect rather than a jussive.</p>
