The present translation (along with many English versions) supplies &#8220;reflects&#8221; as a verb in the second line to emphasize the parallelism. </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> In the parallelism this statement means that a person&#8217;s heart is the true reflection of that person. It is in looking at the heart, the will, the choices, the loves, the decisions, the attitudes, that people come to self-awareness. </p>
