<A NAME="2732"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2249><b>sn</b> The point of the proverb is that loud and untimely greetings are not appreciated. What was given as a &#8220;blessing&#8221; will be considered a &#8220;curse&#8221; &#8211; the two words being antonyms. The proverb makes the point that how, when, and why they say what they say is important too (D. Kidner, <i>Proverbs </i>[TOTC], 166).</p>
