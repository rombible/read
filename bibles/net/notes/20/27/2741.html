<A NAME="2741"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=2258><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;sharpens the face of his friend.&#8221; The use of the word &#8220;face&#8221; (cf. KJV, ASV &#8220;countenance&#8221;) would here emphasize that it is the personality or character that is being sharpened. Constructive criticism sharpens character. Use of the wits in interaction that makes two people sharp as a razor (W. McKane, <i>Proverbs </i>[OTL], 615); another example, from the Talmud, is that of two students sharpening each other in the study of the Torah (<i>b. Ta&#8217;anit </i>7a).</p>
