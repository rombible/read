<A NAME="2757"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=2274><b>tn</b> The LXX contains this paraphrase: &#8220;If you scourge a fool in the assembly, dishonoring him, you would not remove his folly.&#8221; This removes the imagery of mortar and pestle from the verse. Using the analogy of pounding something in a mortar, the proverb is saying even if a fool was pounded or pulverized, meaning severe physical punishment, his folly would not leave him &#8211; it is too ingrained in his nature.</p>
