<A NAME="2712"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2229><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term translated &#8220;hidden&#8221; (a Pual participle from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">satar</font>) refers to a love that is carefully concealed; this is contrasted with the open rebuke in the first line. What is described, then, is someone too timid, too afraid, or not trusting enough to admit that reproof is a genuine part of love (W. McKane, <i>Proverbs </i>[OTL], 610). It is a love that is not expressed in proper concern for the one loved. See also, e.g., 28:23 and 29:3.</p>
