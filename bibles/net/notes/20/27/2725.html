<A NAME="2725"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2242><b>sn</b> The expression <i>anyone who taunts me</i> refers to those who would reproach or treat the sage with contempt, condemning him as a poor teacher. Teachers are often criticized for the faults and weaknesses of their students; but any teacher criticized that way takes pleasure in pointing to those who have learned as proof that he has not labored in vain (e.g., 1 Thess 2:19-20; 3:8).</p>
