<A NAME="2710"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2227><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term translated &#8220;jealousy&#8221; here probably has the negative sense of &#8220;envy&#8221; rather than the positive sense of &#8220;zeal.&#8221; It is a raging emotion (like &#8220;anger&#8221; and &#8220;wrath,&#8221; this word has nuances of heat, intensity) that defies reason at times and can be destructive like a consuming fire (e.g., 6:32-35; Song 8:6-7). The rhetorical question is intended to affirm that no one can survive a jealous rage. (Whether one is the subject who is jealous or the object of the jealousy of someone else is not so clear.)</p>
