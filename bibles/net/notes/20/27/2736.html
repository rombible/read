<A NAME="2736"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=2253><b>sn</b> The verb is the Qal imperfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qara</font>&#8217;); BDB 895 s.v. 5.b defines it here as &#8220;call for = demand, require,&#8221; but acknowledge that it is probably corrupt. R. B. Y. Scott interprets it to mean &#8220;grasping&#8221; oil in the hand, an expression he compares to the modern &#8220;butterfingers&#8221; (<i>Proverbs, Ecclesiastes</i> [AB], 163). Others have interpreted it to mean &#8220;betrays&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;ointment of his right hand betrays itself,&#8221; meaning its smell persists. However, the connection to the proverb does not seem obvious with that interpretation.</p>
