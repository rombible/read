<A NAME="2730"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2247><b>tn</b> The verse begins with the Piel participle from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">barach</font>). It could be taken as the subject, with the resulting translation: &#8220;Blessing&#8230;will be counted as a curse.&#8221; However, that would be rather awkward. So it is preferable to take the first line as the condition (&#8220;if someone blesses&#8221;) and the second as the consequence (&#8220;[then] it will be counted&#8221;).</p>
