<A NAME="2721"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2238><b>tn</b> Some think the MT is unintelligible as it stands: &#8220;The sweetness of his friend from the counsel of the soul.&#8221; The Latin version has &#8220;the soul is sweetened by the good counsels of a friend.&#8221; D. W. Thomas suggests, &#8220;counsels of a friend make sweet the soul&#8221; (&#8220;Notes on Some Passages in the Book of Proverbs,&#8221; <i>VT </i>15 [1965]: 275). G. R. Driver suggests, &#8220;the counsel of a friend is sweeter than one&#8217;s own advice&#8221; (literally, &#8220;more than the counsel of the soul&#8221;). He also suggests &#8220;more than of fragrant wood.&#8221; See G. R. Driver, &#8220;Hebrew Notes,&#8221; <i>ZAW</i> 52 (1934): 54; <i>idem</i>, &#8220;Suggestions and Objections,&#8221; <i>ZAW</i> 55 (1937): 69-70. The LXX reads &#8220;and the soul is rent by misfortunes.&#8221; The MT, for want of better or more convincing readings, may be interpreted to mean something like &#8220;[Just as] ointment and incense brings joy to the heart, [so] the sweetness of one&#8217;s friend [comes] from his sincere counsel.&#8221;</p>
