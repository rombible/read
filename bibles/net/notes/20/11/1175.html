<A NAME="1175"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">75</span><note=921><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;taste.&#8221; The term can refer to physical taste (Exod 16:31), intellectual discretion (1 Sam 25:33), or ethical judgment (Ps 119:66). Here it probably means that she has no moral sensibility, no propriety, no good taste &#8211; she is unchaste. Her beauty will be put to wrong uses.</p>
