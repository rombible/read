<A NAME="1132"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=878><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;despises&#8221; (so NASB) or &#8220;belittles&#8221; (so NRSV). The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1494;</font> (<font face="Scholar">baz</font>, from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;</font>, <font face="Scholar">buz</font>) means &#8220;to despise; to show contempt for&#8221; someone. It reflects an attitude of pride and judgmentalism. In view of the parallel line, in this situation it would reflect perhaps some public denunciation of another person.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> According to Proverbs (and the Bible as a whole) how one treats a neighbor is an important part of righteousness. One was expected to be a good neighbor, and to protect and safeguard the life and reputation of a neighbor.</p>
