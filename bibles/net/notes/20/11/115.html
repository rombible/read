<A NAME="115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=851><b>tn</b> The verbs show both the sequence and the correlation. The first is the perfect tense of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bo</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to enter; to come&#8221;); it is followed by the preterite with <i>vav</i> consecutive from the same verb, showing that one follows or comes with the other. Because the second verb in the colon is sequential to the first, the first may be subordinated as a temporal clause.</p>
