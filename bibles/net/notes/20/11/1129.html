<A NAME="1129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=875><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;the blessing of the upright.&#8221; This expression features either an objective or subjective genitive. It may refer to the blessing God gives the upright (which will benefit society) or the blessing that the upright are to the city. The latter fits the parallelism best: The blessings are the beneficent words and deeds that the righteous perform.</p>
