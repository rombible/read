<A NAME="1177"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">77</span><note=923><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;leads to&#8221; does not appear in the Hebrew text but has been supplied in the translation. The desire of the righteous (in itself good) ends in good things, whereas the hope of the wicked ends in wrath, i.e., divine judgment on them. Another interpretation is that the righteous desire is to do good things, but the wicked hope to produce wrath (cf. CEV &#8220;troublemakers hope to stir up trouble&#8221;).</p>
