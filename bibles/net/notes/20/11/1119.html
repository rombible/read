<A NAME="1119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=865><b>tc</b> There are several suggested changes for this word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">onim</font>, &#8220;vigor&#8221; or &#8220;strength&#8221;). Rashi, a Jewish scholar who lived <sc>a.d. 1040-1105, suggests that the word refers to children, a meaning implied from Gen 49:3. This would mean that even his children would not benefit from his wickedness. <i>Tg</i>. Prov 11:7 rendered it &#8220;who practice crookedness,&#8221; deriving it from the first root which means &#8220;wickedness.&#8221;</p>
