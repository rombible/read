<A NAME="311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2530><b>sn</b> Nothing else is known about <i>King Lemuel</i> aside from this mention in the book of Proverbs. Jewish legend identifies him as Solomon, making this advice from his mother Bathsheba; but there is no evidence for that. The passage is the only direct address to a king in the book of Proverbs &#8211; something that was the norm in wisdom literature of the ancient world (Leah L. Brunner, &#8220;King and Commoner in Proverbs and Near Eastern Sources,&#8221; <i>Dor le Dor</i> 10 [1982]: 210-19; Brunner argues that the advice is religious and not secular).</p>
<A NAME="312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2531><b>tn</b> Some English versions take the Hebrew noun translated &#8220;oracle&#8221; here as a place name specifying the kingdom of King Lemuel; cf. NAB &#8220;king of Massa&#8221;; CEV &#8220;King Lemuel of Massa.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2532><b>tn</b> The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mah</font>), normally the interrogative &#8220;what?&#8221; (so KJV, ASV, NAB, NASB) is best interpreted here as an exclamation. <i>Tg</i>. Prov 31:2 has &#8220;Woe!&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2533><b>tn</b> In all three occurrences in this verse the word &#8220;son&#8221; has the Aramaic spelling, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1463;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bar</font>), rather than the Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ben</font>). The repetition of the word &#8220;son&#8221; shows the seriousness of the warning; and the expression &#8220;son of my womb&#8221; and &#8220;son of my vows&#8221; are endearing epithets to show the great investment she has made in his religious place in God&#8217;s program. For a view that &#8220;son of my womb&#8221; should be &#8220;my own son,&#8221; see F. Deist, &#8220;Proverbs 31:1, A Case of Constant Mistranslation,&#8221; <i>JNSL</i> 6 (1978): 1-3; cf. TEV &#8220;my own dear son.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2534><b>sn</b> The word translated &#8220;strength&#8221; refers to physical powers here, i.e., &#8220;vigor&#8221; (so NAB) or &#8220;stamina.&#8221; It is therefore a metonymy of cause; the effect would be what spending this strength meant &#8211; sexual involvement with women. It would be easy for a king to spend his energy enjoying women, but that would be unwise.</p>
<A NAME="316"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2535><b>sn</b> The word &#8220;ways&#8221; may in general refer to the heart&#8217;s affection for or attention to, or it may more specifically refer to sexual intercourse. While in the book of Proverbs the term is an idiom for the course of life, in this context it must refer to the energy spent in this activity.</p>
<A NAME="317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2536><b>tn</b> The construction uses Qal infinitive construct <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1463;&#1502;&#1456;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lamkhot</font>, &#8220;to wipe out; to blot out; to destroy&#8221;). The construction is somewhat strange, and so some interpreters suggest changing it to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1465;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mokhot</font>, &#8220;destroyers of kings&#8221;); cf. BDB 562 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1495;&#1464;&#1492;</font> Qal.3. Commentators note that the form is close to an Aramaic word that means &#8220;concubine,&#8221; and an Arabic word that is an indelicate description for women.</p>
<A NAME="318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2537><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[It is] not for kings.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="319"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2538><b>sn</b> This second warning for kings concerns the use of alcohol. If this passage is meant to prohibit any use of alcohol by kings, it would be unheard of in any ancient royal court. What is probably meant is an excessive and unwarranted use of alcohol, or a troubling need for it, so that the meaning is &#8220;to drink wine in excess&#8221; (cf. NLT &#8220;to guzzle wine&#8221;; CEV &#8220;should not get drunk&#8221;). The danger, of course, would be that excessive use of alcohol would cloud the mind and deprive a king of true administrative ability and justice.</p>
<A NAME="3110"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2539><b>tn</b> The MT has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1493;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ev</font>), a <i>Kethib</i>/<i>Qere</i> reading. The <i>Kethib </i>is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">o</font>) but the <i>Qere</i> is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ey</font>). Some follow the <i>Qere</i> and take the word as a shortened form of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1465;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font>, &#8220;where?&#8221; This would mean the ruler would be always asking for drink (cf. ASV). Others reconstruct to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1493;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avveh</font>, &#8220;to desire; to crave&#8221;). In either case, the verse would be saying that a king is not to be wanting/seeking alcohol.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> Here &#8220;strong drink&#8221; probably refers to barley beer (cf. NIV, NCV &#8220;beer&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="3111"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2540><b>tn</b> The verb means &#8220;change,&#8221; perhaps expressed in reversing decisions or removing rights.</p>
<A NAME="3112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2541><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all the children of poverty.&#8221; This expression refers to the poor by nature. Cf. KJV, NASB, NRSV &#8220;the afflicted&#8221;; NIV &#8220;oppressed.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2542><b>sn</b> The word is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">din</font>, &#8220;judgment&#8221;; so KJV). In this passage it refers to the cause or the plea for justice, i.e., the &#8220;legal rights.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2543><b>sn</b> Wine and beer should be given to those distressed and dying in order to ease their suffering and help them forget.</p>
<A NAME="3115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2544><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;to the bitter of soul.&#8221; The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497; &#1504;&#1464;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿmare nafesh</font>) has been translated &#8220;of heavy hearts&#8221; (KJV); &#8220;in anguish&#8221; (NIV); &#8220;in misery&#8221; (TEV); &#8220;in bitter distress&#8221; (NRSV); &#8220;sorely depressed&#8221; (NAB); &#8220;in deep depression (NLT); &#8220;have lost all hope&#8221; (CEV). The word &#8220;bitter&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">mar</font>) describes the physical and mental/spiritual suffering as a result of affliction, grief, or suffering &#8211; these people are in emotional pain. So the idea of &#8220;bitterly distressed&#8221; works as well as any other translation.</p>
<A NAME="3116"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2545><b>tn</b> The subjects and suffixes are singular (cf. KJV, ASV, NASB). Most other English versions render this as plural for stylistic reasons, in light of the preceding context.</p>
<A NAME="3117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2546><b>tn</b> The king was not to &#8220;drink and forget&#8221;; the suffering are to &#8220;drink and forget.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3118"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2547><b>sn</b> The instruction to &#8220;open your mouth&#8221; is a metonymy of cause; it means &#8220;speak up for&#8221; (so NIV, TEV, NLT) or in this context &#8220;serve as an advocate in judgment&#8221; (cf. CEV &#8220;you must defend&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="3119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2548><b>sn</b> The instruction compares people who cannot defend themselves in court with those who are physically unable to speak (this is a figure of speech known as hypocatastasis, an implied comparison). The former can physically speak; but because they are the poor, the uneducated, the oppressed, they are unable to conduct a legal defense. They may as well be speechless.</p>
<A NAME="3120"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2549><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;of all the defenseless.&#8221; The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1458;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khalof</font>) means &#8220;passing away; vanishing&#8221; (properly an infinitive); in this construction &#8220;the sons of the passing away&#8221; means people who by nature are transitory, people who are dying &#8211; mortals. But in this context it would indicate people who are &#8220;defenseless&#8221; as opposed to those who are healthy and powerful.</p>
<A NAME="3121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2550><b>tn</b> The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1462;&#1491;&#1462;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsedeq</font>) serves here as an adverbial accusative of manner. The decisions reached (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1464;&#1496;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shÿfat</font>) in this advocacy must conform to the standard of the law. So it is a little stronger than &#8220;judging fairly&#8221; (cf. NIV, NCV), although it will be fair if it is done righteously for all.</p>
<A NAME="3122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2551><b>sn</b> Previously the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">din</font>, judgment&#8221;) was used, signifying the legal rights or the pleas of the people. Now the imperative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font> is used. It could be translated &#8220;judge,&#8221; but in this context &#8220;judge the poor&#8221; could be misunderstood to mean &#8220;condemn.&#8221; Here advocacy is in view, and so &#8220;plead the cause&#8221; is a better translation (cf. NASB, NIV, NRSV &#8220;defend the rights&#8221;). It was &#8211; and is &#8211; the responsibility of the king (ruler) to champion the rights of the poor and needy, who otherwise would be ignored and oppressed. They are the ones left destitute by the cruelties and inequalities of life (e.g., 2 Sam 14:4-11; 1 Kgs 3:16-28; Pss 45:3-5, 72:4; Isa 9:6-7).</p>
<A NAME="3123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2552><b>sn</b> The book of Proverbs comes to a close with this poem about the noble wife. A careful reading of the poem will show that it is extolling godly wisdom that is beneficial to the family and the society. Traditionally it has been interpreted as a paradigm for godly women. And while that is valid in part, there is much more here. The poem captures all the themes of wisdom that have been presented in the book and arranges them in this portrait of the ideal woman (Claudia V. Camp, <i>Wisdom and the Feminine in the Book of Proverbs</i>, 92-93). Any careful reading of the passage would have to conclude that if it were merely a paradigm for women what it portrays may well be out of reach &#8211; she is a wealthy aristocrat who runs an estate with servants and conducts business affairs of real estate, vineyards, and merchandising, and also takes care of domestic matters and is involved with charity. Moreover, it says nothing about the woman&#8217;s personal relationship with her husband, her intellectual and emotional strengths, or her religious activities (E. Jacob, &#8220;Sagesse et Alphabet: Pr. 31:10-31,&#8221; <i>Hommages à A. Dont-Sommer</i>, 287-95). In general, it appears that the &#8220;woman&#8221; of Proverbs 31 is a symbol of all that wisdom represents. The poem, then, plays an important part in the personification of wisdom so common in the ancient Near East. But rather than deify Wisdom as the other ANE cultures did, Proverbs simply describes wisdom as a woman. Several features will stand out in the study of this passage. First, it is an alphabetic arrangement of the virtues of wisdom (an acrostic poem). Such an acrostic was a way of organizing the thoughts and making them more memorable (M. H. Lichtenstein, &#8220;Chiasm and Symmetry in Proverbs 31,&#8221; <i>CBQ</i> 44 [1982]: 202-11). Second, the passage is similar to hymns, but this one extols wisdom. A comparison with Psalm 111 will illustrate the similarities. Third, the passage has similarities with heroic literature. The vocabulary and the expressions often sound more like an ode to a champion than to a domestic scene. Putting these features together, one would conclude that Proverbs 31:10-31 is a hymn to Lady Wisdom, written in the heroic mode. Using this arrangement allows the sage to make all the lessons of wisdom in the book concrete and practical, it provides a polemic against the culture that saw women as merely decorative, and it depicts the greater heroism as moral and domestic rather than only exploits on the battlefield. The poem certainly presents a pattern for women to follow. But it also presents a pattern for men to follow as well, for this is the message of the book of Proverbs in summary. </p>
<A NAME="3124"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2553><b>sn</b> The poem begins with a rhetorical question (a figure of speech known as erotesis). This is intended to establish the point that such a noble wife is rare. As with wisdom in the book of Proverbs, she has to be found.</p>
<A NAME="3125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2554><b>tn</b> The first word in the Hebrew text (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1514;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">eshet</font>) begins with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">alef</font>), the first letter in the Hebrew alphabet.</p>
<A NAME="3126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2555><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a woman of valor.&#8221; This is the same expression used to describe Ruth (e.g., Ruth 3:11). The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khayil</font>) here means &#8220;moral worth&#8221; (BDB 298 s.v.); cf. KJV &#8220;a virtuous woman.&#8221; Elsewhere the term is used of physical valor in battle, e.g., &#8220;mighty man of valor,&#8221; the land-owning aristocrat who could champion the needs of his people in times of peace or war (e.g., Judg 6:12). Here the title indicates that the woman possesses all the virtues, honor, and strength to do the things that the poem will set forth. </p>
<A NAME="3127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2556><b>sn</b> This line expresses that her value (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;her price&#8221;), like wisdom, is worth more than rubies (e.g., 3:15; 8:11).</p>
<A NAME="3128"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2557><b>tn</b> The first word of the second line begins with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;</font> (<i>bet</i>), the second letter in the Hebrew alphabet. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1496;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">batakh</font>) means &#8220;to trust; to have confidence in.&#8221; With the subject of the verb being &#8220;the heart of her husband,&#8221; the idea is strengthened &#8211; he truly trusts her. Cf. NCV &#8220;trusts her completely&#8221;; NIV &#8220;has full confidence in her.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2558><b>sn</b> The Hebrew word used here for &#8220;gain&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1500;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shalal</font>) is unusual; it means &#8220;plunder; spoil&#8221; of war primarily (e.g., Isa 8:1-4 and the name Maher-<i>Shalal</i>-Hash-Baz). The point is that the gain will be as rich and bountiful as the spoils of war. The wife&#8217;s capabilities in business and domestic matters guarantee a rich profit and inspire the confidence of her husband.</p>
<A NAME="3130"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2559><b>tn</b> The first word of the third line begins with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;</font> (<i>gimel</i>), the third letter of the Hebrew alphabet.</p>
<A NAME="3131"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2560><b>sn</b> The joining of these two words, &#8220;good&#8221; and &#8220;evil,&#8221; is frequent in the Bible; they contrast the prosperity and well-being of her contribution with what would be devastating and painful. The way of wisdom is always characterized by &#8220;good&#8221;; the way of folly is associated with &#8220;evil.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="3132"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2561><b>tn</b> The first word of the fourth line begins with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;</font> (<i>dalet</i>) the fourth letter of the Hebrew alphabet. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">darash</font>) means &#8220;to seek; to inquire; to investigate.&#8221; The idea is that she looks for the wool and flax to do her work, but the whole verse assumes she has obtained it. This verb also occurs in the hymn of Ps 111, which says in v. 2 that &#8220;the works of the <sc>Lord are <i>searched</i>.&#8221; One word used in another passage is not that significant; but the cumulative effect of words and ideas suggest that the composition of this poem is influenced by hymnology.</p>
<A NAME="3133"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=2562><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and she works in the pleasure of her hands.&#8221; The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1461;&#1508;&#1462;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khefets</font>) means &#8220;delight; pleasure.&#8221; BDB suggests it means here &#8220;that in which one takes pleasure,&#8221; i.e., a business, and translates the line &#8220;in the business of her hands&#8221; (BDB 343 s.v. 4). But that translation reduces the emphasis on pleasure and could have easily been expressed in other ways. Here it is part of the construct relationship. The &#8220;hands&#8221; are the metonymy of cause, representing all her skills and activities in making things. It is also a genitive of specification, making &#8220;pleasure&#8221; the modifier of &#8220;her hands/her working.&#8221; She does her work with pleasure. <i>Tg</i>. Prov 31:13 has, &#8220;she works with her hands in accordance with her pleasure.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="3134"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=2563><b>tn</b> The first word of the fifth line begins with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;</font> (<i>he</i>), the fifth letter of the Hebrew alphabet. </p>
<A NAME="3135"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=2564><b>sn</b> The point of the simile is that she goes wherever she needs to go, near and far, to gather in all the food for the needs and the likes of the family. The line captures the vision and the industry of this woman.</p>
<A NAME="3136"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=2565><b>tn</b> The first word of the sixth line begins with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font> (<i>vav</i>), the sixth letter of the Hebrew alphabet.</p>
<A NAME="3137"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=2566><b>sn</b> The word for &#8220;food&#8221; is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">teref</font>, &#8220;prey&#8221;; KJV &#8220;meat&#8221;), another word that does not normally fit the domestic scene. This word also is used in a similar way in Ps 111:5, which says the <sc>Lord gives food. Here it is the noble woman who gives food to her family and servants.</p>
<A NAME="3138"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=2567><b>sn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1465;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khoq</font>) probably means &#8220;allotted portion of food&#8221; as before, but some suggest it means the task that is allotted to the servants, meaning that the wise woman gets up early enough to give out the work assignments (<i>Tg</i>. Prov 31:15, RSV, NRSV, TEV, NLT). That is possible, but seems an unnecessary direction for the line to take. Others, however, simply wish to delete this last colon, leaving two cola and not three, but that is unwarranted.</p>
<A NAME="3139"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=2568><b>tn</b> The first word of the seventh line begins with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;</font> (<i>zayin</i>), the seventh letter of the Hebrew alphabet.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The word &#8220;considers&#8221; means &#8220;to plan carefully&#8221; in accordance with her purposes. The word is often used in the book of Proverbs for devising evil; but here it is used positively of the woman&#8217;s wise investment. </p>
<A NAME="3140"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=2569><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from the fruit of her hands.&#8221; The expression employs two figures. &#8220;Hands&#8221; is a metonymy of cause, indicating the work she does. &#8220;Fruit&#8221; is a hypocatastasis, an implied comparison meaning what she produces, the income she earns. She is able to plant a vineyard from her income.</p>
<A NAME="3141"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=2570><b>tn</b> The first word of the eighth line begins with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;</font> (<i>khet</i>), the eighth letter of the Hebrew alphabet.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;she girds her loins with strength.&#8221; The idea is that of gathering up the long robes with a sash or belt so that they do not get in the way of the work. The point of the figure is readiness for work. But to say she girds herself with &#8220;strength&#8221; means that she begins vigorously. &#8220;Strength&#8221; here would be a comparison with the sash.</p>

The word is taken in the versions with the word that follows (&#8220;covers&#8221;) to means &#8220;double garments.&#8221; The question to be asked is whether scarlet would keep one warm in winter or double garments.

(2) The word &#8220;love&#8221; should probably have more of the emphasis on its basic meaning of &#8220;loyal love, lovingkindness.&#8221; It also would be an attributive genitive, but its force would be that of &#8220;loving instruction&#8221; or &#8220;teaching with kindness.&#8221;</p>
