<A NAME="191"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1617><b>sn</b> People should follow honesty even if it leads to poverty (e.g., Prov 18:23; 19:22).</p>
<A NAME="192"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1618><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;lips.&#8221; The term &#8220;lips&#8221; is a metonymy for what one says with his lips. The expression &#8220;perverse in his lips&#8221; refers to speech that is morally perverted. Some medieval Hebrew <sc>mss, the Syriac, and <i>Tg</i>. Prov 19:1 have &#8220;his ways&#8221; rather than &#8220;his lips&#8221; (e.g., Prov 28:6); cf. NAB. </p>
<A NAME="193"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1619><b>tc</b> The Syriac and <i>Tg</i>. Prov 19:1 read &#8220;rich&#8221; instead of MT &#8220;fool.&#8221; This makes tighter antithetical parallelism than MT and is followed by NAB. However, the MT makes sense as it stands; this is an example of metonymical parallelism. The MT reading is also supported by the LXX. The Hebrew construction uses <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿhu</font>&#8217;), &#8220;and he [is],&#8221; before &#8220;fool.&#8221; This may be rendered &#8220;one who is perverse while a fool&#8221; or &#8220;a fool at the same time.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="194"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1620><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;not good.&#8221; This is a figure known as tapeinosis (a deliberate understatement to emphasize a worst-case scenario): &#8220;it is dangerous!&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="195"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1621><b>tn</b> The interpretation of this line depends largely on the meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nefesh</font>) which has a broad range of meanings: (1) the breathing substance of man, (2) living being, (3) life, (4) person, (5) seat of the appetites, (6) seat of emotions and passions, (7) activities of intellect, emotion and will, (8) moral character, etc. (BDB 659-61 s.v.). In light of the synonymous parallelism, the most likely nuance here is &#8220;zeal, passion&#8221; (<i>HALOT </i>713 s.v. 8). NIV takes the word in the sense of &#8220;vitality&#8221; and &#8220;drive&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;it is not good to have zeal without knowledge&#8221; (cf. NCV, TEV, and NLT which are all similar). </p>
<A NAME="196"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1622><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he who is hasty with his feet.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">uts</font>) means &#8220;to be pressed; to press; to make haste.&#8221; The verb is followed by the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;</font> (<i>bet</i>) which indicates that with which one hastens &#8211; his feet. The word &#8220;feet&#8221; is a synecdoche of part for the whole person &#8211; body and mind working together (cf. NLT &#8220;a person who moves too quickly&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="197"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1623><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;misses the goal.&#8221; The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1496;&#1461;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khote</font>&#8217;) can be translated &#8220;sins&#8221; (cf. KJV, ASV), but in this context it refers only to actions without knowledge, which could lead to sin, or could lead simply to making poor choices (cf. NAB &#8220;blunders&#8221;; NASB &#8220;errs&#8221;; NCV &#8220;might make a mistake&#8221;). </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The basic meaning of the verb is &#8220;to miss a goal or the way.&#8221; D. Kidner says, &#8220;How negative is the achievement of a man who wants tangible and quick rewards&#8221; &#8211; he will miss the way (<i>Proverbs </i>[TOTC], 132). </p>
<A NAME="198"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1624><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the folly of a man.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="199"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1625><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">salaf</font>) normally means &#8220;to twist; to pervert; to overturn,&#8221; but in this context it means &#8220;to subvert&#8221; (BDB 701 s.v.); cf. ASV &#8220;subverteth.&#8221; </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> J. H. Greenstone comments: &#8220;Man&#8217;s own failures are the result of his own folly and should not be attributed to God&#8221; (<i>Proverbs</i>, 201).</p>
<A NAME="1910"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1626><b>tn</b> The clause begins with <i>vav</i> on the nonverb phrase &#8220;against the <sc>Lord.&#8221; While clause structure and word order is less compelling in a book like Proverbs, this fits well as a circumstantial clause indicating concession.</p>
<A NAME="1911"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1627><b>sn</b> The &#8220;heart raging&#8221; is a metonymy of cause (or adjunct); it represents the emotions that will lead to blaming God for the frustration. Genesis 42:28 offers a calmer illustration of this as the brothers ask what God was doing to them. </p>
<A NAME="1912"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1628><b>tn</b> The Niphal imperfect probably should be taken in the passive sense (the poor person is deserted by his &#8220;friend,&#8221; cf. NAB, NIV) rather than as a direct middle (the poor person deserted his friend).</p>
<A NAME="1913"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1629><b>sn</b> This proverb simply makes an observation on life: People pursue wealthy folk hoping that they can gain something from the rich, but the poor are deserted even by friends, who fear that the poor will try to gain something from them.</p>
<A NAME="1914"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1630><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a witness of lies.&#8221; This expression is an attributive genitive: &#8220;a lying witness&#8221; (cf. CEV &#8220;dishonest witnesses&#8221;). This is paralleled by &#8220;the one who pours out lies.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="1915"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1631><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;breathes out&#8221;; NAB &#8220;utters&#8221;; NIV &#8220;pours out.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1916"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1632><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;will not escape&#8221; (so NAB, NASB); NIV &#8220;will not go free.&#8221; Here &#8220;punishment&#8221; is implied, and has been supplied in the translation for clarity. </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This proverb is a general statement, because on occasion there are false witnesses who go unpunished in this life (e.g., Prov 6:19; 14:5, 25; 19:9). The Talmud affirms, &#8220;False witnesses are contemptible even to those who hire them&#8221; (<i>b. Sanhedrin </i>29b).</p>
<A NAME="1917"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1633><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿkhalu</font>) is a Piel imperfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khalah</font>) meaning &#8220;to seek favor; to entreat favor; to mollify; to appease&#8221;; cf. NIV &#8220;curry favor.&#8221; It literally means &#8220;making the face of someone sweet or pleasant,&#8221; as in stroking the face. To &#8220;entreat the favor&#8221; of someone is to induce him to show favor; the action aims at receiving gifts, benefits, or any other kind of success. </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The Hebrew verb translated &#8220;entreat the favor&#8221; is often used to express prayer when God is the one whose favor is being sought; here it is the prince who can grant requests.</p>
<A NAME="1918"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1634><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;the face of a generous man&#8221;; ASV &#8220;the liberal man.&#8221; The term &#8220;face&#8221; is a synecdoche of part (= face) for the whole (= person).</p>
<A NAME="1919"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1635><b>sn</b> The proverb acknowledges the fact of life; but it also reminds people of the value of gifts in life, especially in business or in politics.</p>
<A NAME="1920"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1636><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a man of gifts.&#8221; This could be (1) attributive genitive: a man characterized by giving gifts or (2) objective genitive: a man who gives gifts (<i>IBHS</i> 146 §9.5.2b).</p>
<A NAME="1921"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1637><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;brothers,&#8221; but not limited only to male siblings in this context.</p>
<A NAME="1922"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1638><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;hate him.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1504;&#1461;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sane</font>&#8217;) may be nuanced &#8220;reject&#8221; here (metonymy of effect, cf. CEV). The kind of &#8220;dislike&#8221; or &#8220;hatred&#8221; family members show to a poor relative is to have nothing to do with him (NIV &#8220;is shunned&#8221;). If relatives do this, how much more will the poor person&#8217;s friends do so. </p>
<A NAME="1923"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1639><b>tn</b> The direct object &#8220;them&#8221; does not appear in the Hebrew but is supplied in the translation for the sake of smoothness.</p>
<A NAME="1924"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1640><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;not they.&#8221; The last line of the verse is problematic. The preceding two lines are loosely synonymous in their parallelism, but the third adds something like: &#8220;he pursues [them with] words, but they [do] not [respond].&#8221; Some simply say it is a corrupt remnant of a separate proverb and beyond restoration. The basic idea does make sense, though. The idea of his family and friends rejecting the poor person reveals how superficial they are, and how they make themselves scarce. Since they are far off, he has to look for them &#8220;with words&#8221; (adverbial accusative), that is, &#8220;send word&#8221; for help. But they &#8220;are nowhere to be found&#8221; (so NIV). The LXX reads &#8220;will not be delivered&#8221; in place of &#8220;not they&#8221; &#8211; clearly an attempt to make sense out of the cryptic phrase, and, in the process, showing evidence for that text.</p>
<A NAME="1925"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1641><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;heart.&#8221; Most English versions translate as &#8220;wisdom,&#8221; but cf. NAB &#8220;intelligence.&#8221; This refers to a mind that works (e.g., Prov 7:7; 9:4).</p>
<A NAME="1926"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1642><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his own soul.&#8221; The expression &#8220;loves his soul&#8221; means that he is paying attention to his needs or taking care of his life (cf. NAB &#8220;is his own best friend&#8221;). This expression works with its parallel to provide the whole idea: &#8220;loving the soul&#8221; is the metonymy of the cause for prospering, and &#8220;prospering&#8221; is the metonymy of the effect (of loving).</p>
<A NAME="1927"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1643><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;finds good&#8221; (similar KJV, NASB); NCV &#8220;will succeed.&#8221; The MT reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1510;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">limtso</font>&#8217;), a Qal infinitive construct. The LXX (as well as the other major early versions) renders it as a future, which reflects a <i>Vorlage</i> of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yimtsa</font>&#8217;). The infinitive is used here in a modal sense, meaning &#8220;is destined to&#8221; or &#8220;is certain of&#8221; finding good in life. </p>
<A NAME="1928"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1644><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;breathes out&#8221;; NAB &#8220;utters&#8221;; NIV &#8220;pours out.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1929"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1645><b>sn</b> The verse is the same as v. 5, except that the last word changes to the verb &#8220;will perish&#8221; (cf. NCV &#8220;will die&#8221;; CEV, NLT &#8220;will be destroyed&#8221;; TEV &#8220;is doomed&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="1930"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1646><b>tn</b> The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1488;&#1493;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">na</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">veh</font>) is an adjective meaning &#8220;seemly; comely&#8221; in the older English versions like KJV, ASV, &#8220;fitting&#8221; in more recent ones (e.g., NASB, NIV, NRSV). The verbal root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1493;&#1465;&#1492;</font> only occurs in the Pilel stem; but it also has the basic meaning of &#8220;being fitting; being comely.&#8221; In this sentence the form is a predicate adjective.</p>
<A NAME="1931"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1647><b>sn</b> The verse is simply observing two things that are misfits. It is not concerned with a fool who changes and can handle wealth, or a servant who changes to become a nobleman. It is focused on things that are incongruous.</p>
<A NAME="1932"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1648><b>sn</b> In the ancient world the prince would be trained for his rule (hence, one of the original purposes of Proverbs). A slave ruling over princes would be arrogant and cruel, or foolish and unwise. For other unbearable things, e.g., 11:22; 17:7; 26:1; and 30:21-23.</p>
<A NAME="1933"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1649><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;prudence,&#8221; the successful use of wisdom in discretion. Cf. NAB, NRSV, NLT &#8220;good sense.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1934"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1650><b>tn</b> The Hiphil perfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arakh</font>, &#8220;to be long&#8221;) means &#8220;to make long; to prolong.&#8221; Patience and slowness to anger lead to forgiveness of sins.</p>
<A NAME="1935"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1651><b>sn</b> &#8220;Glory&#8221; signifies the idea of beauty or adornment. D. Kidner explains that such patience &#8220;brings out here the glowing colours of a virtue which in practice may look drably unassertive&#8221; (<i>Proverbs </i>[TOTC], 133).</p>
<A NAME="1936"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1652><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to pass over&#8221; (so KJV, ASV); NCV, TEV &#8220;ignore.&#8221; The infinitive construct <b><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1489;&#1465;&#1512;</font></b> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avor</font>) functions as the formal subject of the sentence. This clause provides the cause, whereas the former gave the effect &#8211; if one can pass over an offense there will be no anger.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> W. McKane says, &#8220;The virtue which is indicated here is more than a forgiving temper; it includes also the ability to shrug off insults and the absence of a brooding hypersensitivity&#8230;. It contains elements of toughness and self-discipline; it is the capacity to stifle a hot, emotional rejoinder and to sleep on an insult&#8221; (<i>Proverbs </i>[OTL], 530). </p>
<A NAME="1937"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1653><b>sn</b> The verse contrasts the &#8220;rage&#8221; of the king with his &#8220;favor&#8221; by using two similes. The first simile presents the king at his most dangerous &#8211; his anger (e.g., 20:2; Amos 3:4). The second simile presents his favor as beneficial for life (e.g., 16:14-15; 28:15).</p>
<A NAME="1938"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1654><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;is a roaring like a lion.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1939"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1655><b>sn</b> The proverb makes an observation about a king&#8217;s power to terrify or to refresh. It advises people to use tact with a king.</p>
<A NAME="1940"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1656><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a foolish son&#8221; (so KJV, NAB, NIV, CEV); NRSV &#8220;a stupid child.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1941"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1657><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the contentions of a wife&#8221; (so KJV, NASB); NAB &#8220;the nagging of a wife.&#8221; The genitive could be interpreted (1) as genitive of source or subjective genitive &#8211; she is quarreling; or (2) it could be a genitive of specification, making the word &#8220;contentions&#8221; a modifier, as in the present translation.</p>
<A NAME="1942"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1658><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;is a constant dripping.&#8221; The term &#8220;like&#8221; does not appear in the Hebrew but is supplied in the translation for the sake of clarity. The metaphor pictures water dropping (perhaps rain through the roof, cf. NRSV, CEV) in a continuous flow: It is annoying and irritating (e.g., Prov 27:15-16).</p>
<A NAME="1943"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1659><b>tc</b> The LXX makes this moralistic statement for 13b: &#8220;vows paid out of hire of a harlot are not pure.&#8221; It is not based on the MT and attempts to reconstruct a text using this have been unsuccessful. </p>
<A NAME="1944"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1660><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;inheritance of fathers&#8221; (so KJV, ASV, NASB).</p>
<A NAME="1945"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1661><b>sn</b> This statement describes a wife who has a skillful use of knowledge and discretion that proves to be successful. This contrasts with the preceding verse. The proverb is not concerned about unhappy marriages or bad wives (both of which exist); it simply affirms that when a marriage works out well one should credit it as a gift from God.</p>
<A NAME="1946"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1662><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;causes to fall&#8221; or &#8220;casts&#8221;; NAB &#8220;plunges&#8230;into.&#8221;</p>

Here it refers to lethargy or debility and morbidness. </p>
<A NAME="1948"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1664><b>tn</b> The expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473; &#1512;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿnefesh rÿmiyyah</font>) can be translated &#8220;the soul of deceit&#8221; or &#8220;the soul of slackness.&#8221; There are two identical feminine nouns, one from the verb &#8220;beguile,&#8221; and the other from a cognate Arabic root &#8220;grow loose.&#8221; The second is more likely here in view of the parallelism (cf. NIV &#8220;a shiftless man&#8221;; NAB &#8220;the sluggard&#8221;). One who is slack, that is, idle, will go hungry.</p>
<A NAME="1949"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=1665><b>sn</b> The two lines are related in a metonymical sense: &#8220;deep sleep&#8221; is the cause of going hungry, and &#8220;going hungry&#8221; is the effect of deep sleep. </p>

H. Greenstone has &#8220;The lust of a man is his shame&#8221; (<i>Proverbs</i>, 208). But the sentence is more likely positive in view of the more common uses of the words. &#8220;Man&#8221; could be a genitive of possession or subjective genitive &#8211; the man desires loyal love. It could also be an objective genitive, meaning &#8220;what is desired for a man.&#8221; The first would be the more natural in the proverb, which is showing that loyal love is better than wealth.</p>
<A NAME="1972"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">72</span><note=1688><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;[is] his loyal love&#8221;; NIV &#8220;unfailing love&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;loyalty.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="1974"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">74</span><note=1690><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;the fear of the <sc>Lord.&#8221; This expression features an objective genitive: &#8220;fearing the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="1976"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">76</span><note=1692><b>tn</b> Here &#8220;life&#8221; is probably a metonymy of subject for &#8220;blessings and prosperity in life.&#8221; The plural form often covers a person&#8217;s &#8220;lifetime.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1977"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">77</span><note=1693><b>tn</b> The subject of this verb is probably the one who fears the <sc>Lord and enjoys life. So the proverb uses synthetic parallelism; the second half tells what this life is like &#8211; it is an abiding contentment that is not threatened by calamity (cf. NCV &#8220;unbothered by trouble&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="1978"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">78</span><note=1694><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he will not be visited&#8221; (so KJV, ASV). The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">paqad</font>) is often translated &#8220;visit.&#8221; It describes intervention that will change the destiny. If God &#8220;visits&#8221; it means he intervenes to bless or to curse. To be &#8220;visited by trouble&#8221; means that calamity will interfere with the course of life and change the direction or the destiny. Therefore this is not referring to a minor trouble that one might briefly experience. A life in the <sc>Lord cannot be disrupted by such major catastrophes that would alter one&#8217;s destiny.</p>
<A NAME="1979"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">79</span><note=1695><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;buries&#8221; (so many English versions); KJV &#8220;hideth&#8221;; NAB &#8220;loses.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1980"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">80</span><note=1696><b>sn</b> This humorous portrayal is an exaggeration; but the point is that laziness can overcome hunger. It would have a wider application for anyone who would start a project and then lack the interest or energy to finish it (R. N. Whybray, <i>Proverbs </i>[CBC], 111). Ibn Ezra proposes that the dish was empty, because the sluggard was too lazy to provide for himself. </p>
<A NAME="1981"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">81</span><note=1697><b>tn</b> The Hiphil imperfect <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">takeh</font>) is followed by another imperfect. It could be rendered: &#8220;strike a scorner [imperfect of instruction] and a simpleton will become prudent.&#8221; But the first of the parallel verbs can also be subordinated to the second as a temporal or conditional clause. Some English versions translate &#8220;beat&#8221; (NAB &#8220;if you beat an arrogant man&#8221;), but this could be understood to refer to competition rather than physical punishment. Therefore &#8220;flog&#8221; has been used in the translation, since it is normally associated with punishment or discipline.</p>
<A NAME="1982"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">82</span><note=1698><b>sn</b> Different people learn differently. There are three types of people in this proverb: the <i>scorner</i> with a closed mind, the <i>simpleton</i> with an empty mind, and the <i>discerning person</i> with an open mind (D. Kidner, <i>Proverbs </i>[TOTC], 135). The simpleton learns by observing a scoffer being punished, even though the punishment will have no effect on the scoffer.</p>
<A NAME="1983"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">83</span><note=1699><b>sn</b> The word is related to &#8220;shrewdness&#8221; (cf. 1:4). The simpleton will learn at least where the traps are and how to avoid them.</p>
<A NAME="1984"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">84</span><note=1700><b>tn</b> The second half begins with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1499;&#1460;&#1497;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hokhiakh</font>), the Hiphil infinitive construct. This parallels the imperfect tense beginning the first half; it forms a temporal or conditional clause as well, so that the main verb is &#8220;he will understand.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The discerning person will learn from verbal rebukes. The contrast is caught in a wordplay in the Midrash: &#8220;For the wise a hint [<i>r&#8217;mizo</i>], for the fool a fist [<i>kurmezo</i>]&#8221; (<i>Mishle</i> 22:6).</p>
<A NAME="1985"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">85</span><note=1701><b>tn</b> The construction joins the Piel participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1462;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿshaded</font>, &#8220;one who robs&#8221;) with the Hiphil imperfect <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yavriakh</font>, &#8220;causes to flee&#8221; = chases away). The imperfect given a progressive imperfect nuance matches the timeless description of the participle as a substantive.</p>
<A NAME="1986"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">86</span><note=1702><b>sn</b> &#8220;Father&#8221; and &#8220;mother&#8221; here represent a stereotypical word pair in the book of Proverbs, rather than describing separate crimes against each individual parent. Both crimes are against both parents.</p>
<A NAME="1987"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">87</span><note=1703><b>tn</b> The more generic &#8220;child&#8221; does not fit the activities described in this verse and so &#8220;son&#8221; is retained in the translation. In the ancient world a &#8220;son&#8221; was more likely than a daughter to behave as stated. Such behavior may reflect the son wanting to take over his father&#8217;s lands prematurely.</p>
<A NAME="1988"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">88</span><note=1704><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Stop listening&#8230;!&#8221; The infinitive construct <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1465;&#1506;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lishmoa</font>&#8217;) functions as the direct object of the imperative: &#8220;stop heeding [or, listening to].&#8221; Of course in this proverb which shows the consequences of doing so, this is irony. The sage is instructing not to stop. The conditional protasis construction does not appear in the Hebrew but is supplied in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="1989"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">89</span><note=1705><b>tn</b> The second line has an infinitive construct <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1490;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lishgot</font>), meaning &#8220;to stray; to go astray; to err.&#8221; It indicates the result of the instruction &#8211; stop listening, and as a result you will go astray. The LXX took it differently: &#8220;A son who ceases to attend to discipline is likely to stray from words of knowledge.&#8221; RSV sees the final clause as the purpose of the instructions to be avoided: &#8220;do not listen to instructions to err.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1990"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">90</span><note=1706><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a witness who is worthless and wicked&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1491; &#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">ed beliyya</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>).

The verb does not seem to fit the line (or the proverb) very well. Some have emended the text to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1506;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yavia</font>&#8217;, &#8220;gushes&#8221;) as in 15:28 (cf. NAB &#8220;pours out&#8221;). Driver followed an Arabic <i>balaga</i> to get &#8220;enunciates,&#8221; which works well with the idea of a false witness (W. McKane, <i>Proverbs </i>[OTL], 529). As it stands, however, the line indicates that in what he says the wicked person accepts evil &#8211; and that could describe a false witness. </p>
<A NAME="1992"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">92</span><note=1708><b>tc</b> Some (cf. NAB) suggest emending the MT&#8217;s &#8220;judgments&#8221; (from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1496;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shafat</font>) to &#8220;rods&#8221; (from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1496;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shavat</font>); however, this is not necessary if the term in the MT is interpreted figuratively. The LXX &#8220;scourges&#8221; might reflect a different <i>Vorlage</i>, but it also could have been an interpretive translation from the same text. &#8220;Judgments&#8221; is a metonymy of cause and refers to the punishment that the scoffer is to receive.</p>
