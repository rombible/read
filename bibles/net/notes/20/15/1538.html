<A NAME="1538"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1264><b>tn</b> The idea expressed in the second colon does not make a strong parallelism with the first with its emphasis on seeking knowledge. Its poetic image of feeding (a hypocatastasis) would signify the acquisition of folly &#8211; the fool has an appetite for it. D. W. Thomas suggests the change of one letter, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;</font> (<i>resh</i>) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;</font> (<i>dalet</i>), to obtain a reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1491;&#1456;&#1506;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yid</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">eh</font>); this he then connects to an Arabic root <i>da`a</i> with the meaning &#8220;sought, demanded&#8221; to form what he thinks is a better parallel (&#8220;Textual and Philological Notes on Some Passages in the Book of Proverbs,&#8221; VTSup 3 [1955]: 285).
