<A NAME="1518"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1244><b>tc</b> The verb of the first colon is difficult because it does not fit the second very well &#8211; a heart does not &#8220;scatter&#8221; or &#8220;spread&#8221; knowledge. On the basis of the LXX, C. H. Toy (<i>Proverbs </i>[ICC], 305) suggests a change to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1510;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yitsÿru</font>, &#8220;they preserve&#8221;). The Greek evidence, however, is not strong. For the second line the LXX has &#8220;hearts of fools are not safe,&#8221; apparently taking <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;&#1470;&#1499;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">-khen</font>) as &#8220;unstable&#8221; instead of &#8220;not so.&#8221; So it seems futile to use the Greek version to modify the first colon to make a better parallel, when the Greek has such a different reading in the second colon anyway.</p>
