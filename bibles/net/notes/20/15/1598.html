<A NAME="1598"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">98</span><note=1324><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[is] instruction of wisdom&#8221; (KJV and NASB similar). The noun translated &#8220;wisdom&#8221; is an attributive genitive: &#8220;wise instruction.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The idea of the first line is similar to Prov 1:7 and 9:10. Here it may mean that the fear of the <sc>Lord results from the discipline of wisdom, just as easily as it may mean that the fear of the <sc>Lord leads to the discipline of wisdom. The second reading harmonizes with the theme in the book that the fear of the <sc>Lord is the starting point.</p>
