<A NAME="1577"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">77</span><note=1303><b>tc</b> The MT simply has &#8220;but pleasant words are pure&#8221; (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;but pure [plural] are the words of pleasantness&#8221;). Some English versions add &#8220;to him&#8221; to make the connection to the first part (cf. NAB, NIV). The LXX has: &#8220;the sayings of the pure are held in honor.&#8221; The Vulgate has: &#8220;pure speech will be confirmed by him as very beautiful.&#8221; The NIV has paraphrased here: &#8220;but those of the pure are pleasing to him.&#8221;</p>
