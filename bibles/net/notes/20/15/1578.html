<A NAME="1578"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">78</span><note=1304><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the one who gains.&#8221; The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1510;&#1461;&#1506;&#1463; &#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">botseakh batsa</font>&#8217;) is a participle followed by its cognate accusative. This refers to a person who is always making the big deal, getting the larger cut, or in a hurry to get rich. The verb, though, makes it clear that the gaining of a profit is by violence and usually unjust, since the root has the idea of &#8220;cut off; break off; gain by violence.&#8221; The line is contrasted with hating bribes, and so the gain in this line may be through bribery.</p>
