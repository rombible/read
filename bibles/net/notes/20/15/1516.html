<A NAME="1516"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1242><b>sn</b> The Hebrew noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1465;&#1505;&#1462;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khosen</font>) means &#8220;wealth; treasure.&#8221; Prosperity is the reward for righteousness. This is true only in so far as a proverb can be carried in its application, allowing for exceptions. The Greek text for this verse has no reference for wealth, but talks about amassing righteousness. </p>
