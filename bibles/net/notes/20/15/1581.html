<A NAME="1581"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">81</span><note=1307><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;gifts&#8221; (so KJV). Gifts can be harmless enough, but in a setting like this the idea is that the &#8220;gift&#8221; is in exchange for some &#8220;profit [or, gain].&#8221; Therefore they are bribes (cf. ASV, NAB, NASB, NIV, NRSV, NLT), and to be hated or rejected. Abram, for example, would not take anything that the king of Sodom had to offer, &#8220;lest [he] say, &#8220;I have made Abram rich&#8221; (Gen 14:22-24).</p>
