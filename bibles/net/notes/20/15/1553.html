<A NAME="1553"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=1279><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;like an overgrowth&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;overgrown with thorns&#8221;; cf. CEV &#8220;like walking in a thorn patch.&#8221; The point of the simile is that the path of life taken by the lazy person has many obstacles that are painful &#8211; it is like trying to break through a hedge of thorns. The LXX has &#8220;strewn with thorns.&#8221;</p>
