<A NAME="1534"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1260><b>tn</b> The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1499;&#1461;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hokheakh</font>) is a Hiphil infinitive absolute. It could function as the object of the verb (cf. NIV, NRSV) or as a finite verb (cf. KJV, NASB, NLT). The latter has been chosen here because of the prepositional phrase following it, although that is not a conclusive argument.</p>
