<A NAME="3133"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=2562><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and she works in the pleasure of her hands.&#8221; The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1461;&#1508;&#1462;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khefets</font>) means &#8220;delight; pleasure.&#8221; BDB suggests it means here &#8220;that in which one takes pleasure,&#8221; i.e., a business, and translates the line &#8220;in the business of her hands&#8221; (BDB 343 s.v. 4). But that translation reduces the emphasis on pleasure and could have easily been expressed in other ways. Here it is part of the construct relationship. The &#8220;hands&#8221; are the metonymy of cause, representing all her skills and activities in making things. It is also a genitive of specification, making &#8220;pleasure&#8221; the modifier of &#8220;her hands/her working.&#8221; She does her work with pleasure. <i>Tg</i>. Prov 31:13 has, &#8220;she works with her hands in accordance with her pleasure.&#8221;</p>
