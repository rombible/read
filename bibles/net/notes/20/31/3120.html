<A NAME="3120"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2549><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;of all the defenseless.&#8221; The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1458;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khalof</font>) means &#8220;passing away; vanishing&#8221; (properly an infinitive); in this construction &#8220;the sons of the passing away&#8221; means people who by nature are transitory, people who are dying &#8211; mortals. But in this context it would indicate people who are &#8220;defenseless&#8221; as opposed to those who are healthy and powerful.</p>
