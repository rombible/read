<A NAME="3152"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=2581><b>tn</b> The first word of the thirteenth line begins with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;</font> (<i>mem</i>), the thirteenth letter of the Hebrew alphabet. The word rendered &#8220;coverlets&#8221; appears in 7:16, where it has the idea of &#8220;covered.&#8221; K&amp;D 17:335 suggests &#8220;pillows&#8221; or &#8220;mattresses&#8221; here. The Greek version has &#8220;lined overcoats&#8221; or &#8220;garments,&#8221; but brings over the last word of the previous verse to form this line and parallel the second half, which has clothing in view.</p>
