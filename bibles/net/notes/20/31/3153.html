<A NAME="3153"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=2582><b>sn</b> The &#8220;fine linen&#8221; refers to expensive clothing (e.g., Gen 41:42), as does the &#8220;purple&#8221; (e.g., Exod 26:7; 27:9, 18). Garments dyed with purple indicated wealth and high rank (e.g., Song 3:5). The rich man in Luke 16:19 was clothed in fine linen and purple as well. The difference is that the wise woman is charitable, but he is not.</p>
