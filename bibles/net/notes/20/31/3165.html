<A NAME="3165"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=2594><b>tn</b> The Hebrew phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1463;&#1514;&#1470;&#1495;&#1462;&#1505;&#1462;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">torat-khesed</font>) is open to different interpretations. (1) The word &#8220;law&#8221; could here refer to &#8220;teaching&#8221; as it does frequently in the book of Proverbs, and the word &#8220;love,&#8221; which means &#8220;loyal, covenant love,&#8221; could have the emphasis on faithfulness, yielding the idea of &#8220;faithful teaching&#8221; to parallel &#8220;wisdom&#8221; (cf. NIV). (2) The word &#8220;love&#8221; should probably have more of the emphasis on its basic meaning of &#8220;loyal love, lovingkindness.&#8221; It also would be an attributive genitive, but its force would be that of &#8220;loving instruction&#8221; or &#8220;teaching with kindness.&#8221;</p>
