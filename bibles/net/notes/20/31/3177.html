<A NAME="3177"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">77</span><note=2606><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Give her from the fruit of her hands.&#8221; The expression &#8220;the fruit of her hands&#8221; employs two figures. The word &#8220;fruit&#8221; is a figure known as hypocatastasis, an implied comparison, meaning &#8220;what she produces.&#8221; The word &#8220;hand&#8221; is a metonymy of cause, meaning her efforts to produce things. So the line is saying essentially &#8220;give her her due.&#8221; This would either mean give her credit for what she has done (the option followed by the present translation; cf. TEV) or reward her for what she has done (cf. NAB, NIV, NLT).</p>
