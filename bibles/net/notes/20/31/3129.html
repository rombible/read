<A NAME="3129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2558><b>sn</b> The Hebrew word used here for &#8220;gain&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1500;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shalal</font>) is unusual; it means &#8220;plunder; spoil&#8221; of war primarily (e.g., Isa 8:1-4 and the name Maher-<i>Shalal</i>-Hash-Baz). The point is that the gain will be as rich and bountiful as the spoils of war. The wife&#8217;s capabilities in business and domestic matters guarantee a rich profit and inspire the confidence of her husband.</p>
