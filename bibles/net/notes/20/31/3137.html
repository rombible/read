<A NAME="3137"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=2566><b>sn</b> The word for &#8220;food&#8221; is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">teref</font>, &#8220;prey&#8221;; KJV &#8220;meat&#8221;), another word that does not normally fit the domestic scene. This word also is used in a similar way in Ps 111:5, which says the <sc>Lord gives food. Here it is the noble woman who gives food to her family and servants.</p>
