<A NAME="3151"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=2580><b>tn</b> For the MT&#8217;s &#8220;scarlet&#8221; the LXX and the Latin have &#8220;two&#8221; or &#8220;double&#8221; &#8211; the difference being essentially the vocalization of a plural as opposed to a dual. The word is taken in the versions with the word that follows (&#8220;covers&#8221;) to means &#8220;double garments.&#8221; The question to be asked is whether scarlet would keep one warm in winter or double garments. The latter is the easier reading and therefore suspect. </p>
