<A NAME="314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2533><b>tn</b> In all three occurrences in this verse the word &#8220;son&#8221; has the Aramaic spelling, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1463;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bar</font>), rather than the Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ben</font>). The repetition of the word &#8220;son&#8221; shows the seriousness of the warning; and the expression &#8220;son of my womb&#8221; and &#8220;son of my vows&#8221; are endearing epithets to show the great investment she has made in his religious place in God&#8217;s program. For a view that &#8220;son of my womb&#8221; should be &#8220;my own son,&#8221; see F. Deist, &#8220;Proverbs 31:1, A Case of Constant Mistranslation,&#8221; <i>JNSL</i> 6 (1978): 1-3; cf. TEV &#8220;my own dear son.&#8221;</p>
