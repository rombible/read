<A NAME="3174"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">74</span><note=2603><b>sn</b> The verse shows that &#8220;charm&#8221; and &#8220;beauty&#8221; do not endure as do those qualities that the fear of the <sc>Lord produces. Charm is deceitful: One may be disappointed in the character of the one with beauty. Beauty is vain (fleeting as a vapor): Physical appearance will not last. The writer is not saying these are worthless; he is saying there is something infinitely more valuable. </p>
