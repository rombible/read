<A NAME="315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2534><b>sn</b> The word translated &#8220;strength&#8221; refers to physical powers here, i.e., &#8220;vigor&#8221; (so NAB) or &#8220;stamina.&#8221; It is therefore a metonymy of cause; the effect would be what spending this strength meant &#8211; sexual involvement with women. It would be easy for a king to spend his energy enjoying women, but that would be unwise.</p>
