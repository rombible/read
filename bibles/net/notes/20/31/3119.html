<A NAME="3119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2548><b>sn</b> The instruction compares people who cannot defend themselves in court with those who are physically unable to speak (this is a figure of speech known as hypocatastasis, an implied comparison). The former can physically speak; but because they are the poor, the uneducated, the oppressed, they are unable to conduct a legal defense. They may as well be speechless.</p>
