<A NAME="3122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2551><b>sn</b> Previously the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">din</font>, judgment&#8221;) was used, signifying the legal rights or the pleas of the people. Now the imperative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font> is used. It could be translated &#8220;judge,&#8221; but in this context &#8220;judge the poor&#8221; could be misunderstood to mean &#8220;condemn.&#8221; Here advocacy is in view, and so &#8220;plead the cause&#8221; is a better translation (cf. NASB, NIV, NRSV &#8220;defend the rights&#8221;). It was &#8211; and is &#8211; the responsibility of the king (ruler) to champion the rights of the poor and needy, who otherwise would be ignored and oppressed. They are the ones left destitute by the cruelties and inequalities of life (e.g., 2 Sam 14:4-11; 1 Kgs 3:16-28; Pss 45:3-5, 72:4; Isa 9:6-7).</p>
