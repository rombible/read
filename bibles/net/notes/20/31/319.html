<A NAME="319"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2538><b>sn</b> This second warning for kings concerns the use of alcohol. If this passage is meant to prohibit any use of alcohol by kings, it would be unheard of in any ancient royal court. What is probably meant is an excessive and unwarranted use of alcohol, or a troubling need for it, so that the meaning is &#8220;to drink wine in excess&#8221; (cf. NLT &#8220;to guzzle wine&#8221;; CEV &#8220;should not get drunk&#8221;). The danger, of course, would be that excessive use of alcohol would cloud the mind and deprive a king of true administrative ability and justice.</p>
