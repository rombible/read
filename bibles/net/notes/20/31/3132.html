<A NAME="3132"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2561><b>tn</b> The first word of the fourth line begins with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;</font> (<i>dalet</i>) the fourth letter of the Hebrew alphabet. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">darash</font>) means &#8220;to seek; to inquire; to investigate.&#8221; The idea is that she looks for the wool and flax to do her work, but the whole verse assumes she has obtained it. This verb also occurs in the hymn of Ps 111, which says in v. 2 that &#8220;the works of the <sc>Lord are <i>searched</i>.&#8221; One word used in another passage is not that significant; but the cumulative effect of words and ideas suggest that the composition of this poem is influenced by hymnology.</p>
