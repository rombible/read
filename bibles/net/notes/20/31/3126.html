<A NAME="3126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2555><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a woman of valor.&#8221; This is the same expression used to describe Ruth (e.g., Ruth 3:11). The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khayil</font>) here means &#8220;moral worth&#8221; (BDB 298 s.v.); cf. KJV &#8220;a virtuous woman.&#8221; Elsewhere the term is used of physical valor in battle, e.g., &#8220;mighty man of valor,&#8221; the land-owning aristocrat who could champion the needs of his people in times of peace or war (e.g., Judg 6:12). Here the title indicates that the woman possesses all the virtues, honor, and strength to do the things that the poem will set forth. </p>
