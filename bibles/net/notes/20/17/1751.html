<A NAME="1751"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=1492><b>tn</b> The verse simply begins with &#8220;letting out water.&#8221; This phrase is a metaphor, but most English versions have made it a simile (supplying &#8220;like&#8221; or &#8220;as&#8221;). R. N. Whybray takes it literally and makes it the subject of the clause: &#8220;stealing water starts a quarrel&#8221; (<i>Proverbs </i>[CBC], 100). However, the verb more likely means &#8220;to let out, set free&#8221; and not &#8220;to steal,&#8221; for which there are clearer words. </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The image involves a small leak in a container or cistern that starts to spurt out water. The problem will get worse if it is not stopped. Strife is like that. </p><p class="footnote"><b>tc</b> The LXX has &#8220;The outpouring of words is the beginning of strife.&#8221; This would make it a warning against thoughtless talk.</p>
