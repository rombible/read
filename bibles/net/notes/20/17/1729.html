<A NAME="1729"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1470><b>sn</b> This &#8220;ruler&#8221; (KJV, NASB &#8220;prince&#8221;; NAB &#8220;noble&#8221;) is a gentleman with a code of honor, to whom truthfulness is second nature (W. McKane, <i>Proverbs </i>[OTL], 507). The word describes one as &#8220;inclined, generous, noble&#8221; (BDB 622 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;</font>). It is cognate to the word for the &#8220;free will offering.&#8221; So for such a noble person lies are not suited. The argument is from the lesser to the greater &#8211; if fools shouldn&#8217;t speak lofty things, then honorable people should not lie (or, lofty people should not speak base things). </p>
