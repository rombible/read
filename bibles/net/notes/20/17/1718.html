<A NAME="1718"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1459><b>sn</b> The parallelism helps define the subject matter: The one who &#8220;mocks the poor&#8221; (NAB, NASB, NIV) is probably one who &#8220;rejoices [NIV gloats] over disaster.&#8221; The poverty is hereby explained as a disaster that came to some. The topic of the parable is the person who mocks others by making fun of their misfortune.</p>
