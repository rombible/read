<A NAME="1758"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=1499><b>sn</b> W. McKane envisions a situation where the fool comes to a sage with a fee in hand, supposing that he can acquire a career as a sage, and this gives rise to the biting comment here: Why does the fool have money in his hands?
