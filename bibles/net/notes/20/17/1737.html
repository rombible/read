<A NAME="1737"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1478><b>sn</b> W. G. Plaut notes that harping on the past has destroyed many friendships and marriages (<i>Proverbs</i>, 188). W. McKane observes that this line refers to the person who breaks up friendships by his scandalous gossip, even if it is done with a kind of zeal for the welfare of the community, for it will destroy love and trust (<i>Proverbs </i>[OTL], 508-9).</p>
