<A NAME="1735"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1476><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;covers&#8221; (so NASB); NIV &#8220;covers over.&#8221; How people respond to the faults of others reveals whether or not they have love. The contrast is between one who &#8220;covers&#8221; (forgives, cf. NCV, NRSV) the fault of a friend and one who repeats news about it. The former promotes love because he cares about the person; the latter divides friends. </p>
