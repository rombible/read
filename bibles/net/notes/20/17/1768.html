<A NAME="1768"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">68</span><note=1509><b>tn</b> The verse parallels two descriptions of the wicked person: &#8220;crooked/perverse of heart&#8221; (genitive of specification), and &#8220;turned away in his tongue&#8221; (deceitful). The first phrase describes twisted intentions. The second, using the Niphal<i> </i>participle (&#8220;one turned away&#8221;) with &#8220;tongue,&#8221; the metonymy of cause, describes one who has turned away from speaking truth. Cf. NLT &#8220;the twisted tongue tumbles into trouble.&#8221;</p>
