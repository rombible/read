<A NAME="1727"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1468><b>sn</b> The &#8220;fool&#8221; proper, described by the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">naval</font>), occurs only here, in v. 21, and in 30:22 in the book. It describes someone who is godless and immoral in an overbearing way (e.g., 1 Sam 25:25; Ps 14:1). A fool should restrain his words lest his foolishness spew out.</p>
