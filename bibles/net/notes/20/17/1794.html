<A NAME="1794"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">94</span><note=1535><b>tn</b> The Niphal participle is used in the declarative/estimative sense with stative verbs: &#8220;to be discerning&#8221; (Qal) becomes &#8220;to be declared discerning&#8221; (Niphal). The proverb is teaching that silence is one evidence of wisdom, and that even a fool can thereby appear wise. D. Kidner says that a fool who takes this advice is no longer a complete fool (<i>Proverbs </i>[TOTC], 127). He does not, of course, become wise &#8211; he just hides his folly. </p>
