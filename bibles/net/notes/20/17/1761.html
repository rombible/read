<A NAME="1761"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=1502><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;is born for adversity.&#8221; This is not referring to sibling rivalry but to the loyalty a brother shows during times of calamity. This is not to say that a brother only shows loyalty when there is trouble, nor that he always does in these times (e.g., 18:19, 24; 19:7; 27:10). The true friend is the same as a brotherly relation &#8211; in times of greatest need the loyal love is displayed.</p>
