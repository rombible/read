<A NAME="1731"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1472><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a stone of favors&#8221;; NAB, NRSV &#8220;a magic stone.&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1495;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shokhad</font>, &#8220;bribe&#8221;) could be simply translated as &#8220;a gift&#8221;; but the second half of the verse says that the one who offers it is successful. At best it could be a gift that opens doors; at worst it is a bribe. The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1495;&#1463;&#1491;</font> is never used of a disinterested gift, so there is always something of the bribe in it (e.g., Ps 15:5; Isa 1:23). Here it is &#8220;a stone that brings favor,&#8221; the genitive being the effect or the result of the gift. In other words, it has magical properties and &#8220;works like a charm.&#8221; </p>
