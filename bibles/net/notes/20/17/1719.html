<A NAME="1719"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1460><b>sn</b> The Hebrew word translated &#8220;insults&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1461;&#1512;&#1461;&#1507;</font>, <font face="Scholar">kheref</font>) means &#8220;reproach; taunt&#8221; (as with a cutting taunt); it describes words that show contempt for or insult God. The idea of reproaching the Creator may be mistaking and blaming God&#8217;s providential control of the world (C. H. Toy, <i>Proverbs</i> [ICC], 337). W. G. Plaut, however, suggests that mocking the poor means holding up their poverty as a personal failure and thus offending their dignity and their divine nature (<i>Proverbs</i>, 187).</p>
