<A NAME="173"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1444><b>tn</b> The house is described as being full of &#8220;sacrifices of strife&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1495;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;</font>, <font face="Scholar">zivkhi-riv</font>). The use of &#8220;sacrifices&#8221; suggests a connection with the temple (as in 7:14) in which the people may have made their sacrifices and had a large amount meat left over. It is also possible that the reference is simply to a sumptuous meal (Deut 12:15; Isa 34:6; Ezek 39:17). It would be rare for Israelites to eat meat apart from festivals, however. In the construction the genitive could be classified as a genitive of effect, the feast in general &#8220;bringing about strife,&#8221; or it could simply be an attributive genitive, &#8220;a feast characterized by strife.&#8221; Abundance often brings deterioration of moral and ethical standards as well as an increase in envy and strife. </p>
