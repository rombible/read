<A NAME="1746"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1487><b>sn</b> The human, who is supposed to be rational and intelligent, in such folly becomes more dangerous than the beast that in this case acts with good reason. As R. L. Alden comments, &#8220;Consider meeting a fool with a knife, or gun, or even behind the wheel of a car&#8221; (<i>Proverbs</i>, 134). See also E. Loewenstamm, &#8220;Remarks on Proverbs 17:12 and 20:27,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 37 (1967): 221-24. For a slightly different nuance cf. TEV &#8220;some fool busy with a stupid project.&#8221;</p>
