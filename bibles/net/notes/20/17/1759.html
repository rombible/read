<A NAME="1759"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=1500><b>sn</b> The verse uses synonymous parallelism, so &#8220;friend&#8221; and &#8220;relative&#8221; are equated. Others, however, will take the verse with antithetical parallelism: W. G. Plaut argues that friendship is a spiritual relationship whereas a brother&#8217;s ties are based on a blood relationship &#8211; often adversity is the only thing that brings brothers together (<i>Proverbs</i>, 189). </p>
