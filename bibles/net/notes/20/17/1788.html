<A NAME="1788"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">88</span><note=1529><b>tn</b> The form is the Hiphil infinitive construct from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1499;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nakhah</font>, &#8220;to strike; to smite&#8221;). It may well refer to public beatings, so &#8220;flog&#8221; is used in the translation, since &#8220;strike&#8221; could refer to an individual&#8217;s action and &#8220;beat&#8221; could be taken to refer to competition.</p>
