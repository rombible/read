<A NAME="1783"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">83</span><note=1524><b>sn</b> To say that &#8220;the eyes of the fool run to the ends of the earth&#8221; means that he has no power to concentrate and cannot focus his attention on anything. The language is hyperbolic. Cf. NCV &#8220;the mind of a fool wanders everywhere.&#8221;</p>
