<A NAME="151"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1227><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;soft answer.&#8221; The adjective <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1468;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rakh</font>, &#8220;soft; tender; gentle&#8221;; BDB 940 s.v.) is more than a mild response; it is conciliatory, an answer that restores good temper and reasonableness (W. McKane, <i>Proverbs</i> [OTL], 477). Gideon illustrates this kind of answer (Judg 8:1-3) that brings peace.</p>
<A NAME="152"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1228><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;word of harshness&#8221;; KJV &#8220;grievous words.&#8221; The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1462;&#1510;&#1462;&#1489;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">etsev</font>, &#8220;pain, hurt&#8221;) functions as an attributive genitive. The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1462;&#1510;&#1462;&#1489;</font> refers to something that causes pain (BDB 780 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1462;&#1510;&#1462;&#1489;</font>). For example, Jephthah&#8217;s harsh answer led to war (Judg 12:1-6).</p>
<A NAME="153"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1229><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;raises anger.&#8221; A common response to painful words is to let one&#8217;s temper flare up.</p>
<A NAME="154"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1230><b>sn</b> The contrast is between the &#8220;tongue of the wise&#8221; and the &#8220;mouth of the fool.&#8221; Both expressions are metonymies of cause; the subject matter is what they say. How wise people are can be determined from what they say.</p>
<A NAME="155"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1231><b>tn</b> <i>Or</i> &#8220;makes knowledge acceptable&#8221; (so NASB). The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1496;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tetiv</font>, Hiphil imperfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1496;&#1463;&#1489;</font> [<font face="Scholar">yatav</font>, &#8220;to be good&#8221;]) can be translated &#8220;to make good&#8221; or &#8220;to treat in a good [or, excellent] way&#8221; (C. H. Toy, <i>Proverbs</i> [ICC], 303). M. Dahood, however, suggests emending the text to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1496;&#1460;&#1497;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tetif</font>) which is a cognate of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1496;&#1463;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nataf</font>, &#8220;drip&#8221;), and translates &#8220;tongues of the sages drip with knowledge&#8221; (<i>Proverbs and Northwest Semitic Philology</i>, 32-33). But this change is gratuitous and unnecessary.</p>
<A NAME="156"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1232><b>sn</b> The Hiphil<i> </i>verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1506;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yabia</font>&#8217;) means &#8220;to pour out; to emit; to cause to bubble; to belch forth.&#8221; The fool bursts out with reckless utterances (cf. TEV &#8220;spout nonsense&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="157"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1233><b>sn</b> The proverb uses anthropomorphic language to describe God&#8217;s exacting and evaluating knowledge of all people.</p>
<A NAME="158"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1234><b>tn</b> The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1465;&#1508;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsofot</font>, &#8220;watching&#8221;) is a feminine plural participle agreeing with &#8220;eyes.&#8221; God&#8217;s watching eyes comfort good people but convict evil.</p>
<A NAME="159"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1235><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;a tongue.&#8221; The term &#8220;tongue&#8221; is a metonymy of cause for what is produced: speech.</p>
<A NAME="1510"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1236><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a tongue of healing.&#8221; A healing tongue refers to speech that is therapeutic or soothing. It is a source of vitality.</p>
<A NAME="1511"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1237><b>tn</b> The comparative &#8220;like&#8221; does not appear in the Hebrew text, but is implied by the metaphor; it is supplied for the sake of clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1512"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1238><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;tree of life.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1513"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1239><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;perversion in it.&#8221; The referent must be the tongue, so this has been supplied in the translation for clarity. A tongue that is twisted, perverse, or deceitful is a way of describing deceitful speech. Such words will crush the spirit (e.g., Isa 65:14).</p>
<A NAME="1514"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1240><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;is prudent&#8221; (so KJV, NASB, NRSV); NCV, NLT &#8220;is wise.&#8221; Anyone who accepts correction or rebuke will become prudent in life.</p>
<A NAME="1515"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1241><b>tn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bet</font>, &#8220;house&#8221;) functions as an adverbial accusative of location.</p>
<A NAME="1516"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1242><b>sn</b> The Hebrew noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1465;&#1505;&#1462;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khosen</font>) means &#8220;wealth; treasure.&#8221; Prosperity is the reward for righteousness. This is true only in so far as a proverb can be carried in its application, allowing for exceptions. The Greek text for this verse has no reference for wealth, but talks about amassing righteousness. </p>
<A NAME="1517"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1243><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;will be troubled.&#8221; The function of the Niphal participle may be understood in two ways: (1) substantival use: abstract noun meaning &#8220;disturbance, calamity&#8221; (BDB 747 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1512;</font>) or passive noun meaning &#8220;thing troubled,&#8221; or (2) verbal use: &#8220;will be troubled&#8221; (<i>HALOT </i>824 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1499;&#1512;</font> nif). </p>
<A NAME="1518"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1244><b>tc</b> The verb of the first colon is difficult because it does not fit the second very well &#8211; a heart does not &#8220;scatter&#8221; or &#8220;spread&#8221; knowledge. On the basis of the LXX, C. H. Toy (<i>Proverbs </i>[ICC], 305) suggests a change to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1510;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yitsÿru</font>, &#8220;they preserve&#8221;). The Greek evidence, however, is not strong. For the second line the LXX has &#8220;hearts of fools are not safe,&#8221; apparently taking <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;&#1470;&#1499;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">-khen</font>) as &#8220;unstable&#8221; instead of &#8220;not so.&#8221; So it seems futile to use the Greek version to modify the first colon to make a better parallel, when the Greek has such a different reading in the second colon anyway.</p>
<A NAME="1519"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1245><b>sn</b> The phrase &#8220;the heart of fools&#8221; emphasizes that fools do not comprehend knowledge. Cf. NCV &#8220;there is no knowledge in the thoughts of fools.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1520"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1246><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;an abomination of the <sc>Lord.&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿhvah</font>, &#8220;the <sc>Lord&#8221;) functions as a subjective genitive: &#8220;the <sc>Lord abhors.&#8221; Cf. NIV &#8220;the Lord detests&#8221;; NCV, NLT &#8220;the Lord hates&#8221;; CEV &#8220;the Lord is disgusted.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1521"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1247><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;sacrifice&#8221; (so many English versions). </p>
<A NAME="1522"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1248><b>sn</b> The <i>sacrifices of the wicked</i> are hated by the <sc>Lord because the worshipers are insincere and blasphemous (e.g., Prov 15:29; 21:3; 28:9; Ps 40:6-8; Isa 1:10-17). In other words, the spiritual condition of the worshiper determines whether or not the worship is acceptable to God.</p>
<A NAME="1523"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1249><b>sn</b> J. H. Greenstone notes that if God will accept the prayers of the upright, he will accept their sacrifices; for sacrifice is an outer ritual and easily performed even by the wicked, but prayer is a private and inward act and not usually fabricated by unbelievers (<i>Proverbs</i>, 162). </p>
<A NAME="1524"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1250><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[is] his pleasure.&#8221; The 3rd person masculine singular suffix functions as a subjective genitive: &#8220;he is pleased.&#8221; God is pleased with the prayers of the upright.</p>
<A NAME="1525"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1251><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;an abomination of the <sc>Lord.&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿhvah</font>, &#8220;the <sc>Lord&#8221;) functions as a subjective genitive: &#8220;the <sc>Lord abhors.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1526"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1252><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the one who&#8221; (so NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="1527"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1253><b>sn</b> God hates <i>the way of the wicked</i>, that is, their lifestyle and things they do. God loves <i>those who pursue righteousness</i>, the Piel verb signifying a persistent pursuit. W. G. Plaut says, &#8220;He who loves God will be moved to an active, persistent, and even dangerous search for justice&#8221; (<i>Proverbs</i>, 170).</p>
<A NAME="1528"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1254><b>tn</b> The two lines are parallel synonymously, so the &#8220;severe discipline&#8221; of the first colon is parallel to &#8220;will die&#8221; of the second. The expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1464;&#1512; &#1512;&#1464;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">musar ra</font>&#8217;, &#8220;severe discipline&#8221;) indicates a discipline that is catastrophic or harmful to life.</p>
<A NAME="1529"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1255><b>sn</b> If this line and the previous line are synonymous, then the <i>one who abandons the way</i> also refuses any correction, and so there is severe punishment. To abandon the way means to leave the life of righteousness which is the repeated subject of the book of Proverbs.</p>
<A NAME="1530"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1256><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;Sheol and Abaddon&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500; &#1493;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1489;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ol va</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adon</font>); so ASV, NASB, NRSV; cf. KJV &#8220;Hell and destruction&#8221;; NAB &#8220;the nether world and the abyss.&#8221; These terms represent the remote underworld and all the mighty powers that reside there (e.g., Prov 27:20; Job 26:6; Ps 139:8; Amos 9:2; Rev 9:11). The <sc>Lord knows everything about this remote region.</p>
<A NAME="1531"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1257><b>tn</b> The construction <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1507; &#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">af ki</font>, &#8220;how much more!&#8221;) introduces an argument from the lesser to the greater: If all this is open before the <sc>Lord, how much more so human hearts. &#8220;Hearts&#8221; here is a metonymy of subject, meaning the motives and thoughts (cf. NCV &#8220;the thoughts of the living&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="1532"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1258><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the hearts of the sons of man,&#8221; although here &#8220;sons of man&#8221; simply means &#8220;men&#8221; or &#8220;human beings.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="1533"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1259><b>sn</b> This is an understatement, the opposite being intended (a figure called tapeinosis). A scorner rejects any efforts to reform him.</p>
<A NAME="1534"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1260><b>tn</b> The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1499;&#1461;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hokheakh</font>) is a Hiphil infinitive absolute. It could function as the object of the verb (cf. NIV, NRSV) or as a finite verb (cf. KJV, NASB, NLT). The latter has been chosen here because of the prepositional phrase following it, although that is not a conclusive argument.</p>
<A NAME="1535"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1261><b>tc</b> The MT has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font>, &#8220;to [the wise]&#8221;), suggesting seeking the advice of the wise. The LXX, however, has &#8220;with the wise,&#8221; suggesting <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et</font>).</p>
<A NAME="1536"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1262><b>tn</b> The contrast in this proverb is between the &#8220;joyful heart&#8221; (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;a heart of joy,&#8221; using an attributive genitive) and the &#8220;painful heart&#8221; (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;pain of the heart,&#8221; using a genitive of specification).</p>
<A NAME="1537"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1263><b>sn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1461;&#1497;&#1496;&#1460;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yetiv</font>) normally means &#8220;to make good,&#8221; but here &#8220;to make the face good,&#8221; that is, there is a healthy, favorable, uplifted expression. The antithesis is the pained heart that crushes the spirit. C. H. Toy observes that a broken spirit is expressed by a sad face, while a cheerful face shows a courageous spirit (<i>Proverbs </i>[ICC], 308).</p>
<A NAME="1538"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1264><b>tn</b> The idea expressed in the second colon does not make a strong parallelism with the first with its emphasis on seeking knowledge. Its poetic image of feeding (a hypocatastasis) would signify the acquisition of folly &#8211; the fool has an appetite for it. D. W. Thomas suggests the change of one letter, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;</font> (<i>resh</i>) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;</font> (<i>dalet</i>), to obtain a reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1491;&#1456;&#1506;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yid</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">eh</font>); this he then connects to an Arabic root <i>da`a</i> with the meaning &#8220;sought, demanded&#8221; to form what he thinks is a better parallel (&#8220;Textual and Philological Notes on Some Passages in the Book of Proverbs,&#8221; VTSup 3 [1955]: 285). But even though the parallelism is not as precise as some would prefer, there is insufficient warrant for such a change.</p>
<A NAME="1539"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1265><b>sn</b> The &#8220;days&#8221; represent what happens on those days (metonymy of subject).</p>
<A NAME="1540"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1266><b>tn</b> The contrast is between the &#8220;afflicted&#8221; and the &#8220;good of heart&#8221; (a genitive of specification, &#8220;cheerful/healthy heart/spirit/attitude&#8221;). </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The parallelism suggests that the <i>afflicted</i> is one afflicted within his spirit, for the proverb is promoting a healthy frame of mind.</p>
<A NAME="1541"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1267><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;evil&#8221;; or &#8220;catastrophic.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1542"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1268><b>tn</b> &#8220;one with&#8221; is supplied.</p>
<A NAME="1543"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1269><b>sn</b> The image of a <i>continual feast</i> signifies the enjoyment of what life offers (cf. TEV &#8220;happy people&#8230;enjoy life&#8221;). The figure is a hypocatastasis; among its several implications are joy, fulfillment, abundance, pleasure.</p>
<A NAME="1544"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1270><b>sn</b> One of the frequent characteristics of wisdom literature is the &#8220;better&#8221; saying; it is a comparison of different but similar things to determine which is to be preferred. These two verses focus on spiritual things being better than troubled material things.</p>
<A NAME="1545"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1271><b>sn</b> <i>Turmoil</i> refers to anxiety; the fear of the <sc>Lord alleviates anxiety, for it brings with it contentment and confidence.</p>
<A NAME="1546"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1272><b>sn</b> Not all wealth has turmoil with it. But the proverb is focusing on the comparison of two things &#8211; fear of the <sc>Lord with little and wealth with turmoil. Between these two, the former is definitely better.</p>
<A NAME="1547"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1273><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and love there.&#8221; This clause is a circumstantial clause introduced with <i>vav</i>, that becomes<i> </i>&#8220;where there is love.&#8221; The same construction is used in the second colon.</p>
<A NAME="1548"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1274><b>sn</b> Again the saying concerns troublesome wealth: Loving relationships with simple food are better than a feast where there is hatred. The ideal, of course, would be loving family and friends with a great meal in addition, but this proverb is only comparing two things.</p>
<A NAME="1549"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=1275><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a man of wrath&#8221;; KJV, ASV &#8220;a wrathful man.&#8221; The term &#8220;wrath&#8221; functions as an attributive genitive: &#8220;an angry person.&#8221; He is contrasted with the &#8220;slow of anger,&#8221; so he is a &#8220;quick-tempered person&#8221; (cf. NLT &#8220;a hothead&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="1550"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=1276><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;slow of anger.&#8221; The noun &#8220;anger&#8221; functions as a genitive of specification: slow in reference to anger, that is, slow to get angry, patient.</p>
<A NAME="1551"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=1277><b>tn</b> The Hiphil verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1511;&#1460;&#1497;&#1496;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yashqit</font>) means &#8220;to cause quietness; to pacify; to allay&#8221; the strife or quarrel (cf. NAB &#8220;allays discord&#8221;). This type of person goes out of his way to keep things calm and minimize contention; his opposite thrives on disagreement and dispute.</p>
<A NAME="1552"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=1278><b>sn</b> The fact that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">riv</font>) is used for &#8220;quarrel; strife&#8221; strongly implies that the setting is the courtroom or other legal setting (the gates of the city). The hot-headed person is eager to turn every disagreement into a legal case.</p>
<A NAME="1553"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=1279><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;like an overgrowth&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;overgrown with thorns&#8221;; cf. CEV &#8220;like walking in a thorn patch.&#8221; The point of the simile is that the path of life taken by the lazy person has many obstacles that are painful &#8211; it is like trying to break through a hedge of thorns. The LXX has &#8220;strewn with thorns.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1554"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=1280><b>tn</b> The comparative &#8220;like&#8221; does not appear in the Hebrew text, but is implied by the metaphor; it is supplied for the sake of clarity.</p>

<A NAME="1567"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=1293><b>tn</b> There is disagreement over the meaning of the term translated &#8220;upward.&#8221; The verse is usually taken to mean that &#8220;upward&#8221; is a reference to physical life and well-being (cf. NCV), and &#8220;going down to Sheol&#8221; is a reference to physical death, that is, the grave, because the concept of immortality is said not to appear in the book of Proverbs. The proverb then would mean that the wise live long and healthy lives. But W. McKane argues (correctly) that &#8220;upwards&#8221; in contrast to Sheol, does not fit the ways of describing the worldly pattern of conduct and that it is only intelligible if taken as a reference to immortality (<i>Proverbs</i> [OTL], 480). The translations &#8220;upwards&#8221; and &#8220;downwards&#8221; are not found in the LXX. This has led some commentators to speculate that these terms were not found in the original, but were added later, after the idea of immortality became prominent.

This refers to a person who is always making the big deal, getting the larger cut, or in a hurry to get rich. The verb, though, makes it clear that the gaining of a profit is by violence and usually unjust, since the root has the idea of &#8220;cut off; break off; gain by violence.&#8221; The line is contrasted with hating bribes, and so the gain in this line may be through bribery.</p>
