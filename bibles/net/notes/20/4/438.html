<A NAME="438"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=384><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the wine of violence&#8221; (so KJV, NAB, NIV, NRSV). This is a genitive of source, meaning that the wine they drink was plundered from their violent crime. The Hebrew is structured in an AB:BA chiasm: &#8220;For they eat the bread of wickedness, and the wine of violence they drink.&#8221; The word order in the translation is reversed for the sake of smoothness and readability.</p>
