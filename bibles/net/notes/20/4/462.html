<A NAME="462"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=408><b>tc</b> The LXX adds, &#8220;For the way of the right hand God knows, but those of the left hand are distorted; and he himself will make straight your paths and guide your goings in peace.&#8221; The ideas presented here are not out of harmony with Proverbs, but the section clearly shows an expansion by the translator. For a brief discussion of whether this addition is Jewish or early Christian, see C. H. Toy, <i>Proverbs</i> (ICC), 99. </p>
