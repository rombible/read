<A NAME="171"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1442><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;a dry piece of bread&#8221; is like bread without butter, a morsel of bread not dipped in vinegar mix (e.g., Ruth 2:14). It represents here a simple, humble meal. </p>
<A NAME="172"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1443><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and quietness in it&#8221;; the construction functions as a circumstantial clause: &#8220;in which there is quietness&#8221; or &#8220;with quietness.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The Hebrew word means &#8220;quietness&#8221; or &#8220;ease.&#8221; It represents a place where there can be carefree ease because of the sense of peace and security. The Greek rendering suggests that those translators read it as &#8220;peace.&#8221; Even if the fare is poor, this kind of setting is to be preferred.</p>
<A NAME="173"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1444><b>tn</b> The house is described as being full of &#8220;sacrifices of strife&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1495;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;</font>, <font face="Scholar">zivkhi-riv</font>). The use of &#8220;sacrifices&#8221; suggests a connection with the temple (as in 7:14) in which the people may have made their sacrifices and had a large amount meat left over. It is also possible that the reference is simply to a sumptuous meal (Deut 12:15; Isa 34:6; Ezek 39:17). It would be rare for Israelites to eat meat apart from festivals, however. In the construction the genitive could be classified as a genitive of effect, the feast in general &#8220;bringing about strife,&#8221; or it could simply be an attributive genitive, &#8220;a feast characterized by strife.&#8221; Abundance often brings deterioration of moral and ethical standards as well as an increase in envy and strife. </p>
<A NAME="174"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1445><b>sn</b> The setting is in the ancient world where a servant rarely advanced beyond his or her station in life. But there are notable exceptions (e.g., Gen 15:3 where the possibility is mentioned, 1 Chr 2:35 where it changed through marriage, and 2 Sam 16:1-4; 19:24-30, with the story of Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth). This proverb focuses on a servant who is wise, one who uses all his abilities effectively &#8211; a Joseph figure.</p>
<A NAME="175"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1446><b>sn</b> The parallelism indicates that &#8220;ruling over&#8221; and &#8220;sharing in the inheritance&#8221; means that the disgraceful son will be disinherited.</p>
<A NAME="176"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1447><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;son.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="177"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1448><b>tn</b> The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mevish</font>) is a Hiphil participle, modifying <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ben</font>). This original heir would then be one who caused shame or disgrace to the family, probably by showing a complete lack of wisdom in the choices he made.</p>
<A NAME="178"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1449><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the midst of the brothers&#8221;; NIV &#8220;as one of the brothers.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="179"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1450><b>sn</b> The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1510;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">matsref</font>) means &#8220;a place or instrument for refining&#8221; (cf. ASV, NASB &#8220;the refining pot&#8221;). The related verb, which means &#8220;to melt, refine, smelt,&#8221; is used in scripture literally for refining and figuratively for the <sc>Lord&#8217;s purifying and cleansing and testing people.</p>
<A NAME="1710"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1451><b>tn</b> The term &#8220;refining&#8221; does not appear in the Hebrew text, but is implied by the parallelism; it is supplied in the translation for the sake of clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1711"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1452><b>sn</b> The term <b><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font></b> (<font face="Scholar">cur</font>) describes a &#8220;furnace&#8221; or &#8220;smelting pot.&#8221; It can be used figuratively for the beneficial side of affliction (Isa 48:10).</p>
<A NAME="1712"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1453><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and.&#8221; Most English versions treat this as an adversative (&#8220;but&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="1713"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1454><b>sn</b> The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1465;&#1495;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bokhen</font>, &#8220;tests&#8221;) in this emblematic parallelism takes on the connotations of the crucible and the furnace. When the <sc>Lord &#8220;tests&#8221; human hearts, the test, whatever form it takes, is designed to improve the value of the one being tested. Evil and folly will be removed when such testing takes place.</p>
<A NAME="1714"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1455><b>tn</b> The Hiphil participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1512;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mera</font>&#8217;) indicates one who is a doer of evil. The line affirms that a person of this nature will eagerly listen to evil talk &#8211; it is part of his nature. </p>
<A NAME="1715"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1456><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;to the lip of evil&#8221;; ASV, NAB, NASB, NRSV &#8220;wicked lips.&#8221; The term &#8220;lip&#8221; is a metonymy of cause for speech (what is said); the term &#8220;evil&#8221; is an attributive genitive. The same will be true in the parallel line where the expression &#8220;to the tongue of destruction&#8221; (NASB &#8220;a destructive tongue&#8221;) means things that are said that destroy others.</p>
<A NAME="1716"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1457><b>tc</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1494;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mezin</font>) is from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zir</font>, &#8220;to feed&#8221;); therefore, the suggested emendation is to take it from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1465;&#1494;&#1462;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ozen</font>, &#8220;ear&#8221;) as a denominative verb, &#8220;to give ear; to listen to.&#8221; Two Hebrew <sc>mss have this variant.</p>
<A NAME="1717"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1458><b>sn</b> Wicked, self-serving people find destructive speech appealing. They should be rebuked and not tolerated (Lev 19:17).</p>
<A NAME="1718"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1459><b>sn</b> The parallelism helps define the subject matter: The one who &#8220;mocks the poor&#8221; (NAB, NASB, NIV) is probably one who &#8220;rejoices [NIV gloats] over disaster.&#8221; The poverty is hereby explained as a disaster that came to some. The topic of the parable is the person who mocks others by making fun of their misfortune.</p>
<A NAME="1719"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1460><b>sn</b> The Hebrew word translated &#8220;insults&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1461;&#1512;&#1461;&#1507;</font>, <font face="Scholar">kheref</font>) means &#8220;reproach; taunt&#8221; (as with a cutting taunt); it describes words that show contempt for or insult God. The idea of reproaching the Creator may be mistaking and blaming God&#8217;s providential control of the world (C. H. Toy, <i>Proverbs</i> [ICC], 337). W. G. Plaut, however, suggests that mocking the poor means holding up their poverty as a personal failure and thus offending their dignity and their divine nature (<i>Proverbs</i>, 187).</p>
<A NAME="1720"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1461><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;children of children [sons of sons].&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1721"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1462><b>tn</b> The comparative &#8220;like&#8221; does not appear in the Hebrew text, but is implied by the metaphor; it is supplied in the translation for the sake of clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1722"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1463><b>sn</b> The metaphor signifies that grandchildren are like a crown, that is, they are the &#8220;crowning glory&#8221; of life. The proverb comes from a culture that places great importance on the family in society and that values its heritage. </p>
<A NAME="1723"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1464><b>tn</b> The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tif</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arat</font>) means &#8220;beauty; glory&#8221; (BDB 802 s.v.). In this passage &#8220;glory&#8221; seems to be identified with &#8220;glorying; boasting&#8221;; so a rendering that children are proud of their parents would be in order. Thus, &#8220;glory of children&#8221; would be a subjective genitive, the glorying that children do.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1724"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1465><b>tc</b> The LXX has inserted: &#8220;To the faithful belongs the whole world of wealth, but to the unfaithful not an obulus.&#8221; It was apparently some popular sentiment at the time.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;their fathers.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1725"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1466><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1462;&#1514;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yeter</font>) could be rendered either &#8220;arrogant&#8221; (cf. NIV) or &#8220;excellent&#8221; (cf. KJV, NASB; NLT &#8220;eloquent&#8221;) because the basic idea of the word is &#8220;remainder; excess,&#8221; from the verb &#8220;be left over.&#8221; It describes &#8220;lofty&#8221; speech (arrogant or excellent) that is not suited for the fool. The Greek version, using <i>pista</i>, seems to support the idea of &#8220;excellent,&#8221; and makes a contrast: &#8220;words that are excellent do not fit a fool.&#8221; The idea of arrogance (NIV) fits if it is taken in the sense of lofty, heightened, or excessive language. </p>
<A NAME="1726"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1467><b>tn</b> &#8220;a lip of excess.&#8221; The term &#8220;lip&#8221; is a metonymy for what is said. </p>
<A NAME="1727"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1468><b>sn</b> The &#8220;fool&#8221; proper, described by the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">naval</font>), occurs only here, in v. 21, and in 30:22 in the book. It describes someone who is godless and immoral in an overbearing way (e.g., 1 Sam 25:25; Ps 14:1). A fool should restrain his words lest his foolishness spew out.</p>
<A NAME="1728"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1469><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;speech of falsehood&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;false speech.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1729"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1470><b>sn</b> This &#8220;ruler&#8221; (KJV, NASB &#8220;prince&#8221;; NAB &#8220;noble&#8221;) is a gentleman with a code of honor, to whom truthfulness is second nature (W. McKane, <i>Proverbs </i>[OTL], 507). The word describes one as &#8220;inclined, generous, noble&#8221; (BDB 622 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;</font>). It is cognate to the word for the &#8220;free will offering.&#8221; So for such a noble person lies are not suited. The argument is from the lesser to the greater &#8211; if fools shouldn&#8217;t speak lofty things, then honorable people should not lie (or, lofty people should not speak base things). </p>
<A NAME="1730"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1471><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;works like&#8221; does not appear in the Hebrew text, but is implied by the metaphor; it is supplied for the sake of clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1731"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1472><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a stone of favors&#8221;; NAB, NRSV &#8220;a magic stone.&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1495;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shokhad</font>, &#8220;bribe&#8221;) could be simply translated as &#8220;a gift&#8221;; but the second half of the verse says that the one who offers it is successful. At best it could be a gift that opens doors; at worst it is a bribe. The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1495;&#1463;&#1491;</font> is never used of a disinterested gift, so there is always something of the bribe in it (e.g., Ps 15:5; Isa 1:23). Here it is &#8220;a stone that brings favor,&#8221; the genitive being the effect or the result of the gift. In other words, it has magical properties and &#8220;works like a charm.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="1732"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1473><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the eyes of its owner.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1733"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1474><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;in all that he turns&#8221;; NASB, NIV &#8220;wherever he turns.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1734"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1475><b>sn</b> As C. H. Toy points out, the sage is merely affirming a point without making a comment &#8211; those who use bribery meet with widespread success (<i>Proverbs</i> [ICC], 341). This does not amount to an endorsement of bribery.</p>
<A NAME="1735"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1476><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;covers&#8221; (so NASB); NIV &#8220;covers over.&#8221; How people respond to the faults of others reveals whether or not they have love. The contrast is between one who &#8220;covers&#8221; (forgives, cf. NCV, NRSV) the fault of a friend and one who repeats news about it. The former promotes love because he cares about the person; the latter divides friends. </p>
<A NAME="1736"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1477><b>sn</b> The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1511;&#1468;&#1461;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿvaqesh</font>) means &#8220;seeks&#8221; in the sense of seeking to secure or procure or promote love. There can be no friendship without such understanding and discretion.</p>
<A NAME="1737"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1478><b>sn</b> W. G. Plaut notes that harping on the past has destroyed many friendships and marriages (<i>Proverbs</i>, 188). W. McKane observes that this line refers to the person who breaks up friendships by his scandalous gossip, even if it is done with a kind of zeal for the welfare of the community, for it will destroy love and trust (<i>Proverbs </i>[OTL], 508-9).</p>
<A NAME="1738"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1479><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;goes in deeper&#8221; (cf. NASB, NRSV). The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1495;&#1461;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nakhet</font>) &#8220;to go down; to descend&#8221; with the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;</font> (<i>bet</i>) means &#8220;to descend into; to make an impression on&#8221; someone.</p>
<A NAME="1739"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1480><b>tn</b> The form is the Hiphil infinitive of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1499;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nakhah</font>) with the comparative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;</font>, <font face="Scholar">min</font>. The word &#8220;fool&#8221; then would be an objective genitive &#8211; more than blows to/on a fool.</p>
<A NAME="1740"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1481><b>sn</b> The proverb is set up in a cause and effect relationship. The cause is that evil people seek rebellion. The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿri</font>) means &#8220;rebellion.&#8221; It is related to the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">marah</font>, &#8220;to be contentious; to be rebellious; to be refractory&#8221;). BDB 598 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;</font> translates the line &#8220;a rebellious man seeketh only evil&#8221; (so NASB).</p>
<A NAME="1741"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1482><b>tn</b> The parallelism seems to be formal, with the idea simply continuing to the second line; the conjunction is therefore translated to reflect this. However, the proverb could be interpreted as antithetical just as easily.</p>
<A NAME="1742"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1483><b>sn</b> Those bent on rebellion will meet with retribution. The messenger could very well be a merciless messenger from the king; but the expression could also figuratively describe something God sends &#8211; storms, pestilence, or any other misfortune.</p>
<A NAME="1743"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1484><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Let a man meet&#8221; (so NASB); NLT &#8220;It is safer to meet.&#8221; The infinitive absolute <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1490;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pagosh</font>, &#8220;to meet&#8221;) functions as a jussive of advice. The bear meeting a man is less dangerous than a fool in his folly. It could be worded as a &#8220;better&#8221; saying, but that formula is not found here. </p>
<A NAME="1744"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1485><b>tn</b> The second colon begins with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>), &#8220;and not.&#8221; This negative usually appears with volitives, so the fuller expression of the parallel line would be &#8220;and let not a fool in his folly [meet someone].&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1745"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1486><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;to meet&#8221; are not in the Hebrew text, but are implied by the parallelism and are supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="1746"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1487><b>sn</b> The human, who is supposed to be rational and intelligent, in such folly becomes more dangerous than the beast that in this case acts with good reason. As R. L. Alden comments, &#8220;Consider meeting a fool with a knife, or gun, or even behind the wheel of a car&#8221; (<i>Proverbs</i>, 134). See also E. Loewenstamm, &#8220;Remarks on Proverbs 17:12 and 20:27,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 37 (1967): 221-24. For a slightly different nuance cf. TEV &#8220;some fool busy with a stupid project.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1747"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1488><b>tn</b> The sentence begins with the participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">meshiv</font>, &#8220;the one who repays&#8221;). The whole first colon may be taken as an independent nominative absolute, with the formal sentence to follow. Some English versions have made the first colon a condition by supplying &#8220;if&#8221; (NAB, NIV, TEV, NLT).</p>
<A NAME="1748"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1489><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mush</font>) means &#8220;to depart; to remove.&#8221; The <i>Kethib</i> is a Hiphil, which would yield a meaning of &#8220;to take away&#8221;; so the <i>Qere</i>, which is the Qal, makes more sense in the line.</p>
<A NAME="1749"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=1490><b>sn</b> The proverb does not explain whether God will turn evil back on him directly or whether people will begin to treat him as he treated others.</p>
<A NAME="1750"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=1491><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the beginning of a quarrel&#8221;; TEV, CEV &#8220;The start of an argument.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1751"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=1492><b>tn</b> The verse simply begins with &#8220;letting out water.&#8221; This phrase is a metaphor, but most English versions have made it a simile (supplying &#8220;like&#8221; or &#8220;as&#8221;). R. N. Whybray takes it literally and makes it the subject of the clause: &#8220;stealing water starts a quarrel&#8221; (<i>Proverbs </i>[CBC], 100). However, the verb more likely means &#8220;to let out, set free&#8221; and not &#8220;to steal,&#8221; for which there are clearer words. </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The image involves a small leak in a container or cistern that starts to spurt out water. The problem will get worse if it is not stopped.
