<A NAME="825"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=636><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1504;&#1461;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sane</font>&#8217;) means &#8220;to hate.&#8221; In this sentence it functions nominally as the predicate. Fearing the <sc>Lord is hating evil.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The verb translated &#8220;hate&#8221; has the basic idea of rejecting something spontaneously. For example, &#8220;Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated&#8221; (Mal 1:2b, 3a). It frequently has the idea of disliking or loathing (as English does), but almost always with an additional aspect of rejection. To &#8220;hate evil&#8221; is not only to dislike it, but to reject it and have nothing to do with it. </p>
