<A NAME="865"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=676><b>tc</b> The <i>Kethib</i> reads plurals: &#8220;those who find me are finders of life&#8221;; this is reflected in the LXX and Syriac. But the <i>Qere</i> is singular: &#8220;whoever finds me finds life.&#8221; The <i>Qere</i> is generally favored as the original reading in such cases as these.</p>
