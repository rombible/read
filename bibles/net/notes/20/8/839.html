<A NAME="839"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=650><b>tn</b> There are two roots <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qanah</font>) in Hebrew, one meaning &#8220;to possess,&#8221; and the other meaning &#8220;to create.&#8221; The earlier English versions did not know of the second root, but suspected in certain places that a meaning like that was necessary (e.g., Gen 4:1; 14:19; Deut 32:6). Ugaritic confirmed that it was indeed another root. The older versions have the translation &#8220;possess&#8221; because otherwise it sounds like God lacked wisdom and therefore created it at the beginning. They wanted to avoid saying that wisdom was not eternal. Arius liked the idea of Christ as the wisdom of God and so chose the translation &#8220;create.&#8221; Athanasius translated it, &#8220;constituted me as the head of creation.&#8221; The verb occurs twelve times in Proverbs with the meaning of &#8220;to acquire&#8221;; but the Greek and the Syriac versions have the meaning &#8220;create.&#8221; Although the idea is that wisdom existed before creation, the parallel ideas in these verses (&#8220;appointed,&#8221; &#8220;given birth&#8221;) argue for the translation of &#8220;create&#8221; or &#8220;establish&#8221; (R. N. Whybray, &#8220;Proverbs 8:22-31 and Its Supposed Prototypes,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 15 [1965]: 504-14; and W. A. Irwin, &#8220;Where Will Wisdom Be Found?&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 80 [1961]: 133-42).</p>
