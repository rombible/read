<A NAME="828"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=639><b>tc</b> In the second half of v. 14 instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ani</font>) the editors propose reading simply <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">li</font>) as the renderings in the LXX, Latin, and Syriac suggest. Then, in place of the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;</font> that comes in the same colon, read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿli</font>). While the MT is a difficult reading, it can be translated as it is. It would be difficult to know exactly what the ancient versions were reading, because their translations could have been derived from either text. They represent an effort to smooth out the text.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;To me [belong] counsel and sound wisdom.&#8221; The second colon in the verse has: &#8220;I, understanding, to me and might.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> In vv. 14-17 the pronouns come first and should receive greater prominence &#8211; although it is not always easy to do this with English.</p>
