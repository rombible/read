<A NAME="830"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=641><b>sn</b> This verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1495;&#1465;&#1511;&#1456;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿkhoqqu</font>) is related to the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1465;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khoq</font>), which is a &#8220;statute; decree.&#8221; The verb is defined as &#8220;to cut in; to inscribe; to decree&#8221; (BDB 349 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1511;</font>). The point the verse is making is that when these potentates decree righteousness, it is by wisdom. History records all too often that these rulers acted as fools and opposed righteousness (cf. Ps 2:1-3). But people in power need wisdom to govern the earth (e.g., Isa 11:1-4 which predicts how Messiah will use wisdom to do this very thing). The point is underscored with the paronomasia in v. 15 with &#8220;kings&#8221; and &#8220;will reign&#8221; from the same root, and then in v. 16 with both &#8220;princes&#8221; and &#8220;rule&#8221; being cognate. The repetition of sounds and meanings strengthens the statements. </p>
