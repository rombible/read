<A NAME="832"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=643><b>tc</b> Many of the MT <sc>mss read &#8220;sovereigns [princes], all the judges of the earth.&#8221; The LXX has &#8220;sovereigns&#8230;rule the earth.&#8221; But the MT manuscript in the text has &#8220;judges of righteousness.&#8221; C. H. Toy suggests that the Hebrew here has assimilated Psalm 148:11 in its construction (<i>Proverbs</i> [ICC], 167). The expression &#8220;judges of the earth&#8221; is what one would expect, but the more difficult and unexpected reading, the one scribes might change, would be &#8220;judges of righteousness.&#8221; If that reading stands, then it would probably be interpreted as using an attributive genitive.</p>
