<A NAME="85"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=616><b>tn</b> The cry is a very loud ringing cry that could not be missed. The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1504;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ranan</font>) means &#8220;to give a ringing cry.&#8221; It is often only a shrill sound that might come with a victory in battle, but its use in the psalms for praise shows that it also can have clear verbal content, as it does here. For wisdom to stand in the street and give such a ringing cry would mean that it could be heard by all. It was a proclamation.</p>
