<A NAME="867"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=678><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the one sinning [against] me.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1496;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khata</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to sin&#8221;) forms a contrast with &#8220;find&#8221; in the previous verse, and so has its basic meaning of &#8220;failing to find, miss.&#8221; So it is talking about the one who misses wisdom, as opposed to the one who finds it.</p>
