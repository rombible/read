<A NAME="2229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1930><b>tn</b> The syntax of the line is somewhat difficult, because &#8220;grace of his lips&#8221; seems to be intruding on the point of the verse with little explanation. Therefore the LXX rendered it &#8220;The Lord loves the pure in heart; all who are blameless in their ways are acceptable to him.&#8221; This has very little correspondence with the Hebrew; nevertheless commentators attempt to reconstruct the verse using it, and the NAB follows the first clause of the LXX here. Some have suggested taking &#8220;king&#8221; as the subject of the whole verse (&#8220;the king loves&#8230;&#8221;), but this is forced.</p>
