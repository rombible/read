<A NAME="2267"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=1968><b>sn</b> Moving a <i>boundary stone</i> was (and still is) a major problem. The boundaries that were established by the forefathers were to be preserved, but no law would stop such violations if people lacked integrity (e.g., Deut 19:14; 27:17; 1 Kgs 21:16-19). Boundaries in Israel were sacred because God owned the land and he apportioned the property to the tribes. To extend one&#8217;s property illegally by moving a neighbor&#8217;s boundary marker was a violation of covenant and oath. Of course, disputes could arise when both sides claim their ancestors established a boundary.</p>
