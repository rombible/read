<A NAME="224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1905><b>tn</b> The form of the verb is the Niphal perfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1490;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pagash</font>); it means &#8220;to meet together [or, each other]&#8221; (cf. KJV, ASV). The point is that rich and poor live side by side in this life, but they are both part of God&#8217;s creation (cf. NAB, NASB &#8220;have a common bond&#8221;). Some commentators have taken this to mean that they should live together <i>because</i> they are part of God&#8217;s creation; but the verb form will not sustain that meaning.</p>
