<A NAME="2253"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=1954><b>tn</b> Older English versions and a few more recent ones render this phrase as either &#8220;excellent things&#8221; following the <i>Qere</i> (so KJV, ASV, NASB, NKJV), &#8220;officers,&#8221; or &#8220;heretofore&#8221; [day before yesterday], following the <i>Kethib</i>. However (as in most recent English versions) the <i>Qere</i> should be rendered &#8220;thirty,&#8221; referring to the number in the collection (cf. NAB, NIV, NRSV, NLT).</p>
