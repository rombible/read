<A NAME="2258"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=1959><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the gate&#8221; (so KJV); NAB, NASB, NRSV &#8220;at the gate.&#8221; The &#8220;gate&#8221; of the city was the center of activity, the place of business as well as the place for settling legal disputes. The language of the next verse suggests a legal setting, so &#8220;court&#8221; is an appropriate translation here. </p>
