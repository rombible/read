<A NAME="2213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1914><b>tc</b> Because MT reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsinnim</font>, &#8220;thorns&#8221;) does not make a very good match with &#8220;traps,&#8221; it has created some difficulty for interpreters. The word &#8220;thorns&#8221; may be obscure, but it is supported by the LXX (&#8220;prickly plants&#8221;) and an apparent cognate &#8220;thorns&#8221; in Num 33:55 and Josh 23:13. But some (including the editors of <i>BHS</i>) suggest changing it to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsammim</font>, &#8220;traps&#8221; changing a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;</font> [<i>nun</i>] to a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;</font> [<i>mem</i>]). But BDB 855 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> acknowledges that this word is a doubtful word, attested only a couple of times in Job (e.g., 18:9). W. McKane traces a development from the idea of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsen</font>, &#8220;basket; trap&#8221;) to support this change (<i>Proverbs </i>[OTL], 565). The present translation (like many other English versions) has retained &#8220;thorns,&#8221; even though the parallelism with &#8220;traps&#8221; is not very good; as the harder reading it is preferred. The variant readings have little textual or philological support, and simplify the line.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> &#8220;Thorns and snares&#8221; represent the dangers and threats to life. They would be implied comparisons (hypocatastasis): As a path strewn with thorns and traps, life for the wicked will be filled with dangers and difficulties.</p>
