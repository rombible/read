<A NAME="227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1908><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;evil,&#8221; a term that is broad enough to include (1) &#8220;sin&#8221; as well as (2) any form of &#8220;danger&#8221; (NIV, NCV, NRSV, NLT) or &#8220;trouble&#8221; (TEV, CEV). The second option is more likely what is meant here: The naive simpleton does not see the danger to be avoided and so suffers for it.</p>
