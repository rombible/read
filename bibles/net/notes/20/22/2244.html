<A NAME="2244"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1945><b>sn</b> A new collection of sayings begins here, forming the fourth section of the book of Proverbs. This collection is not like that of 1:1&#8211;9:18; here the introductory material is more personal than 1:1-7, and the style differs, showing great similarity to the Instruction of Amenemope in Egypt (especially the thirty precepts of the sages in 22:17&#8211;24:22). Verses 17-21 form the introduction, and then the sayings begin in v. 22. After the thirty sayings are given, there are further sayings in 24:23-34. There is much literature on this material: see W. K. Simpson, ed., <i>Literature of Ancient Egypt</i>; <i>ANET</i> 412-425; and A. Cody, &#8220;Notes on Proverbs 22:21 and 22:23b,&#8221; <i>Bib</i> 61 (1980): 418-26.</p>
