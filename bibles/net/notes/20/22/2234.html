<A NAME="2234"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1935><b>tc</b> The LXX changes the phrase to read &#8220;murderers in the street&#8221; to form a better parallelism, possibly because the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ratsakh</font>) is used only of humans, not wild animals. The NIV attempts to solve the problem by making the second line a separate claim by the sluggard: &#8220;or, &#8216;I will be murdered in the streets!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
