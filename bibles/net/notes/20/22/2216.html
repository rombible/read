<A NAME="2216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1917><b>tn</b> The expression in Hebrew is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497; &#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al-pi darko</font>), which can be rendered &#8220;according to his way&#8221;; NEB &#8220;Start a boy on the right road.&#8221; The expression &#8220;his way&#8221; is &#8220;the way he should go&#8221;; it reflects the point the book of Proverbs is making that there is a standard of life to which he must attain. Saadia, a Jewish scholar who lived <sc>a.d. 882-942, first suggested that this could mean the child should be trained according to his inclination or bent of mind. This may have some merit in practice, but it is not likely what the proverb had in mind. In the book of Proverbs there are only two ways that a person can go, the way of the wise or righteousness, and the way of the fool. One takes training, and the other does not. Ralbag, in fact, offered a satirical interpretation: &#8220;Train a child according to his evil inclinations (let him have his will) and he will continue in his evil way throughout life&#8221; (J. H. Greenstone, <i>Proverbs</i>, 234). C. H. Toy says the expression means &#8220;in accordance with the manner of life to which he is destined (<i>Proverbs </i>[ICC], 415). W. McKane says, &#8220;There is only one right way &#8211; the way of life &#8211; and the educational discipline which directs young men along this way is uniform&#8221; (<i>Proverbs </i>[OTL], 564). This phrase does not describe the concept perpetuated by a modern psychological interpretation of the verse: Train a child according to his personality trait.</p>
