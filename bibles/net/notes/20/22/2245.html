<A NAME="2245"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1946><b>sn</b> To &#8220;incline the ear&#8221; means to &#8220;listen carefully&#8221; (cf. NCV); the expression is metonymical in that the ear is the instrument for hearing. It is like telling someone to lean over to hear better.</p>
