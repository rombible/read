<A NAME="223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1904><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;favor of goodness.&#8221; This is a somewhat difficult expression. Some English versions render the phrase &#8220;favor is better than silver or gold&#8221; (so NASB, NRSV) making it parallel to the first colon. But if &#8220;good&#8221; is retained as an attributive modifier, then it would mean one was well thought of, or one had engaging qualities (cf. ASV &#8220;loving favor; NLT &#8220;high esteem&#8221;). This fits with the idea of the reputation in the first colon, for a good name would bring with it the favor of others. </p>
