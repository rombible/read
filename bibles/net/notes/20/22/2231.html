<A NAME="2231"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1932><b>tn</b> There is a slight difficulty in that the abstract noun &#8220;knowledge&#8221; is used nowhere else in the book of Proverbs with the word &#8220;watch.&#8221; C. H. Toy (<i>Proverbs </i>[ICC], 418) wants to make a major change to read &#8220;The eyes of the <sc>Lord are on the righteous,&#8221; but there is no support for this and it reduces the line to a common idea. D. W. Thomas suggests changing the word &#8220;knowledge&#8221; to &#8220;lawsuit&#8221; based on an Arabic cognate (&#8220;A Note on <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;</font> in Proverbs 22:12,&#8221; <i>JTS </i>14 [1963]: 93-94). </p>
