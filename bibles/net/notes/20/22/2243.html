<A NAME="2243"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1944><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;oppressing the poor, it is gain; giving to the rich, it is loss.&#8221; The Hebrew is cryptic, but two sins are mentioned here that will be punished by poverty: extortion and bribery. Perhaps the proverb is simply saying it is easy to oppress the poor for gain, but it is a waste of money to try to buy or bribe a patron (D. Kidner, <i>Proverbs </i>[TOTC], 149).</p>
