<A NAME="2221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1922><b>tc</b> There is a variant reading in the LXX; instead of &#8220;the rod of his wrath&#8221; it reads &#8220;the punishment of his deeds.&#8221; C. H. Toy wishes to emend <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1489;&#1462;&#1496;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shevet</font>) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1489;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shever</font>), &#8220;the produce of his work&#8221; (<i>Proverbs</i> [ICC], 416). But the Hebrew text is not obscure, and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1489;&#1462;&#1512;</font> does not exactly mean &#8220;produce.&#8221; The expression &#8220;rod of his wrath&#8221; may not follow the imagery of 8a very closely, but it is nonetheless understandable. The &#8220;rod&#8221; is a symbol of power; &#8220;wrath&#8221; is a metonymy of cause indicating what wrath will do, and an objective genitive. The expression signifies that in reaping trouble for his sins this person will no longer be able to unleash his fury on others. The LXX adds: &#8220;A man who is cheerful and a giver God blesses&#8221; (e.g., 2 Cor 9:7).</p>
