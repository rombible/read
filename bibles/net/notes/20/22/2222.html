<A NAME="2222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1923><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;good of eye.&#8221; This expression is an attributed genitive meaning &#8220;bountiful of eye&#8221; (cf. KJV, ASV &#8220;He that hath a bountiful eye&#8221;). This is the opposite of the &#8220;evil eye&#8221; which is covetous and wicked. The &#8220;eye&#8221; is a metonymy representing looking well to people&#8217;s needs. So this refers to the generous person (cf. NASB, NIV, NRSV, NLT).</p>
