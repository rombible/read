<A NAME="2214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1915><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1504;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khanakh</font>) means &#8220;to train up; to dedicate&#8221; (BDB 335 s.v.; <i>HALOT </i>334 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1504;&#1498;</font>). The verb is used elsewhere to refer to dedicating a house (Deut 20:5; 1 Kgs 8:63; 2 Chr 7:5). The related noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1458;&#1504;&#1467;&#1499;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khanukhah</font>) means &#8220;dedication; consecration&#8221; (BDB 335 s.v.; <i>HALOT </i>334 s.v.), and is used in reference to the dedication or consecration of altars (Num 7:10; 2 Chr 7:9), the temple (Ps 30:1), and town walls (Neh 12:27). The related adjective <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khanikh</font>) describes &#8220;trained, tried, experienced&#8221; men (BDB 335 s.v.; Gen 14:14). In the related cognate languages the verb has similar meanings: Aramaic &#8220;to train,&#8221; Ethiopic &#8220;to initiate,&#8221; and Arabic IV &#8220;to learn; to make experienced&#8221; (<i>HALOT </i>334 s.v.). This proverb pictures a child who is dedicated by parents to the <sc>Lord and morally trained to follow him. On the other hand, a popular expositional approach suggests that it means &#8220;to motivate.&#8221; This view is based on a cognate Arabic root II which (among many other things) refers to the practice of rubbing the palate of a newborn child with date juice or olive oil to motivate the child to suck. While this makes an interesting sermon illustration, it is highly unlikely that this concept was behind this Hebrew verb. The Arabic meaning is late and secondary &#8211; the Arabic term did not have this meaning until nearly a millennium after this proverb was written.</p>
