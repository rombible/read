<A NAME="231"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1973><b>tn</b> The construction uses the imperfect tense of instruction with the infinitive absolute to emphasize the careful discernment required on such occasions. Cf. NIV &#8220;note well&#8221;; NLT &#8220;pay attention.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1974><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;who,&#8221; referring to the ruler (so ASV, NAB, TEV).</p>
<A NAME="233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1975><b>sn</b> The expression &#8220;put a knife to your throat&#8221; is an idiom that means &#8220;curb your appetite&#8221; or &#8220;control yourself&#8221; (cf. TEV). The instruction was from a time when people dealt with all-powerful tyrants. To enter the presence of such a person and indulge one&#8217;s appetites would be to take a very high risk.</p>
<A NAME="234"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1976><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;lord of appetite.&#8221; The idiom <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500; &#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ba</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al nefesh</font>) refers to someone who possesses a large appetite (cf. NAB &#8220;a ravenous appetite&#8221;). A person with a big appetite is in danger of taking liberties when invited to court.</p>
<A NAME="235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1977><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his&#8221;; the referent (the ruler mentioned in v. 1) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="236"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1978><b>sn</b> The final line gives the causal clause: The impressive feast is not what it appears to be; the king is not doing you a favor, but rather wants something from you or is observing you (K&amp;D 17:104); cf. TEV &#8220;he may be trying to trick you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="237"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1979><b>sn</b> Verses 1-3 form the sixth saying about being cautious before rulers (cf. Instruction of Amememope, chap. 23, 23:13-18). One should not get too familiar with rulers, for they always have ulterior motives. The Mishnah cites Gamaliel as warning that a ruler only draws someone into his court for his purpose, but in their day of trouble he will not be there to help them (<i>m. Abot</i> 2:3).</p>
<A NAME="238"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1980><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from your understanding cease.&#8221; In the context this means that the person should have enough understanding to stop wearing himself out trying to be rich (cf. NRSV &#8220;be wise enough to desist&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="239"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1981><b>tc</b> The <i>Kethib</i> is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1458;&#1514;&#1464;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hata</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">uf</font>), &#8220;do your eyes fly [light] on it?&#8221; The <i>Qere</i> is the Hiphil, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1458;&#1514;&#1464;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hata</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">if</font>) &#8220;do you cause your eyes to fly on it?&#8221; But the line is difficult. The question may be indirect: If you cast your eyes on it, it is gone &#8211; when you think you are close, it slips away.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> The term &#8220;riches&#8221; is not in the Hebrew text, but is supplied in the translation based on the previous verse.</p>
<A NAME="2310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1982><b>sn</b> This seventh saying warns people not to expend all their energy trying to get rich because riches are fleeting (cf. Instruction of Amememope, chap. 7, 9:10-11 which says, &#8220;they have made themselves wings like geese and have flown away to heaven&#8221;). In the ancient world the symbol of birds flying away signified fleeting wealth.</p>
<A NAME="2311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1983><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;an evil eye.&#8221; This is the opposite of the &#8220;good eye&#8221; which meant the generous man. The &#8220;evil eye&#8221; refers to a person who is out to get everything for himself (cf. NASB, NCV, CEV &#8220;selfish&#8221;). He is ill-mannered and inhospitable (e.g., Prov 28:22). He is up to no good &#8211; even though he may appear to be a host.</p>
<A NAME="2312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1984><b>tc</b> The line is difficult; it appears to mean that the miser is the kind of person who has calculated the cost of everything in his mind as he offers the food. The LXX has: &#8220;Eating and drinking with him is as if one should swallow a hair; do not introduce him to your company nor eat bread with him.&#8221; The Hebrew verb &#8220;to calculate&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">sha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ar</font>) with a change of vocalization and of sibilant would yield &#8220;hair&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1461;&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">se</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ar</font>) &#8211; &#8220;like a hair in the throat [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nefesh</font>], so is he.&#8221; This would picture an irritating experience. The Instruction of Amenemope uses &#8220;blocking the throat&#8221; in a similar saying (chapt. 11, 14:7 [<i>ANET</i> 423]). The suggested change is plausible and is followed by NRSV; but the rare verb &#8220;to calculate&#8221; in the MT would be easier to defend on the basis of the canons of textual criticism because it is the more difficult reading.</p>
<A NAME="2313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1985><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;the cost&#8221; does not appear in the Hebrew but is implied by the verb; it is supplied in the translation for the sake of clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1986><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;soul.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1987><b>sn</b> Eating and drinking with a selfish miser would be irritating and disgusting. The line is hyperbolic; the whole experience turns the stomach. </p>
<A NAME="2316"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1988><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;your compliments&#8221; (so NASB, NIV); cf. TEV &#8220;your flattery.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This is the eighth saying; it claims that it would be a mistake to accept hospitality from a stingy person. He is always thinking about the cost, his heart is not in it, and any attempt at pleasant conversation will be lost.</p>
<A NAME="2317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1989><b>sn</b> The mention of &#8220;the ears&#8221; emphasizes the concerted effort to get the person&#8217;s undivided attention. However, a fool rejects instruction and discipline. </p>
<A NAME="2318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1990><b>sn</b> Saying number nine indicates that wisdom is wasted on a fool. The literature of Egypt has no specific parallel to this one.</p>
<A NAME="2319"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1991><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;encroach on&#8221; (NIV, NRSV); <i>Heb</i> &#8220;go into.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2320"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1992><b>tn</b> The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">go</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font>) describes a &#8220;kinsman redeemer.&#8221; Some English versions explicitly cite &#8220;God&#8221; (e.g., NCV, CEV) or &#8220;the Lord&#8221; (e.g. TEV). </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The Hebrew term describes a &#8220;kinsman-redeemer.&#8221; That individual would be a rich or powerful relative who can protect the family; he does this by paying off the debts of a poor relative, buying up the property of a relative who sells himself into slavery, marrying the widow of a deceased relative to keep the inheritance in the family, or taking vengeance on someone who harms a relative, that vengeance often resulting in delivering (&#8220;redeeming&#8221;) the relative from bondage. If there was no human &#8220;kinsman redeemer,&#8221; then the defenseless had to rely on God to perform these actions (e.g., Gen 48:16; Exod 6:6; Job 19:25; Isa 41&#8211;63). In the prophetic literature God is presented as the Redeemer in that he takes vengeance on the enemies (the Babylonians) to deliverer his people (kin). In this proverb the <sc>Lord is probably the Protector of these people who will champion their cause and set things right.</p>
<A NAME="2321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1993><b>sn</b> This is the tenth saying; once again there is a warning not to encroach on other people&#8217;s rights and property, especially the defenseless (see v. 10; 22:22-23, 28).</p>
<A NAME="2322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1994><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;bring.&#8221; The Hiphil imperative &#8220;come; enter&#8221; means &#8220;to apply the heart,&#8221; to use the heart or mind in the process. The same would be true in the second half: &#8220;to bring the ears&#8221; would mean to listen very carefully. Cf. TEV &#8220;Pay attention.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2323"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1995><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;punish&#8221; (NIV). The syntax of these two lines suggests a conditional clause (cf. NCV, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="2324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1996><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his soul.&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nefesh</font>, &#8220;soul&#8221;) functions as a synecdoche of part (= soul) for the whole (= person); see BDB 660 s.v. 4.</p>
<A NAME="2325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1997><b>tn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ol</font>, &#8220;Sheol&#8221;) in this context probably means &#8220;death&#8221; (so NIV, NCV, NLT) and not the realm of the departed (wicked) spirits (cf. NAB &#8220;the nether world&#8221;). In the wisdom of other lands, Ahiqar 6:82 says, &#8220;If I strike you, my son, you will not die.&#8221; The idea is that discipline helps the child to a full life; if the child dies prematurely, it would be more than likely a consequence of not being trained by discipline. In the book of Proverbs the &#8220;death&#8221; mentioned here could be social as well as physical.</p>
<A NAME="2326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1998><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my son,&#8221; although the context does not limit this exhortation to male children.</p>
<A NAME="2327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1999><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my kidneys&#8221;; in biblical Hebrew the term was used for the innermost being, the soul, the central location of the passions. Cf. NASB, NIV &#8220;my inmost being.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2000><b>sn</b> This twelfth saying simply observes that children bring joy to their parents when they demonstrate wisdom. The quatrain is arranged in a chiastic structure (AB:B'A'): The first line (A) speaks of wisdom in the child, and it is paired with the last line (A') which speaks of the child&#8217;s saying what is right. In between these brackets are two lines (B and B') concerning joy to the parent.</p>
<A NAME="2329"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2001><b>tn</b> The verb in this line is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1456;&#1511;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1488;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al-yÿqanne</font>&#8217;), the Piel jussive negated. The verb means &#8220;to be jealous, to be zealous&#8221;; it describes passionate intensity for something. In English, if the object is illegitimate, it is called &#8220;envy&#8221;; if it is correct, it is called &#8220;zeal.&#8221; Here the warning is not to envy the sinners. The second colon could use the verb in the positive sense to mean &#8220;but rather let your passion burn for the fear of the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2330"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2002><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;the fear of the <sc>Lord.&#8221; This expression features an objective genitive: &#8220;fearing the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2003><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;end&#8221; (so KJV); ASV &#8220;a reward.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2332"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2004><b>sn</b> The saying is an understatement; far from being cut off, the &#8220;hope&#8221; will be realized in the end. So this saying, the thirteenth, advises people to be zealous for the fear of the <sc>Lord, their religion, rather than for anything that sinners have to offer.</p>
<A NAME="2333"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=2005><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my son,&#8221; but the immediate context does not limit this to male children.</p>
<A NAME="2334"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=2006><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;do not be among,&#8221; but in the sense of &#8220;associate with&#8221; (TEV); &#8220;join&#8221; (NIV); &#8220;consort&#8230;with&#8221; (NAB).</p>
<A NAME="2335"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=2007><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sava</font>&#8217;) means &#8220;to imbibe; to drink largely.&#8221; The participial construction here, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1465;&#1489;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;&#1497;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sov</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">e-yayin</font>), describes &#8220;drunkards&#8221; (cf. NLT) which is somewhat stronger than saying it refers to &#8220;people who drink too much&#8221; (cf. NIV, TEV).</p>
<A NAME="2336"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=2008><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zalal</font>) means &#8220;to be light; to be worthless; to make light of.&#8221; Making light of something came to mean &#8220;to be lavish with; to squander,&#8221; especially with regard to food. So it describes &#8220;gluttons&#8221; primarily; but in the expression there is also room for the person who wastes a lot of food as well.</p>
<A NAME="2337"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=2009><b>tn</b> Here &#8220;drowsiness&#8221; is a metonymy of effect or adjunct, put for the drunkenness and gluttony that causes it. So all of it, the drunkenness and the drowsiness that comes from it, brings on the ruin (cf. CEV &#8220;you will end up poor&#8221;). Likewise, &#8220;rags&#8221; is a metonymy of adjunct, associated with the poverty brought on by a dissolute lifestyle.</p>
<A NAME="2338"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=2010><b>sn</b> This is the fourteenth saying, warning about poor associations. Drunkenness and gluttony represent the epitome of the lack of discipline. In the Mishnah they are used to measure a stubborn and rebellious son (<i>m. Sanhedrin</i> 8). W. G. Plaut notes that excessive drinking and eating are usually symptoms of deeper problems; we usually focus more on the drinking because it is dangerous to others (<i>Proverbs</i>, 241-42).</p>
<A NAME="2339"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=2011><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;buy&#8221; (so KJV, NASB, NIV, NLT); CEV &#8220;Invest in truth.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The sixteenth saying is an instruction to buy/acquire the kind of life that pleases God and brings joy to parents. &#8220;Getting truth&#8221; would mean getting training in the truth, and getting wisdom and understanding would mean developing the perception and practical knowledge of the truth.</p>
<A NAME="2340"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=2012><b>tc</b> The <i>Qere</i> reading has the imperfect <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1490;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yagil</font>) with the cognate accusative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gil</font>) which intensifies the meaning and the specific future of this verb.</p>
<A NAME="2341"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=2013><b>tn</b> The term &#8220;child&#8221; is supplied for the masculine singular adjective here.</p>
<A NAME="2342"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=2014><b>tn</b> The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1464;&#1490;&#1461;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tagel</font>) is clearly a short form and therefore a jussive (&#8220;may she&#8230;rejoice&#8221;); if this second verb is a jussive, then the parallel <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yismakh</font>) should be a jussive also (&#8220;may your father and your mother have joy&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="2343"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=2015><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my son&#8221;; the reference to a &#8220;son&#8221; is retained in the translation here because in the following lines the advice is to avoid women who are prostitutes.</p>
<A NAME="2344"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=2016><b>tn</b> The comparative &#8220;like&#8221; does not appear in the Hebrew text, but is implied by the metaphor; it is supplied for the sake of clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2345"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=2017><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;foreign woman&#8221; (so ASV). The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1499;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nokhriyyah</font>, &#8220;foreign woman&#8221;) often refers to a prostitute (e.g., Prov 2:6; 5:20; 6:24; 7:5). While not all foreign women in Israel were prostitutes, their prospects for economic survival were meager and many turned to prostitution to earn a living. Some English versions see this term referring to an adulteress as opposed to a prostitute (cf. NAB, NASB, NIV, NRSV, NLT).</p>
<A NAME="2346"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=2018><b>tn</b> The comparative &#8220;like&#8221; does not appear in the Hebrew text, but is implied by the metaphor; it is supplied in the translation for the sake of clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2347"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=2019><b>sn</b> In either case, whether a prostitute or an adulteress wife is involved, the danger is the same. The metaphors of a &#8220;deep pit&#8221; and a &#8220;narrow well&#8221; describe this sin as one that is a trap from which there is no escape. The &#8220;pit&#8221; is a gateway to Sheol, and those who enter are as good as dead, whether socially or through punishment physically.</p>
<A NAME="2348"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=2020><b>tn</b> The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1462;&#1514;&#1462;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khetef</font>) is defined by BDB 369 s.v. as &#8220;prey,&#8221; but this is the only occurrence of the word. The related verb BDB 368-69 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1507;</font> defines as &#8220;to seize; to snatch away&#8221; (with an Aramaic cognate meaning &#8220;to break in pieces&#8221; [<i>Pa</i>], and an Arabic word &#8220;death&#8221;). But the only occurrence of that word is in Job 9:12, where it is defined as &#8220;seizes.&#8221; So in this passage the noun could have either a passive sense (what is seized = prey), or an active sense (the one who seizes = a robber, bandit). The traditional rendering is &#8220;prey&#8221; (KJV); most modern English versions have the active sense (&#8220;robber&#8221; or similar; cf. NIV &#8220;like a bandit&#8221;). Since the prepositional phrase (the simile) is modifying the woman, the active sense works better in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="2349"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=2021><b>tn</b> The participle means &#8220;unfaithful [men]&#8221; (masculine plural); it could also be interpreted as &#8220;unfaithfulness&#8221; in the abstract sense. M. Dahood interprets it to mean &#8220;garments&#8221; (which would have to be repointed), saying that she collects garments in pledge for her service (M. Dahood, &#8220;To Pawn One&#8217;s Cloak,&#8221; <i>Bib</i> 42 [1961]: 359-66). But that is far-fetched; it might have happened on occasion, but as a common custom it is unlikely. Besides that, the text in the MT makes perfectly good sense without such a change. </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Such a woman makes more people prove unfaithful to the law of God through her practice.</p>
<A NAME="2350"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=2022><b>sn</b> Verses 26-28 comprise the seventeenth saying; it warns the young person to follow the instructions about temptations because there are plenty of temptresses lurking about.</p>
<A NAME="2351"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=2023><b>sn</b> The eighteenth saying is about excessive drinking. The style changes here as the sage breaks into a vivid use of the imagination. It begins with a riddle describing the effects of drunkenness (v. 29) and gives the answer in v. 30; instructions follow in v. 31, with the consequences described in v. 32; the direct address continues in vv. 33 and 34; and the whole subject is concluded with the drunkard&#8217;s own words in v. 35 (M. E. Andrews, &#8220;Variety of Expression in Proverbs 23:29-35,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 28 [1978]: 102-3).</p>
<A NAME="2352"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=2024><b>sn</b> The Hebrew word translated &#8220;dullness&#8221; describes darkness or dullness of the eyes due to intoxication, perhaps &#8220;redness&#8221; (so KJV, NASB, NRSV); NIV, NCV, NLT &#8220;bloodshot eyes.&#8221; NAB understands the situation differently: &#8220;black eyes.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2353"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=2025><b>sn</b> The answer to the question posed in v. 29 is obviously one who drinks too much, which this verse uses metonymies to point out. Lingering over wine is an adjunct of drinking more wine; and seeking mixed wine obviously means with the effect or the purpose of drinking it.</p>
<A NAME="2354"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=2026><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;its eye gives.&#8221; With CEV&#8217;s &#8220;bubbling up in the glass&#8221; one might think champagne was in view.</p>
<A NAME="2355"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=2027><b>tn</b> The expression is difficult, and is suspected of having been added from Song 7:10, although the parallel is not exact. The verb is the Hitpael imperfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">halakh</font>); and the prepositional phrase uses the word &#8220;upright; equity; pleasing,&#8221; from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yashar</font>). KJV has &#8220;when it moveth itself aright&#8221;; much more helpful is ASV: &#8220;when it goeth down smoothly.&#8221; Most recent English versions are similar to ASV. The phrase obviously refers to the pleasing nature of wine. </p>
<A NAME="2356"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=2028><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;its end&#8221;; NASB &#8220;At the last&#8221;; TEV (interpretively) &#8220;The next morning.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2357"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=2029><b>tn</b> The feminine plural of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zar</font>, &#8220;strange things&#8221;) refers to the trouble one has in seeing and speaking when drunk.</p>
<A NAME="2358"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=2030><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;heart.&#8221; The idiom here means &#8220;middle&#8221;; KJV &#8220;in the midst.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2359"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=2031><b>sn</b> The point of these similes is to compare being drunk with being seasick. One who tries to sleep when at sea, or even worse, when up on the ropes of the mast, will be tossed back and forth.</p>
<A NAME="2360"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=2032><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;You will say&#8221; is supplied in the translation to make it clear that the drunkard is now speaking.</p>
<A NAME="2361"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=2033><b>sn</b> The line describes how one who is intoxicated does not feel the pain, even though beaten by others. He does not even remember it.</p>
<A NAME="2362"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=2034><b>tn</b> The last line has only &#8220;I will add I will seek it again.&#8221; The use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1505;&#1460;&#1497;&#1507;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">osif</font>) signals a verbal hendiadys with the next verb: &#8220;I will again seek it.&#8221; In this context the suffix on the verb refers to the wine &#8211; the drunkard wants to go and get another drink.</p>
