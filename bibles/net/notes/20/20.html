<A NAME="201"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1709><b>sn</b> The drinks are wine and barley beer (e.g., Lev 10:9; Deut 14:26; Isa 28:7). These terms here could be understood as personifications, but better as metonymies for those who drink wine and beer. The inebriated person mocks and brawls. </p>
<A NAME="202"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1710><b>tn</b> The two participles <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1461;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lets</font>, &#8220;mocker&#8221;) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1465;&#1502;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">homeh</font>, &#8220;brawler&#8221;) are substantives; they function as predicates in the sentence. Excessive use of intoxicants excites the drinker to boisterous behavior and aggressive attitudes &#8211; it turns them into mockers and brawlers.</p>
<A NAME="203"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1711><b>sn</b> The proverb does not prohibit the use of wine or beer; in fact, strong drink was used at festivals and celebrations. But intoxication was considered out of bounds for a member of the covenant community (e.g., 23:20-21, 29-35; 31:4-7). To be led astray by their use is not wise.</p>
<A NAME="204"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1712><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the terror of a king&#8221; (so ASV, NASB); The term &#8220;terror&#8221; is a metonymy of effect for cause: the anger of a king that causes terror among the people. The term &#8220;king&#8221; functions as a possessive genitive: &#8220;a king&#8217;s anger&#8221; (cf. NIV &#8220;A king&#8217;s wrath&#8221;; NLT &#8220;The king&#8217;s fury&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="205"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1713><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mit</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">abbÿro</font>) is problematic; in the MT the form is the Hitpael participle with a pronominal suffix, which is unusual, for the direct object of this verb usually takes a preposition first: &#8220;is angry with.&#8221; The LXX rendered it &#8220;angers [or, irritates].&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="206"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1714><b>sn</b> The expression &#8220;sins against himself&#8221; has been taken by some to mean &#8220;forfeits his life&#8221; (so NAB, NASB, NIV, NRSV) or &#8220;endangers his life&#8221; (cf. NCV, NLT). That may be the implication of getting oneself in trouble with an angry king (cf. TEV &#8220;making him angry is suicide&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="207"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1715><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;man.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="208"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1716><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;cessation&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1489;&#1462;&#1514;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shevet</font>); NAB &#8220;to shun strife&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;refrain from strife.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> One cannot avoid conflict altogether; but the proverb is instructing that at the first sign of conflict the honorable thing to do is to find a way to end it.</p>
<A NAME="209"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1717><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;breaks out.&#8221; The Hitpael of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gala</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to expose; to lay bare&#8221;) means &#8220;to break out; to disclose oneself,&#8221; and so the idea of flaring up in a quarrel is clear. But there are also cognate connections to the idea of &#8220;showing the teeth; snarling&#8221; and so quarreling viciously.</p>
<A NAME="2010"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1718><b>sn</b> The act of plowing is put for the whole process of planting a crop.</p>
<A NAME="2011"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1719><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the autumn&#8221;; ASV &#8220;by reason of the winter.&#8221; The noun means &#8220;autumn, harvest time.&#8221; The right time for planting was after the harvest and the rainy season of autumn and winter began.</p>
<A NAME="2012"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1720><b>tn</b> The Piel of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>, &#8220;to ask&#8221;) means &#8220;to beg&#8221; or &#8220;to inquire carefully.&#8221; At the harvest time he looks for produce but there is none. The Piel might suggest, however, that because he did not plant, or did not do it at the right time, he is reduced to begging and will have nothing (cf. KJV, ASV; NASB &#8220;he begs during the harvest&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="2013"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1721><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;for the crop&#8221; does not appear in the Hebrew but is implied; it is supplied in the translation for the sake of clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2014"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1722><b>sn</b> The noun means &#8220;advice, counsel&#8221;; it can have the connotation of planning or making decisions. Those with understanding can sort out plans.</p>
<A NAME="2015"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1723><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the heart of a man&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;in the human mind.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2016"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1724><b>tn</b> The comparative &#8220;like&#8221; does not appear in the Hebrew text, but is implied by the metaphor; it is supplied for the sake of clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2017"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1725><b>sn</b> The motives or plans of a person are &#8220;difficult to fathom&#8221;; it takes someone with understanding to discover and surface them (the verb in the last colon continues the figure with the sense of bringing the plans to the surface and sorting them out).</p>
<A NAME="2018"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1726><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a man of understanding&#8221;; TEV &#8220;someone with insight&#8221;; NLT &#8220;the wise.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2019"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1727><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;many a man calls/proclaims a man of his loyal love.&#8221; The Syriac and <i>Tg</i>. Prov 20:6 render the verb as passive: &#8220;many are called kind.&#8221; Other suggestions include: &#8220;most men meet people who will do them occasional kindnesses&#8221; (RSV); &#8220;many men profess friendship&#8221; (C. H. Toy, <i>Proverbs</i> [ICC], 384); &#8220;many men invite only the one who has shown them kindness.&#8221; The simplest interpretation in this context is &#8220;many proclaim [themselves to be] a kind person (= a loyal friend).&#8221; The contrast is between many who claim to be loyal friends and the one who actually proves to be faithful. </p>
<A NAME="2020"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1728><b>tn</b> The shift to the expression &#8220;a man of faithfulness[es]&#8221; in the second line indicates that of all those who claim to show faithful love, it is rare to find one who is truly reliable (as the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">emunim</font>] indicates clearly); cf. NAB, NRSV &#8220;one worthy of trust.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2021"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1729><b>sn</b> The point of the rhetorical question is that a truly faithful friend is very difficult to find.</p>
<A NAME="2022"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1730><b>sn</b> Two terms describe the subject of this proverb: &#8220;righteous&#8221; and &#8220;integrity.&#8221; The first describes the person as a member of the covenant community who strives to live according to God&#8217;s standards; the second emphasizes that his lifestyle is blameless.</p>
<A NAME="2023"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1731><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;walks in his integrity&#8221; (so NASB); cf. NIV &#8220;leads a blameless life.&#8221; The Hitpael participle of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">halakh</font>) means &#8220;to walk about; to walk to and fro.&#8221; The idiom of walking representing living is intensified here in this stem. This verbal stem is used in scripture to describe people &#8220;walking with&#8221; God.</p>
<A NAME="2024"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1732><b>sn</b> The nature and the actions of parents have an effect on children (e.g., Exod 20:4-6); if the parents are righteous, the children will enjoy a blessing &#8211; the respect and the happiness which the parent reflects on them.</p>
<A NAME="2025"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1733><b>tn</b> The infinitive construct is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font>; it indicates purpose, &#8220;to judge&#8221; (so NIV, NCV) even though it does not have the preposition with it.</p>
<A NAME="2026"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1734><b>tn</b> The second line uses the image of winnowing (cf. NIV, NRSV) to state that the king&#8217;s judgment removes evil from the realm. The verb form is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1494;&#1464;&#1512;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿzareh</font>), the Piel participle. It has been translated &#8220;to sift; to winnow; to scatter&#8221; and &#8220;to separate&#8221; &#8211; i.e., separate out evil from the land. The text is saying that a just government roots out evil (cf. NAB &#8220;dispels all evil&#8221;), but few governments have been consistently just.</p>
<A NAME="2027"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1735><b>sn</b> The phrase <i>with his eyes</i> indicates that the king will closely examine or look into all the cases that come before him. </p>
<A NAME="2028"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1736><b>sn</b> The verse is a rhetorical question; it is affirming that no one can say this because no one is pure and free of sin.</p>
<A NAME="2029"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1737><b>tn</b> The verb form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zikkiti</font>) is the Piel perfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1499;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zakhah</font>, &#8220;to be clear; to be clean; to be pure&#8221;). The verb has the idea of &#8220;be clear, justified, acquitted.&#8221; In this stem it is causative: &#8220;I have made my heart clean&#8221; (so NRSV) or &#8220;kept my heart pure&#8221; (so NIV). This would be claiming that all decisions and motives were faultless.</p>
<A NAME="2030"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1738><b>sn</b> The Hebrew verb translated &#8220;I am pure&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1464;&#1492;&#1461;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">taher</font>) is a Levitical term. To claim this purity would be to claim that moral and cultic perfection had been attained and therefore one was acceptable to God in the present condition. Of course, no one can claim this; even if one thought it true, it is impossible to know all that is in the heart as God knows it.</p>
<A NAME="2031"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1739><b>tn</b> The construction simply uses repetition to express different kinds of weights and measures: &#8220;a stone and a stone, an ephah and an ephah.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2032"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1740><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;an abomination of the <sc>Lord.&#8221; The phrase features a subjective genitive: &#8220;the <sc>Lord abhors.&#8221; </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Behind this proverb is the image of the dishonest merchant who has different sets of weights and measures which are used to cheat customers. The Lord hates dishonesty in business transactions.</p>
<A NAME="2033"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1741><b>sn</b> In the first nine chapters of the book of Proverbs the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">na</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ar</font>) referred to an adolescent, a young person whose character was being formed in his early life. </p>
<A NAME="2034"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1742><b>sn</b> The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nakhar</font>) means &#8220;to recognize&#8221; more than simply &#8220;to know.&#8221; Certain character traits can be recognized in a child by what he does (cf. NCV &#8220;by their behavior&#8221;). </p>
<A NAME="2035"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1743><b>sn</b> Character is demonstrated by actions at any age. But the emphasis of the book of Proverbs would also be that if the young child begins to show such actions, then the parents must try to foster and cultivate them; if not, they must try to develop them through teaching and discipline.</p>
<A NAME="2036"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1744><b>sn</b> The first half of the verse refers to two basic senses that the <sc>Lord has given to people. C. H. Toy, however, thinks that they represent all the faculties (<i>Proverbs </i>[ICC], 388). But in the book of Proverbs seeing and hearing come to the fore. By usage &#8220;hearing&#8221; also means obeying (15:31; 25:12), and &#8220;seeing&#8221; also means perceiving and understanding (Isa 6:9-10).</p>
<A NAME="2037"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1745><b>sn</b> The verse not only credits God with making these faculties of hearing and sight and giving them to people, but it also emphasizes their spiritual use in God&#8217;s service.</p>
<A NAME="2038"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1746><b>sn</b> The proverb uses antithetical parallelism to teach that diligence leads to prosperity. It contrasts loving sleep with opening the eyes, and poverty with satisfaction. Just as &#8220;sleep&#8221; can be used for slothfulness or laziness, so opening the eyes can represent vigorous, active conduct. The idioms have caught on in modern usage as well &#8211; things like &#8220;open your eyes&#8221; or &#8220;asleep on the job.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2039"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1747><b>tn</b> The second line uses two imperatives in a sequence (without the <i>vav</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>]): &#8220;open your eyes&#8221; and then (or, in order that) you will &#8220;be satisfied.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2040"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1748><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;bread&#8221; (so KJV, ASV, NRSV), although the term often serves in a generic sense for food in general.</p>
<A NAME="2041"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1749><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[It is] bad, [it is] bad.&#8221; Since &#8220;bad&#8221; can be understood in some modern contexts as a descriptive adjective meaning &#8220;good,&#8221; the translation uses &#8220;worthless&#8221; instead &#8211; the real point of the prospective buyer&#8217;s exclamation.</p>
<A NAME="2042"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1750><b>sn</b> This proverb reflects standard procedure in the business world. When negotiating the transaction the buyer complains how bad the deal is for him, or how worthless the prospective purchase, but then later brags about what a good deal he got. The proverb will alert the inexperienced as to how things are done.</p>
<A NAME="2043"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1751><b>tn</b> The Hitpael imperfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">halal</font>) means &#8220;to praise&#8221; &#8211; to talk in glowing terms, excitedly. In this stem it means &#8220;to praise oneself; to boast.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2044"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1752><b>tn</b> The verse is usually taken as antithetical parallelism: There may be gold and rubies but the true gem is knowledge. However, C. H. Toy arranges it differently: &#8220;store of gold and wealth of corals and precious vessels &#8211; all are wise lips&#8221; (<i>Proverbs</i> [ICC], 388). But this uses the gems as metaphors for wise speech, and does not stress the contrast between wealth and wisdom.</p>
<A NAME="2045"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1753><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;lips of knowledge.&#8221; The term &#8220;lips&#8221; is a metonymy for speaking, and &#8220;knowledge&#8221; could be either an attributive genitive or objective genitive: &#8220;knowledgeable lips.&#8221; Lips that impart knowledge are the true jewel to be sought.</p>
<A NAME="2046"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1754><b>tn</b> The comparative &#8220;like&#8221; does not appear in the Hebrew text, but is implied by the metaphor; it is supplied in the translation for the sake of clarity.</p>
<A NAME="2047"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1755><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;his garment.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2048"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1756><b>sn</b> Taking a garment was the way of holding someone responsible to pay debts. In fact, the garment was the article normally taken for security (Exod 22:24-26; Deut 24:10-13). Because this is a high risk security pledge (e.g., 6:1-5), the creditor is to deal more severely than when the pledge is given by the debtor for himself.</p>
<A NAME="2049"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=1757><b>tc</b> The <i>Kethib</i> has the masculine plural form, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1499;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nakhrim</font>), suggesting a reading &#8220;strangers.&#8221; But the <i>Qere</i> has the feminine form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1499;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nakhriyyah</font>), &#8220;strange woman&#8221; or &#8220;another man&#8217;s wife&#8221; (e.g., 27:13). The parallelism would suggest &#8220;strangers&#8221; is the correct reading, although theories have been put forward for the interpretation of &#8220;strange woman&#8221; (see below).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The one for whom the pledge is taken is called &#8220;a stranger&#8221; and &#8220;foreign.&#8221; These two words do not necessarily mean that the individual or individuals are non-Israelite &#8211; just outside the community and not well known.</p>
<A NAME="2050"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=1758><b>tn</b> M. Dahood argues that the cloak was taken in pledge for a harlot (cf. NIV &#8220;a wayward woman&#8221;). Two sins would then be committed: taking a cloak and going to a prostitute (&#8220;To Pawn One&#8217;s Cloak,&#8221; <i>Bib</i> 42 [1961]: 359-66; also Snijders, &#8220;The Meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1512;</font>,&#8221; 85-86). In the MT the almost identical proverb in 27:13 has a feminine singular form here.</p>
<A NAME="2051"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=1759><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;hold it&#8221; (so NIV, NCV).</p>
<A NAME="2052"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=1760><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;bread of deceit&#8221; (so KJV, NAB). This refers to food gained through dishonest means. The term &#8220;bread&#8221; is a synecdoche of specific for general, referring to anything obtained by fraud, including food.</p>
<A NAME="2053"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=1761><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a man.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2054"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=1762><b>sn</b> The image of food and eating is carried throughout the proverb. Food taken by fraud seems sweet at first, but afterward it is not. To end up with a mouth full of gravel (a mass of small particles; e.g., Job 20:14-15; Lam 3:16) implies by comparison that what has been taken by fraud will be worthless and useless and certainly in the way (like food turning into sand and dirt).</p>
<A NAME="2055"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=1763><b>tn</b> The noun form is plural, but the verb is singular, suggesting either an abstract plural or a collective plural is being used here.</p>
<A NAME="2056"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=1764><b>tn</b> The clause begins with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) on &#8220;with guidance.&#8221; But the clause has an imperative for its main verb. One could take the imperfect tense in the first colon as an imperfect of injunction, and then this clause would be also instructional. But the imperfect tense is a Niphal, and so it is better to take the first colon as the foundational clause and the second colon as the consequence (cf. NAB): If that is true, then you should do this.</p>
<A NAME="2057"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=1765><b>sn</b> There have been attempts by various commentators to take &#8220;war&#8221; figuratively to mean life&#8217;s struggles, litigation, or evil inclinations. But there is no need and little justification for such interpretations. The proverb simply describes the necessity of taking counsel before going to war.</p>
<A NAME="2058"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=1766><b>sn</b> The word describes a slanderer (NASB), a tale-bearer (KJV, ASV), or an informer.
