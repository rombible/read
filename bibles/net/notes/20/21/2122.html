<A NAME="2122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1825><b>tn</b> The first line of the proverb is difficult. Since <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1464;&#1494;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vazar</font>) occurs only here it has been given much attention. The translation of &#8220;guilty&#8221; is drawn from an Arabic cognate meaning &#8220;to bear a burden&#8221; and so &#8220;to be sin laden&#8221; or &#8220;guilty&#8221; (cf. NASB, NIV, NCV, NRSV, NLT). G. R. Driver prefers to read the line as &#8220;a man crooked of ways is false [<i>zar</i>]&#8221; (&#8220;Problems in the Hebrew Text of Proverbs,&#8221; <i>Bib</i> 32 [1951]: 185). C. H. Toy adopts the meaning of &#8220;proud&#8221; (<i>Proverbs</i> [ICC], 400). Whatever the reading, &#8220;guilty&#8221; or &#8220;proud&#8221; or &#8220;false,&#8221; the idea is that such people are devious. Bad people are underhanded; good people are aboveboard (C. H. Toy, <i>Proverbs</i> [ICC], 400). Another way to analyze the line is to read it with the definition &#8220;strange, stranger&#8221;: &#8220;The way of a man and a stranger is perverse.&#8221; But this is unclear, and would form no satisfactory contrast to 8b. Another suggestion is &#8220;the way of (usual) man is changeable and strange, but the pure fellow leads a straight and even course&#8221; (J. H. Greenstone, <i>Proverbs</i>, 244); cf. NLT &#8220;the innocent travel a straight road.&#8221; </p>
