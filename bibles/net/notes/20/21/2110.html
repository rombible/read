<A NAME="2110"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1813><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;diligent&#8221; is an adjective used substantivally. The related verb means &#8220;to cut, sharpen, decide&#8221;; so the adjective describes one who is &#8220;sharp&#8221; &#8211; one who acts decisively. The word &#8220;hasty&#8221; has the idea of being pressed or pressured into quick actions. So the text contrasts calculated expeditiousness with unproductive haste. C. H. Toy does not like this contrast, and so proposes changing the latter to &#8220;lazy&#8221; (<i>Proverbs</i> [ICC], 399), but W. McKane rightly criticizes that as unnecessarily forming a pedestrian antithesis (<i>Proverbs </i>[OTL], 550). </p>
