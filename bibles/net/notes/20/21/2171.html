<A NAME="2171"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=1874><b>sn</b> In a war the victory is credited not so much to the infantry as to the tactician who plans the attack. Brilliant strategy wins wars, even over apparently insuperable odds (e.g., Prov 24:5-6; Eccl 9:13-16; 2 Cor 10:4). </p>
