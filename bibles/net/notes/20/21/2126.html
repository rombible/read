<A NAME="2126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1829><b>tn</b> The &#8220;house of company&#8221; has received numerous interpretations. The word &#8220;company&#8221; or &#8220;companionship&#8221; would qualify &#8220;house&#8221; as a place to be shared. The <i>BHS</i> editors propose &#8220;spacious house,&#8221; which would call for a transposition of letters (cf. NAB &#8220;a roomy house&#8221;; NLT &#8220;a lovely home&#8221;). Such an emendation makes good sense, but has no external support.</p>
