<A NAME="219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1812><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the tillage [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1460;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nir</font>] of the wicked is sin&#8221; (so NAB). The subject picks up the subjects of the first half of the verse, indicating they are equal &#8211; the tillage consists of the arrogance and pride. The word &#8220;tillage&#8221; is figurative, of course, signifying that the agricultural product (the point of the comparison) of the wicked is sin. The relationship between the ideas is then problematic. Are pride and arrogance what the wicked produce? Some (ASV, NASB, NIV, NRSV) have followed the LXX and <i>Tg</i>. Prov 21:4 to read &#8220;lamp&#8221; instead (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1461;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ner</font>), but that does not solve the difficulty of the relationship between the expressions. It does, however, say that the life ( = lamp), which is arrogance and pride, is sin.</p>
