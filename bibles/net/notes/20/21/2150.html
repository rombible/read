<A NAME="2150"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=1853><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;will remain&#8221; or &#8220;will rest.&#8221; The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nuakh</font>) does not here carry any of the connotations of comforting repose in death that the righteous enjoy; it simply means &#8220;to remain; to reside; to dwell.&#8221; The choice of this verb might have an ironic twist to it, reminding the wicked what might have been.</p>
