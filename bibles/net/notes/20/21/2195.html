<A NAME="2195"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">95</span><note=1898><b>tc</b> The <i>Kethib</i> is the imperfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kun</font>), &#8220;he establishes.&#8221; This reading has the support of the Syriac, Latin, and <i>Tg</i>. Prov 21:29, and is followed by ASV. The <i>Qere</i> is the imperfect tense of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bin</font>), &#8220;he understands; he discerns.&#8221; It has the support of the LXX and is followed by NIV, NCV, NRSV, NLT. The difficulty is that both make good sense in the passage and both have support. The contrast is between the wicked who shows a bold face (reflecting a hardened heart) and the upright who either gives thought to his ways (or solidifies his ways). The sense of the <i>Qere</i> may form a slightly better contrast, one between the outer appearance of boldness and the inner discernment of action.</p>
