<A NAME="2135"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1838><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;house.&#8221; This term probably means &#8220;household&#8221; here &#8211; the family. One way to read the line is that the righteous judge (human or divine) takes into consideration the wicked person&#8217;s family before judging the wicked person. The other &#8211; and more plausible &#8211; interpretation is that the judge considers the household of the wicked and then on the basis of what was observed judges them. </p>
