<A NAME="2168"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">68</span><note=1871><b>sn</b> The Hebrew term translated &#8220;bounty&#8221; is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1511;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsÿdaqah</font>) again, so there is a wordplay on the term in the verse. The first use of the word had the basic meaning of &#8220;conduct that conforms to God&#8217;s standard&#8221;; this second use may be understood as a metonymy of cause, indicating the provision or reward (&#8220;bounty&#8221;) that comes from keeping righteousness (cf. NIV &#8220;prosperity&#8221;; NCV &#8220;success&#8221;). The proverb is similar to Matt 5:6, &#8220;Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be satisfied.&#8221;</p>
