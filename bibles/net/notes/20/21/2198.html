<A NAME="2198"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">98</span><note=1901><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;of the <sc>Lord.&#8221; The victory being &#8220;of the <sc>Lord&#8221; means that it is accomplished by him. Ultimate success comes from the <sc>Lord and not from human efforts. The faithful have acknowledged this down through the ages, even though they have been responsible and have prepared for the wars. Without this belief there would have been no prayer on the eve of battle (e.g., Ps 20:7 and 33:17). </p>
