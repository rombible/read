<A NAME="2188"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">88</span><note=1891><b>tn</b> The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zimmah</font>) means &#8220;plan; device; wickedness&#8221;; here it indicates that the person is coming to the ritual with &#8220;sinful purpose.&#8221; Some commentators suggest that this would mean he comes with the sacrifice as a bribe to pacify his conscience for a crime committed, over which he has little remorse or intent to cease (cf. NLT &#8220;with ulterior motives&#8221;). In this view, people in ancient Israel came to think that sacrifices could be given for any reason without genuine submission to God.</p>
