<A NAME="2191"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">91</span><note=1894><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;but a man who listens speaks forever.&#8221; The first part of it may mean (1) a true witness, one who reports what he actually hears. But it may also refer to (2) someone who listens to the false testimony given by the false witness. The NIV follows the suggestion of a homonym for the Hebrew word with the meaning &#8220;will perish/be destroyed&#8221;: &#8220;will be destroyed forever.&#8221; This suggests a synonymous pair of ideas rather than a contrast. Others accept antithetical parallelism. C. H. Toy suggested an idea like &#8220;be established&#8221; to contrast with &#8220;will perish&#8221; (<i>Proverbs</i> [ICC], 411). W. McKane suggested it meant the truthful witness &#8220;will speak to the end&#8221; without being put down (<i>Proverbs </i>[OTL], 556). It is simpler to interpret the words that are here in the sense of a contrast. The idea of speaking forever/to the end would then be hyperbolic.</p>
