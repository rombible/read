<A NAME="2164"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=1867><b>tn</b> The mention of &#8220;olive oil&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1502;&#1462;&#1503;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shemen</font>) is problematic in the line &#8211; how can a fool devour it? Several attempts have been made to alleviate the problem. The NIV interprets &#8220;treasure&#8221; as &#8220;choice food,&#8221; so that food and oil would make more sense being swallowed. C. H. Toy (<i>Proverbs </i>[ICC], 406) suggests dropping &#8220;oil&#8221; altogether based on the reading in the LXX, but the Greek is too general for any support: It has &#8220;precious treasure will rest on the mouth of the sage.&#8221; W. McKane wants to change &#8220;oil&#8221; to an Arabic word &#8220;expensive&#8221; to read &#8220;desirable and rare wealth&#8221; (<i>Proverbs </i>[OTL], 552), but this idea does not match the metaphor any better. The figure of &#8220;devouring&#8221; in the second line simply means the fool uses up whatever he has. </p>
