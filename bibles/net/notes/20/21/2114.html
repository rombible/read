<A NAME="2114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1817><b>tn</b> The first word of the verse is the noun meaning &#8220;doing, deed, work.&#8221; The <i>BHS </i>editors suggest reading with the LXX an active participle &#8211; &#8220;the one who makes&#8221; (cf. NAB &#8220;He who makes&#8221;). The second word means &#8220;treasure,&#8221; from the verb &#8220;lay up, store up.&#8221; It is an objective genitive here. </p>
