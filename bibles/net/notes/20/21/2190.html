<A NAME="2190"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">90</span><note=1893><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb translated &#8220;will perish&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1465;&#1488;&#1489;&#1461;&#1491;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">bed</font>) could mean that the false witness will die, either by the hand of God or by the community. But it also could be taken in the sense that the false testimony will be destroyed. This would mean that &#8220;false witness&#8221; would be a metonymy of cause &#8211; what he says will perish (cf. NCV &#8220;will be forgotten&#8221;). </p>
