<A NAME="2147"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1850><b>sn</b> The noun means &#8220;terror (NAB, NASB, NIV), destruction (KJV, ASV), ruin (cf. NCV).&#8221; Its related verb means &#8220;be shattered, dismayed.&#8221; The idea of &#8220;dismay&#8221; (NRSV) or &#8220;terror&#8221; would make the better choice to contrast with &#8220;joy&#8221; in the first line, but &#8220;ruin&#8221; is also possible. Whenever justice prevails, whether in the courts or simply in society, the people who practice iniquity may be shaken into reality by fear (cf. CEV &#8220;crooks are terrified&#8221;).</p>
