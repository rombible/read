<A NAME="2133"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1836><b>tn</b> In the book of Proverbs, the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1468;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ysadiq</font>) normally refers to a human being, and that is a possible translation here (cf. KJV, ASV, NAB), although it would have to refer to a righteous person who was a judge or a ruler with the right to destroy the wicked. Many commentators and English versions simply interpret this as a reference to God (cf. NIV, NRSV, TEV, NLT). </p>
