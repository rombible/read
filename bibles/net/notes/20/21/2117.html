<A NAME="2117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1820><b>tn</b> The Hebrew has &#8220;seekers of death,&#8221; meaning &#8220;[they that seek them] are seekers of death,&#8221; or that the fortune is &#8220;a fleeting vapor for those who seek death.&#8221; The sense is not readily apparent. The Greek and the Latin versions have &#8220;snares of death&#8221;; the form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1511;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">moqÿshe</font>) was read instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1511;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿvaqshe</font>). This reading does not make a more credible metaphor, and one must explain the loss of the letter <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;</font> (<i>bet</i>) in the textual variant. It is, however, slightly easier to interpret in the verse, and is followed by a number of English versions (e.g., NAB, NIV, NRSV, NLT). But whether the easier reading is the correct one in this case would be difficult to prove.</p>
