<A NAME="2186"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">86</span><note=1889><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the sacrifice of the wicked&#8221; (so KJV, NAB, NASB, NIV, NRSV). This is a subjective genitive. The foundational clause states that ritual acts of worship brought by the wicked (thus a subjective genitive) are detestable to God. The &#8220;wicked&#8221; refers here to people who are not members of the covenant (no faith) and are not following after righteousness (no acceptable works). But often they participate in sanctuary ritual, which amounts to hypocrisy.</p>
