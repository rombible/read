<A NAME="2839"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=2321><b>sn</b> This verse is unique in the book of Proverbs; it captures the theology of forgiveness (e.g., Pss 32 and 51). Every part of the passage is essential to the point: Confession of sins as opposed to concealing them, coupled with a turning away from them, results in mercy.</p>
