<A NAME="2828"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2310><b>sn</b> C. H. Toy says, &#8220;If a man, on his part, is deaf to instruction, then God, on his part, is deaf to prayer&#8221; (<i>Proverbs </i>[ICC], 499). And W. McKane observes that one who fails to attend to God&#8217;s law is a wicked person, even if he is a man of prayer (<i>Proverbs </i>[OTL], 623).</p>
