<A NAME="2840"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=2322><b>tn</b> Most commentators (and some English versions, e.g., NIV) assume that the participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1508;&#1463;&#1495;&#1461;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿfakhed</font>, &#8220;fears&#8221;) means &#8220;fears the <sc>Lord,&#8221; even though &#8220;the <sc>Lord&#8221; is not present in the text. Such an assumption would be more convincing if the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yir</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">at</font>) had been used. It is possible that the verse refers to fearing sin or its consequences. In other words, the one who is always apprehensive about the nature and consequences of sin will avoid sin and find God&#8217;s blessing. Of course the assumption that the phrase means &#8220;fear the <sc>Lord&#8221; could be correct as well. There would be little difference in the outcome; in either case sin would be avoided.</p>
