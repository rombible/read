<A NAME="287"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2289><b>tc</b> The MT reads &#8220;a poor man,&#8221; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1462;&#1489;&#1462;&#1512; &#1512;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gever rash</font>); cf. KJV, NASB, NLT. The problem is that the poor in the book of Proverbs is not an oppressor and does not have the power to be such. So commentators assume the word is incorrect. By a slight change to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rasha</font>&#8217;) the reading becomes &#8220;a wicked ruler&#8221; [<i>Heb</i> &#8220;a wicked mighty man&#8221;]. There is no textual support for this change. The LXX, however, reads, &#8220;A courageous man oppresses the poor with impieties.&#8221; If &#8220;a poor man&#8221; is retained, then the oppression would include betrayal &#8211; one would expect a poor man to have sympathy for others who are impoverished, but in fact that is not the case. It is a sad commentary on human nature that the truly oppressed people can also be oppressed by other poor people.</p>
