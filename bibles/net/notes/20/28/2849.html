<A NAME="2849"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=2331><b>tn</b> The verse is cryptic; it simply says that he will &#8220;flee to the pit.&#8221; Some have taken the &#8220;pit&#8221; to refer to the place of detention for prisoners, but why would he flee to that place? It seems rather to refer to death. This could mean that (1) since there is no place for him to go outside of the grave, he should flee to the pit (cf. TEV, NLT), or (2) he will be a fugitive until he goes to the grave (cf. NASB, NIV, NCV, NRSV, CEV). Neither one of these options is easily derived from the text. The verse seems to be saying that the one who is guilty of murder will flee, and no one should assist him. The meaning of &#8220;the pit&#8221; is unresolved.</p>
