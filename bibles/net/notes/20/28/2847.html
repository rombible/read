<A NAME="2847"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=2329><b>tn</b> The form is the Qal<i> </i>passive participle. The verb means &#8220;to oppress; to wrong; to extort&#8221;; here the idea of being &#8220;oppressed&#8221; would refer to the burden of a guilty conscience (hence &#8220;tormented&#8221;; cf. NAB, NRSV &#8220;burdened&#8221;). Some commentators have wanted to emend the text to read &#8220;suspected,&#8221; or &#8220;charged with,&#8221; or &#8220;given to,&#8221; etc., but if the motive is religious and not legal, then &#8220;oppressed&#8221; or &#8220;tormented&#8221; is preferred.</p>
