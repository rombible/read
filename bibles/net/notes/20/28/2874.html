<A NAME="2874"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">74</span><note=2356><b>sn</b> The idea of &#8220;trusting in one&#8217;s own heart&#8221; is a way of describing one who is self-reliant. C. H. Toy says it means to follow the untrained suggestions of the mind or to rely on one&#8217;s own mental resources (<i>Proverbs </i>[ICC], 505). It is arrogant to take no counsel but to rely only on one&#8217;s own intelligence.</p>
