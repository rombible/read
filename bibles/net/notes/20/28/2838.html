<A NAME="2838"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=2320><b>sn</b> The verse contrasts the consequences of each. The person who refuses to confess will not prosper. This is an understatement (a figure of speech known as tapeinosis); the opposite is the truth, that eventually such a person will be undone and ruined. On the other hand, the penitent will find mercy. This expression is a metonymy of cause for the effect &#8211; although &#8220;mercy&#8221; is mentioned, what mercy provides is intended, i.e., forgiveness. In other passages the verb &#8220;conceal&#8221; is used of God&#8217;s forgiveness &#8211; he covers over the iniquity (Ps 32:1). Whoever acknowledges sin, God will cover it; whoever covers it, God will lay it open.</p>
