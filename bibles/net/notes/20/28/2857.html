<A NAME="2857"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=2339><b>sn</b> The proverb is not rebuking diligent labor. One who is eager to get rich quickly is the opposite of the faithful person. The first person is faithful to God and to the covenant community; the second is trying to get rich as quickly as possible, at the least without doing an honest day&#8217;s work and at the worst dishonestly. In a hurry to gain wealth, he falls into various schemes and will pay for it. <i>Tg</i>. Prov 28:20 interprets this to say he hastens through deceit and wrongdoing.</p>
