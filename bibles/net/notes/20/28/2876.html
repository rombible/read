<A NAME="2876"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">76</span><note=2358><b>tn</b> The verb form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1461;&#1496;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yimmalet</font>) is the Niphal imperfect; the form means &#8220;to escape.&#8221; In this context one would conclude that it means &#8220;to escape from trouble,&#8221; because the one who lives in this life by wisdom will escape trouble, and the one who trusts in himself will not.</p>
