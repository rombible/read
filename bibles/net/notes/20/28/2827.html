<A NAME="2827"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2309><b>sn</b> It is hard to imagine how someone who willfully refuses to obey the law of God would pray according to the will of God. Such a person is more apt to pray for some physical thing or make demands on God. (Of course a prayer of repentance would be an exception and would not be an abomination to the <sc>Lord.)</p>
