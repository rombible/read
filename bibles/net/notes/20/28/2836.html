<A NAME="2836"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=2318><b>tn</b> The meaning of &#8220;sought out&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1495;&#1467;&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yÿkhuppas</font>) indicates that people have gone into hiding. So the development of the ideas for this proverb require in the first line that &#8220;rejoice&#8221; be connected with &#8220;triumph&#8221; that means they have come to power; and in the second line that &#8220;are sought out&#8221; means people have gone into hiding (cf. ASV, NIV, NRSV, NLT). C. H. Toy thinks this is too strained; he offers this rendering: &#8220;When the righteous are exalted there is great confidence, but when the wicked come into power men hide themselves&#8221; (<i>Proverbs </i>[ICC], 500). For the verb G. R. Driver posits an Arabic cognate <i>hafasa</i>, &#8220;prostrated; trampled on&#8221; (&#8220;Problems in the Hebrew Text of Proverbs,&#8221; <i>Bib</i> 32 [1951]: 192-93), which gives a clearer result of wicked rule, but is perhaps unnecessary (e.g., Prov 28:28; 29:2). See J. A. Emerton, &#8220;Notes on Some Passages in the Book of Proverbs,&#8221; <i>JTS</i> 20 (1969): 202-20.</p>
