<A NAME="2810"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2292><b>sn</b> Some commentators do not think that the word refers to the Mosaic law, but to &#8220;instruction&#8221; or &#8220;teaching&#8221; in general (cf. NCV &#8220;who disobey what they have been taught&#8221;). However, the expression &#8220;keep the law&#8221; in the second line indicates that it is binding, which would not be true of teaching in general (J. Bright, &#8220;The Apodictic Prohibition: Some Observations,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 92 [1973]: 185-204). Moreover, Proverbs 28:9 and 29:18 refer to the law, and this chapter has a stress on piety.</p>
