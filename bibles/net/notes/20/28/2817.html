<A NAME="2817"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2299><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term translated &#8220;ways&#8221; is in the dual, suggesting that the person has double ways, i.e., he is hypocritical. C. H. Toy does not like this idea and changes the form to the plural (<i>Proverbs </i>[ICC], 497), but his emendation is gratuitous and should be rejected.</p>
