<A NAME="2820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2302><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word could refer (1) to &#8220;instruction&#8221; by the father (cf. NCV) or (2) the Mosaic law (so most English versions). The chapter seems to be stressing religious obedience, so the referent is probably the law. Besides, the father&#8217;s teaching will be what the law demands, and the one who associates with gluttons is not abiding by the law.</p>
