<A NAME="2815"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2297><b>sn</b> The contrast (and the difference) is between the wicked and those who seek the <sc>Lord. Originally the idea of seeking the <sc>Lord meant to obtain an oracle (2 Sam 21:1), but then it came to mean devotion to God &#8211; seeking to learn and do his will. Only people who are interested in doing the <sc>Lord&#8217;s will can fully understand justice. Without that standard, legal activity can become self-serving.</p>
