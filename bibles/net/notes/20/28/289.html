<A NAME="289"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2291><b>sn</b> &#8220;Food&#8221; is a metonymy of effect here. The picture is of the driving rain that should cause crops to grow so that food can be produced &#8211; but does not (some English versions assume the crops are destroyed instead, e.g., NCV, TEV, CEV, NLT). The point the proverb is making is that a show of strength may not produce anything except ruin.</p>
