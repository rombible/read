<A NAME="2851"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=2333><b>tn</b> The Qal imperfect <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yipol</font>) is given a future translation in this context, as is the previous verb (&#8220;will be delivered&#8221;) because the working out of divine retribution appears to be coming suddenly in the future. The idea of &#8220;falling&#8221; could be a metonymy of adjunct (with the falling accompanying the ruin that comes to the person), or it may simply be a comparison between falling and being destroyed. Cf. NCV &#8220;will suddenly be ruined&#8221;; NLT &#8220;will be destroyed.&#8221;</p>
