On the other hand there is the one who both &#8220;confesses&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;&#1462;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">modeh</font>) and &#8220;forsakes&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1465;&#1494;&#1461;&#1489;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">ozev</font>) the sin.
