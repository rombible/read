<A NAME="2883"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">83</span><note=2365><b>tn</b> The form is the Niphal imperfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">satar</font>, &#8220;to hide&#8221;); in this stem it can mean &#8220;to hide themselves&#8221; or &#8220;to go into hiding.&#8221; In either case the expression would be a hyperbole; the populace would not go into hiding, but they would tread softly and move about cautiously. G. R. Driver suggests the Akkadian <i>sataru</i> instead, which means &#8220;to demolish,&#8221; and is cognate to the Aramaic &#8220;to destroy.&#8221; This would produce the idea that people are &#8220;destroyed&#8221; when the wicked come to power (&#8220;Problems in the Hebrew Text of Proverbs,&#8221; <i>Bib</i> 32 [1951]: 192-93). That meaning certainly fits the idea, but there is no reason for the change because the MT is perfectly readable as it is and makes good sense.</p>
