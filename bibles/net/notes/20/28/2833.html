<A NAME="2833"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=2315><b>tn</b> The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1511;&#1456;&#1512;&#1462;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yakhqÿrennu</font>) means &#8220;he searches him&#8221; (cf. KJV, ASV) or &#8220;he examines him&#8221;; a potential imperfect nuance fits well here to indicate that a discerning person, even though poor, can search the flaws of the rich and see through the pretension and the false assumptions (cf. NAB, NASB, NIV &#8220;sees through him&#8221;). Several commentators have connected the word to the Arabic root <i>hqr</i>, which means &#8220;despise&#8221; (D. W. Thomas, &#8220;Notes on Some Passages in the Book of Proverbs,&#8221; <i>JTS</i> 38 [1937]: 400-403), but that would be both predictable and flat.</p>
