<A NAME="1050"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=779><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a rod is for the back of the one lacking heart.&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1489;&#1462;&#1496;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shevet</font>, &#8220;rod&#8221;) functions figuratively: synecdoche of specific (= rod of discipline) for general (= discipline in general). The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1461;&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gev</font>, &#8220;back&#8221;) is a synecdoche of part (= back) for the whole (= person as a whole). The back is emphasized because it was the object of physical corporeal discipline. This proverb is not limited in its application to physical corporeal punishment because the consequences of foolishness may come in many forms, physical corporeal discipline being only one form.</p>
