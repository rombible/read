<A NAME="1041"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=770><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a fountain of life is the mouth of the righteous&#8221; (NAB similar). The subject (&#8220;a fountain of life&#8221;) and the predicate (&#8220;the mouth of the righteous&#8221;) in the Hebrew text are reversed in the present translation (as in most English versions) for the sake of clarity and smoothness. The idea of this metaphor, &#8220;the fountain of life,&#8221; may come from Ps 36:9 (e.g., also Prov 13:14; 14:27; 16:22). What the righteous say is beneficial to life or life-giving. Their words are life-giving but the words of the wicked are violent. See R. B. Y. Scott, &#8220;Wise and Foolish, Righteous and Wicked,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 29 (1972): 145-65.</p>
