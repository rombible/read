<A NAME="1036"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=765><b>tn</b> The term (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1509;</font>, <font face="Scholar">qarats</font>) describes a person who habitually &#8220;winks&#8221; his eye maliciously as a secretive sign to those conspiring evil (Prov 6:13). This is a comparison rather than a contrast. Devious gestures are grievous, but not as ruinous as foolish talk. Both are to be avoided.</p>
