<A NAME="1010"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=739><b>tn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nefesh</font>) means &#8220;soul&#8221; but its root meaning is &#8220;throat&#8221; and it has a broad range of meanings; here it denotes &#8220;appetite&#8221; (BDB 660 s.v. 5.a; see, e.g., Pss 63:6; 107:9; Prov 27:7; Isa 56:11; 58:10; Jer 50:19; Ezek 7:19). The term could denote &#8220;desire&#8221; (BDB 660 s.v. 6.a) which would include the inner urge for success. By contrast, the wicked live unfulfilled lives &#8211; as far as spiritual values are concerned.</p>
