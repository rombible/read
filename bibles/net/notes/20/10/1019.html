<A NAME="1019"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=748><b>sn</b> The term &#8220;sleeps&#8221; is figurative, an implied comparison that has become idiomatic (like the contemporary English expression &#8220;asleep on the job&#8221;). It means that this individual is lazy or oblivious to the needs of the hour.</p>
