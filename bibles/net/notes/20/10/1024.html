<A NAME="1024"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=753><b>tn</b> The syntax of this line is ambiguous. The translation takes &#8220;the mouth of the wicked&#8221; as the nominative subject and &#8220;violence&#8221; as the accusative direct object; however, the subject might be &#8220;violence,&#8221; hence: &#8220;violence covers the mouth of the wicked&#8221; (cf. KJV, ASV, NIV).</p>
