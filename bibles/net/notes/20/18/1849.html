<A NAME="1849"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=1584><b>sn</b> The figure of a &#8220;crushed spirit&#8221; (ASV, NAB, NCV, NRSV &#8220;a broken spirit,&#8221; comparing depression to something smashed or crushed) suggests a broken will, a loss of vitality, despair, and emotional pain. In physical sickness one can fall back on the will to live; but in depression even the will to live is gone. </p>
