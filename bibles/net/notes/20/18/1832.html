<A NAME="1832"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1567><b>sn</b> The &#8220;name of the <sc>Lord&#8221; is a metonymy of subject. The &#8220;name&#8221; here signifies not the personal name &#8220;Yahweh,&#8221; for that would be redundant in the expression &#8220;the name of Yahweh,&#8221; but the attributes of the <sc>Lord (cf. Exod 34:5-7) &#8211; here his power to protect.</p>
