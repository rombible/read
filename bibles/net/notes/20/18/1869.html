<A NAME="1869"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">69</span><note=1604><b>sn</b> Two images are used in this proverb: the fruit of the mouth and the harvest of the lips. They are synonymous; the first is applied to the orchard and the second to the field. The &#8220;mouth&#8221; and the &#8220;lips&#8221; are metonymies of cause, and so both lines are speaking about speech that is productive.</p>
