<A NAME="1860"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=1595><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;casting the lot.&#8221; Because modern readers are not familiar with the ancient practice of casting lots, the image of the coin toss to decide an issue has been employed in the translation (cf. CEV &#8220;drawing straws&#8221;). Although the casting of lots is often compared to throwing dice, the translation &#8220;throwing dice ends disputes&#8221; in this context could be misunderstood to mean &#8220;participating in a game of dice ends disputes.&#8221;</p>
