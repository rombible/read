<A NAME="1876"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">76</span><note=1611><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;what is pleasant.&#8221; The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1510;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ratson</font>, &#8220;what is pleasing&#8221;) is often interpreted in a religious-theological sense here: &#8220;receives favor from the <sc>Lord&#8221; (cf. KJV, NASB, NIV, NRSV). However, this term is probably referring to the pleasure that a person enjoys in marriage, so it should be understood in a nonreligious, marital sense: &#8220;pleasure&#8221; (e.g., Esth 1:8; <i>HALOT</i> 1282 s.v. 1); cf. CEV &#8220;she is a gift from the Lord.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The parallelism is formal; the second line of the verse continues the first but explains it further: Finding a spouse, one receives a pleasurable gift from God.</p>
