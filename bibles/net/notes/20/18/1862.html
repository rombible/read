<A NAME="1862"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=1597><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;makes a separation&#8221; or &#8220;decides.&#8221; In the book of Proverbs this verb often has a negative connotation, such as separating close friends (e.g., 16:9). But here it has a positive nuance: Opponents are &#8220;separated&#8221; by settling the issue.</p>
