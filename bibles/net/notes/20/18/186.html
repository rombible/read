<A NAME="186"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1541><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his heart.&#8221; This is a metonymy meaning &#8220;what is on his mind&#8221; (cf. NAB &#8220;displaying what he thinks&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;expressing personal opinion&#8221;). This kind of person is in love with his own ideas and enjoys spewing them out (W. McKane, <i>Proverbs </i>[OTL], 515). It is the kind of person who would ask a question, not to learn, but to show everyone how clever he is (cf. TEV). </p>
