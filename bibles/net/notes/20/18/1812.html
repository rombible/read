<A NAME="1812"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1547><b>tn</b> There is debate about the nature of the parallelism between lines 4a and 4b. The major options are: (1) synonymous parallelism, (2) antithetical parallelism (e.g., NAB, NIV, NCV) or (3) formal parallelism. Normally a <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) would begin an antithetical clause; the structure and the ideas suggest that the second colon continues the idea of the first half, but in a parallel way rather than as additional predicates. The metaphors used in the proverb elsewhere describe the wise.</p>
