<A NAME="1881"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">81</span><note=1616><b>tn</b> The text simply has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1512;&#1465;&#1506;&#1461;&#1506;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿhitro</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ea</font>&#8217;), which means &#8220;for being crushed&#8221; or &#8220;to be shattered&#8221; (but not &#8220;to show oneself friendly&#8221; as in the KJV). What can be made of the sentence is that &#8220;a man who has [many] friends [may have them] for being crushed&#8221; &#8211; the infinitive giving the result (i.e., &#8220;with the result that he may be crushed by them&#8221;). </p>
