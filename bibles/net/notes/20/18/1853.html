<A NAME="1853"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=1588><b>sn</b> The Hebrew term translated &#8220;gift&#8221; is a more general term than &#8220;bribe&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1495;&#1463;&#1491;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shokhad</font>), used in 17:8, 23. But it also has danger (e.g., 15:27; 21:14), for by giving gifts one might learn how influential they are and use them for bribes. The proverb simply states that a gift can expedite matters.</p>
