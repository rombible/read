<A NAME="331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=265><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">quts</font>) has a two-fold range of meaning: (1) &#8220;to feel a loathing; to abhor&#8221; and (2) &#8220;to feel a sickening dread&#8221; (BDB 880 s.v.). The parallelism with &#8220;do not despise&#8221; suggests the former nuance here. The common response to suffering is to loathe it; however, the righteous understand that it refines one&#8217;s moral character and that it is a means to the blessing.</p>
