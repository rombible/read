<A NAME="335"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=269><b>tn</b> Although the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ashre</font>, &#8220;blessed&#8221;) is frequently translated &#8220;happy&#8221; here (so KJV, ASV, NAB, NCV, NRSV, TEV, NLT), such a translation can be somewhat misleading because the word means more than that &#8211; &#8220;happiness&#8221; depends on one&#8217;s circumstances. This word reflects that inner joy and heavenly bliss which comes to the person who is pleasing to God, whose way is right before God. </p>
