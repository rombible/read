<A NAME="322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=256><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;your navel&#8221; (cf. KJV, ASV). MT reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1512;&#1468;&#1462;&#1498;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sharrekha</font>, &#8220;your navel&#8221;) which functions as a synecdoche of part (= navel) for the whole (= body), meaning &#8220;your body&#8221; (BDB 1057 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;</font>). The geminate noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1465;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sor</font>, &#8220;navel; navel-string [= umbilical cord]&#8221;) occurs only two other times in OT (Ezek 16:4; Song 7:3). The LXX reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8183; &#963;&#8061;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#943; &#963;&#959;&#965; </font>(<font face="Greektl">tw swmati sou</font>, &#8220;your body&#8221;). So the <i>BHS</i> editors suggest emending MT to the more commonly used terms <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1512;&#1462;&#1498;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿsarekha</font>, &#8220;your flesh&#8221;) or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1512;&#1462;&#1498;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">erekha</font>, &#8220;your body&#8221;). But this kind of emendation runs counter to the canons of textual criticism; normally the more difficult reading or rarer term is preferred as original rather than a smooth reading or common term. Since &#8220;navel&#8221; occurs only twice elsewhere, it is difficult to imagine that it would have been confused for these two more common terms and that a scribe would mistakenly write &#8220;your navel&#8221; instead. If MT &#8220;your navel&#8221; is a synecdoche for &#8220;your body,&#8221; the LXX is not pointing to a different textual tradition but is merely interpreting MT accordingly. In similar fashion, the English versions which read &#8220;your body&#8221; are not rejecting the MT reading; they are merely interpreting the term as a figure (synecdoche) for &#8220;your body.&#8221;</p>
