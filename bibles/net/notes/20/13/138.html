The term &#8220;violence&#8221; is probably a metonymy of cause: &#8220;violence&#8221; represents what violence gains &#8211; ill-gotten gains resulting from violent crime. The wicked desire what does not belong to them.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tc</b> The LXX reads &#8220;the souls of the wicked perish untimely.&#8221; The MT makes sense as it stands.</p>
