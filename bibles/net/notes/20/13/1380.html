<A NAME="1380"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">80</span><note=1120><b>tc</b> The MT reads &#8220;there is what is swept away because [there is] no justice&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1461;&#1513;&#1473; &#1504;&#1460;&#1505;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1488; &#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1496;</font>, <font face="Scholar">vÿyesh nispeh bÿlo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> mishpat</font>). The LXX reads &#8220;the great enjoy wealth many years, but some men perish little by little.&#8221; The Syriac reads &#8220;those who have no habitation waste wealth many years, and some waste it completely.&#8221; <i>Tg</i>. Prov 13:23 reads &#8220;the great man devours the land of the poor, and some men are taken away unjustly.&#8221; The Vulgate has &#8220;there is much food in the fresh land of the fathers, and for others it is collected without judgment.&#8221; C. H. Toy says that the text is corrupt (<i>Proverbs</i> [ICC], 277). Nevertheless, the MT makes sense: The ground could produce enough food for people if there were no injustice in the land. Poverty is unnecessary as long as there is justice and not injustice.</p>
