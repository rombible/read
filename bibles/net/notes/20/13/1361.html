<A NAME="1361"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=1101><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;spreads open&#8221; [his folly]. W. McKane suggests that this is a figure of a peddler displaying his wares (<i>Proverbs</i> [OTL], 456; cf. NAB &#8220;the fool peddles folly&#8221;). If given a chance, a fool will reveal his foolishness in public. But the wise study the facts and make decisions accordingly.</p>
