<A NAME="1369"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">69</span><note=1109><b>sn</b> Honor and success are contrasted with poverty and shame; the key to enjoying the one and escaping the other is discipline and correction. W. McKane, <i>Proverbs </i>(OTL), 456, notes that it is a difference between a man of weight (power and wealth, from the idea of &#8220;heavy&#8221; for &#8220;honor&#8221;) and the man of straw (lowly esteemed and poor). </p>
