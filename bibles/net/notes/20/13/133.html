<A NAME="133"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1043><b>sn</b> The &#8220;scoffer&#8221; is the worst kind of fool. He has no respect for authority, reviles worship of God, and is unteachable because he thinks he knows it all. The change to a stronger word in the second colon &#8211; &#8220;rebuke&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ga</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ar</font>) &#8211; shows that he does not respond to instruction on any level. Cf. NLT &#8220;a young mocker,&#8221; taking this to refer to the opposite of the &#8220;wise son&#8221; in the first colon. </p>
