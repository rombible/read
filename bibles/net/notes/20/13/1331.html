<A NAME="1331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1071><b>tc</b> The LXX adds, &#8220;Deceitful souls go astray in sins, but the righteous are pitiful and merciful.&#8221; </p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">da</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">akh</font>) means &#8220;to go out [in reference to a fire or lamp]; to be extinguished.&#8221; The idea is that of being made extinct, snuffed out (cf. NIV, NLT). The imagery may have been drawn from the sanctuary where the flame was to be kept burning perpetually. Not so with the wicked.</p>
