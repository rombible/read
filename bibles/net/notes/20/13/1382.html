<A NAME="1382"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">82</span><note=1122><b>sn</b> The importance of parental disciplining is stressed by the verbs &#8220;hate&#8221; and &#8220;love.&#8221; &#8220;Hating&#8221; a child in this sense means in essence abandoning or rejecting him; &#8220;loving&#8221; a child means embracing and caring for him. Failure to discipline a child is tantamount to hating him &#8211; not caring about his character.</p>
