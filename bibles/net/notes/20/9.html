<A NAME="91"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=682><b>sn</b> Chapter 9 forms the conclusion of the lengthy introduction to the book. Both wisdom and folly will make their final appeals; and both appeal to the simpletons. Wisdom offers life with no mention of pleasure; folly offers pleasure with no mention of death. The first twelve verses concern accepting wisdom: the invitation of wisdom (1-6), the description of the responses (7-11), and the consequence (12). Verses 13-18 concern accepting folly: the invitation (13-17) and the consequence (18).</p>
<A NAME="92"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=683><b>sn</b> Wisdom is personified as a wise woman. She has prepared a house and established it on <i>seven pillars</i>. This is a reference to the habitable world (e.g., 8:31). For the equation of the house and the world, e.g., 8:29; Job 38:6; and Psalm 104:5 (also G. Boström, <i>Proverbiastudien </i>[LUÅ], 1-14). The &#8220;seven pillars&#8221; have been variously interpreted, but since seven is a number for completeness and sacredness, the idea seems to be that wisdom produced a perfect world.</p>
<A NAME="93"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=684><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;she has killed her killing.&#8221; Cf. KJV &#8220;hath killed her beasts&#8221;; NAB &#8220;has dressed her meat&#8221;; NASB &#8220;has prepared her food.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="94"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=685><b>sn</b> Wisdom has prepared a sumptuous banquet in this house and sends out her maids to call the simple to come and eat (M. Lichtenstein, &#8220;The Banquet Motif in Keret and in Proverbs 9,&#8221; <i>JANESCU</i> 1 [1968/69]: 19-31). The figures of meat and wine represent the good teaching of wisdom that will be palatable and profitable (implied comparisons). Compare Isaiah 55:1-2 and John 6:51, 55 for similar uses of the figures. The idea of mixing wine could refer to the practice of mixing wine with spices or with water (as the LXX text assumes; e.g., Prov 23:30; Isa 5:22). Mixed wine was the most intoxicating; thus, her wisdom is attractive. All the imagery lets the simple know that what wisdom has to offer is marvelous.</p>
<A NAME="95"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=686><b>tn</b> The text uses two synonymous terms in construct to express the superlative degree.</p>
<A NAME="96"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=687><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;lacking of heart she says to him.&#8221; The pronominal suffix is a resumptive pronoun, meaning, &#8220;she says to the lacking of heart.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="97"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=688><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="98"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=689><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;heart&#8221;; cf. NIV &#8220;to those who lack judgment.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="99"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=690><b>tn</b> The construction features a cognate accusative (verb and noun from same root). The preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;</font> (<i>bet</i>) has the partitive use &#8220;some&#8221; (GKC 380 §119.<i>m</i>).</p>
<A NAME="910"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=691><b>tn</b> The final verb actually stands in a relative clause although the relative pronoun is not present; it modifies &#8220;wine.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The expressions &#8220;eat&#8221; and &#8220;drink&#8221; carry the implied comparison forward; they mean that the simple are to appropriate the teachings of wisdom.</p>
<A NAME="911"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=692><b>tn</b> There are two ways to take this word: either as &#8220;fools&#8221; or as &#8220;foolish ways.&#8221; The spelling for &#8220;foolishness&#8221; in v. 13 differs from this spelling, and so some have taken that as an indicator that this should be &#8220;fools.&#8221; But this could still be an abstract plural here as in 1:22. Either the message is to forsake fools (i.e., bad company; cf. KJV, TEV) or forsake foolishness (cf. NAB, NASB, NIV, NCV, NRSV, NLT). </p>
<A NAME="912"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=693><b>tn</b> The two imperatives are joined with <i>vav;</i> this is a volitive sequence in which result or consequence is expressed.</p>
<A NAME="913"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=694><b>tn</b> The verb means &#8220;go straight, go on, advance&#8221; or &#8220;go straight on in the way of understanding&#8221; (BDB 80 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1512;</font>).</p>
<A NAME="914"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=695><b>tn</b> The active participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1465;&#1505;&#1461;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yoser</font>) describes one who tries to correct by means of instruction and discipline; it is paralleled by the Hiphil participle which refers to someone who rebukes or reproves another. Anyone trying this on these types of people would be inviting trouble.</p>
<A NAME="915"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=696><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;receives for himself.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="916"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=697><b>tn</b> The word means &#8220;dishonor&#8221; or &#8220;disgrace.&#8221; It is paralleled with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mumo</font>), translated &#8220;abuse.&#8221; The latter term means &#8220;blemish,&#8221; although some would emend the text to read &#8220;reproach.&#8221; The MT is figurative but not impossible to interpret: Whoever tries to rebuke a wicked person will receive only insults and perhaps physical attack. </p>
<A NAME="917"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=698><b>tn</b> The verb &#8220;receives&#8221; is supplied in the translation for the sake of clarity and smoothness.</p>
<A NAME="918"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=699><b>tn</b> In view of the expected response for reproof, the text now uses a negated jussive to advise against the attempt. This is paralleled antithetically by the imperative in the second colon. This imperative is in an understood conditional clause: &#8220;if you reprove a wise person.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="919"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=700><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;lest he hate you.&#8221; The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pen</font>, &#8220;lest&#8221;) expresses fear or precaution (R. J. Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, 79, §476). The antonyms &#8220;love&#8221; and &#8220;hate&#8221; suggest that the latter means &#8220;reject&#8221; and the former means &#8220;choosing and embracing.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="920"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=701><b>tn</b> The noun &#8220;instruction&#8221; does not appear in the Hebrew text, but is supplied in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="921"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=702><b>sn</b> The parallelism shows what Proverbs will repeatedly stress, that the wise person is the righteous person.</p>
<A NAME="922"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=703><b>tn</b> The Hiphil verb normally means &#8220;to cause to know, make known&#8221;; but here the context suggests &#8220;to teach&#8221; (so many English versions).</p>
<A NAME="923"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=704><b>tn</b> The term &#8220;his&#8221; does not appear in the Hebrew text, but is supplied for the sake of smoothness and clarity.</p>
<A NAME="924"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=705><b>sn</b> The difference between <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1495;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1463;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tÿkhillat</font>) here and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1461;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">re</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">shit</font>) of 1:7, if there is any substantial difference, is that this term refers to the starting point of wisdom, and the earlier one indicates the primary place of wisdom (K&amp;D 16:202).</p>
<A NAME="925"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=706><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fear of the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="926"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=707><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;knowledge of the Holy One&#8221; (so ASV, NAB, NASB, NIV, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="927"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=708><b>tn</b> The word is in the plural in the Hebrew (literally &#8220;holy ones&#8221;; KJV &#8220;the holy&#8221;). It was translated &#8220;holy men&#8221; in <i>Tg. </i>Prov 9:10. But it probably was meant to signify the majestic nature of the <sc>Lord. As J. H. Greenstone says, he is &#8220;all-holy&#8221; (<i>Proverbs</i>, 94). This is an example of the plural of majesty, one of the honorific uses of the plural (see <i>IBHS </i>122-23 §7.4.3b).</p>
<A NAME="928"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=709><b>tn</b> The preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;</font> (<i>bet</i>) here may have the causal sense (R. J. Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, 45, §247),<i> </i>although it could also be means (Williams, 44, §243).</p>
<A NAME="929"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=710><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1505;&#1460;&#1497;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿyosifu</font>) is the Hiphil imperfect, third masculine plural; but because there is no expressed subject the verb may be taken as a passive.</p>
<A NAME="930"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=711><b>tn</b> The text simply has the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;</font> (<i>lamed</i>) with a suffix; but this will be the use of the preposition classified as &#8220;interest,&#8221; either for advantage or disadvantage (R. J. Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, 48-49, §271).</p>
<A NAME="931"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=712><b>tn</b> The perfect tense is here in a conditional clause because of the conjunction following the first colon of the verse that begins with &#8220;if.&#8221; The perfect tense then lays down the antithetical condition &#8211; &#8220;if you mock,&#8221; or &#8220;if you are a mocker.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="932"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=713><b>tn</b> The use of the imperfect tense here could be the simple future tense (cf. NASB, NRSV &#8220;you&#8230;will bear it&#8221;), but the obligatory nuance is more appropriate &#8211; &#8220;you must bear it.&#8221; These words anticipate James&#8217; warnings that the words we speak will haunt us through life (e.g., James 3:1-12). </p>
<A NAME="933"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=714><b>tc</b> The LXX has an addition: &#8220;Forsake folly, that you may reign forever; and seek discretion and direct understanding in knowledge.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="934"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=715><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a woman of foolishness.&#8221; This could be translated as &#8220;foolish woman,&#8221; taking the genitive as attributive (cf. KJV, ASV, NRSV). But in view of the contrast with the personification of wisdom, this word probably also represents a personification and so can be taken as a genitive of apposition, the woman who is folly, or &#8220;the woman, Folly&#8221; (cf. NIV). For clarity and stylistic reasons the word &#8220;called&#8221; has been supplied in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="935"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=716><b>tn</b> The meaning of the word comes close to &#8220;riotous.&#8221; W. McKane describes her as restless and rootless (<i>Proverbs </i>[OTL], 366). </p>
<A NAME="936"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=717><b>tn</b> The noun means &#8220;foolishness&#8221; (cf. KJV &#8220;simple&#8221;; NAB &#8220;inane&#8221;). Here it could be classified as a metonymy of adjunct, or as a predictive apposition (when a substantive is used in place of a noun; see R. J. Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, 15, §67).</p>
<A NAME="937"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=718><b>tn</b> The ignorance here in Proverbs must be moral ignorance. But see D. W. Thomas for the idea that the verb means &#8220;become still,&#8221; &#8220;be at rest,&#8221; yielding here the idea of restless (&#8220;A Note on <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</font> in Proverbs 9<sup>13</sup>,&#8221; <i>JTS</i> 4 [1953]: 23-24).</p>
<A NAME="938"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=719><b>tc</b> The text of v. 13 has been difficult for translators. The MT has, &#8220;The foolish woman is boisterous, simplicity, and knows not what.&#8221; The LXX reads, &#8220;A foolish and impudent woman comes to lack a morsel, she who knows not shame.&#8221; The Syriac has, &#8220;a woman lacking in discretion, seductive.&#8221; <i>Tg</i>. Prov 9:13 translates it, &#8220;a foolish woman and a gadabout, ignorant, and she knows not good.&#8221; The Vulgate has, &#8220;a woman foolish and noisy, and full of wiles, and knowing nothing at all.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="939"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=720><b>tn</b> The infinitive construct &#8220;calling out&#8221; functions epexegetically in the sentence, explaining how the previous action was accomplished.</p>
<A NAME="940"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=721><b>tn</b> The term &#8220;her&#8221; does not appear in the Hebrew text, but is supplied for the sake of clarity and smoothness.</p>
<A NAME="941"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=722><b>tn</b> The noun is a genitive of location after the construct participle. Its parallel word is also an adverbial accusative of location.</p>
<A NAME="942"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=723><b>tn</b> The participle modifies the participle in the first colon. To describe the passers-by in this context as those &#8220;who go straight&#8221; means that they are quiet and unwary.</p>
<A NAME="943"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=724><b>tn</b> This expression is almost identical to v. 4, with the exception of the addition of conjunctions in the second colon: &#8220;and the lacking of understanding and she says to him.&#8221; The parallel is deliberate, of course, showing the competing appeals for those passing by.</p>
<A NAME="944"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=725><b>sn</b> The offer is not wine and meat (which represented wisdom), but water that is stolen. The &#8220;water&#8221; will seem sweeter than wine because it is stolen &#8211; the idea of getting away with something exciting appeals to the baser instincts. In Proverbs the water imagery was introduced earlier in 5:15-19 as sexual activity with the adulteress, which would seem at the moment more enjoyable than learning wisdom. Likewise bread will be drawn into this analogy in 30:20. So the &#8220;calling out&#8221; is similar to that of wisdom, but what is being offered is very different. </p>
<A NAME="945"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=726><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;bread of secrecies.&#8221; It could mean &#8220;bread [eaten in] secret places,&#8221; a genitive of location; or it could mean &#8220;bread [gained through] secrets,&#8221; a genitive of source, the secrecies being metonymical for theft. The latter makes a better parallelism in this verse, for bread (= sexually immoral behavior) gained secretly would be like stolen water.</p>
<A NAME="946"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=727><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he does not know.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="947"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=728><b>sn</b> The &#8220;dead&#8221; are the <i>Rephaim</i>, the &#8220;shades&#8221; or dead persons who lead a shadowy existence in Sheol (e.g., Prov 2:18-19; Job 3:13-19; Ps 88:5; Isa 14:9-11). This approximates an &#8220;as-if&#8221; motif of wisdom literature: The ones ensnared in folly are as good as in Hell. See also Ptah-hotep&#8217;s sayings (<i>ANET</i> 412-414).</p>
<A NAME="948"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=729><b>tc</b> The LXX adds to the end of v. 18: &#8220;But turn away, linger not in the place, neither set your eye on her: for thus will you go through alien water; but abstain from alien water, drink not from an alien fountain, that you may live long, that years of life may be added to you.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The text has &#8220;in the depths of Sheol&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1511;&#1461;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;</font>, <font face="Scholar">bÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">imqe shÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ol</font>). The parallelism stresses that those who turn to this way of life are ignorant and doomed. It may signal a literal death lying ahead in the not too distant future, but it is more likely an analogy. The point is that the life of folly, a life of undisciplined, immoral, riotous living, runs counter to God&#8217;s appeal for wisdom and leads to ruin. That is the broad way that leads to destruction.</p>
