<A NAME="756"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=609><b>tn</b> The noun &#8220;Sheol&#8221; in parallelism to &#8220;the chambers of death&#8221; probably means the grave. The noun is a genitive of location, indicating the goal of the road(s). Her house is not the grave; it is, however, the sure way to it. </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Her house is the way to the grave. </i>The young man&#8217;s life is not destroyed in one instant; it is taken from him gradually as he enters into a course of life that will leave him as another victim of the wages of sin. The point of the warning is to prevent such a course from starting. Sin can certainly be forgiven, but the more involvement in this matter the greater the alienation from the healthy community.</p>
