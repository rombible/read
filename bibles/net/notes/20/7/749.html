<A NAME="749"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=602><b>tn</b> The present translation follows R. B. Y. Scott (<i>Proverbs, Ecclesiastes </i>[AB], 64). This third colon of the verse would usually be rendered, &#8220;fetters to the chastening of a fool&#8221; (KJV, ASV, and NASB are all similar). But there is no support that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1462;&#1499;&#1462;&#1505;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ekhes</font>) means &#8220;fetters.&#8221; It appears in Isaiah 3:16 as &#8220;anklets.&#8221; The parallelism here suggests that some animal imagery is required. Thus the ancient versions have &#8220;as a dog to the bonds.&#8221;</p>
