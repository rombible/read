<A NAME="77"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=560><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the little man in your eye.&#8221; Traditionally this Hebrew idiom is translated into English as &#8220;the apple of your eye&#8221; (so KJV, NAB, NIV, NRSV); a more contemporary rendering would be &#8220;as your most prized possession.&#8221; The word for &#8220;man&#8221; has the diminutive ending on it. It refers to the pupil, where the object focused on &#8211; a man &#8211; is reflected in miniature. The point is that the teaching must be the central focus of the disciple&#8217;s vision and attention.</p>
