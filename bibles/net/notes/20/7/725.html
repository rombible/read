<A NAME="725"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=578><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;kept secret of heart&#8221;; cf. ASV, NRSV &#8220;wily of heart.&#8221; The verbal form is the passive participle from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">natsar</font>) in construct. C. H. Toy lists the suggestions of the commentators: false, malicious, secret, subtle, excited, hypocritical (<i>Proverbs</i> [ICC], 149). The LXX has &#8220;causes the hearts of the young men to fly away.&#8221; The verb means &#8220;to guard; to watch; to keep&#8221;; to be guarded of heart means to be wily, to have secret intent &#8211; she has locked up her plans and gives nothing away (e.g., Isaiah 48:6 as well). Interestingly enough, this contrasts with her attire which gives everything away. </p>
