<A NAME="74"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=557><b>tc</b> Before v. 2 the LXX inserts: &#8220;My son, fear the <sc>Lord and you will be strong, and besides him, fear no other.&#8221; Although this addition has the precedent of 3:7 and 9 and harmonizes with 14:26, it does not fit here; the advice is to listen to the teacher.</p>
