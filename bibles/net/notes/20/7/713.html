<A NAME="713"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=566><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;strange woman.&#8221; This can be interpreted as a &#8220;wayward wife&#8221; (so NIV) or an &#8220;unfaithful wife&#8221; (so NCV). As discussed earlier, the designations &#8220;strange woman&#8221; and &#8220;foreign woman&#8221; could refer to Israelites who stood outside the community in their lawlessness and loose morals &#8211; an adulteress or wayward woman. H. Ringgren and W. Zimmerli, however, suggest that she is also a promoter of a pagan cult, but that is not entirely convincing (<i>Spruche/Prediger</i> [ATD], 19).</p>
