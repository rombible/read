<A NAME="281"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2283><b>sn</b> The line portrays the insecurity of a guilty person &#8211; he flees because he has a guilty conscience, or because he is suspicious of others around him, or because he fears judgment.</p>
<A NAME="282"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2284><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1496;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">batakh</font>) means &#8220;to trust; to be secure; to be confident.&#8221; Cf. KJV, NASB, NIV, NRSV, NLT &#8220;bold.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The righteous, who seek to find favor with God and man, have a clear conscience and do not need to look over their shoulders for avengers or law enforcers. Their position is one of confidence, so that they do not flee. </p>
<A NAME="283"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2285><b>sn</b> The Hebrew word translated &#8220;rebellious&#8221; has rebellion as its basic meaning, and that is the idea here. The proverb is describing a time when sinfulness brings about social and political unrest.</p>
<A NAME="284"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2286><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;many are its princes&#8221; (so NASB).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> In such a chaotic time there will be many rulers, either simultaneously or in a rapid sequence. The times of the judges or the days of the northern kings of Israel provide examples.</p>
<A NAME="285"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2287><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a man who understands [and] knows&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;an intelligent ruler&#8221;; NLT &#8220;wise and knowledgeable leaders.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="286"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2288><b>tc</b> The LXX reads (probably from a different underlying Hebrew text): &#8220;It is the fault of a violent man that quarrels start, but they are settled by a man of discernment.&#8221; For a survey of suggestions, see C. H. Toy, <i>Proverbs </i>(ICC), 495, and W. McKane, <i>Proverbs </i>(OTL), 630. </p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> This last line is difficult. The MT has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1461;&#1503; &#1497;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ken ya</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arikh</font>). The verb means &#8220;to prolong,&#8221; but <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ken</font>) is open to several possibilities for meaning. J. H. Greenstone&#8217;s interpretation of it as a noun from the Hollow root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kun</font>) with a meaning of &#8220;established order&#8221; is what is expected here (<i>Proverbs</i>, 293).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> For a study of the verses in chapters 28 and 29 concerning kings and governments, see B. V. Malchow, &#8220;A Manual for Future Monarchs,&#8221; <i>CBQ</i> 47 (1985): 238-45. </p>
<A NAME="287"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2289><b>tc</b> The MT reads &#8220;a poor man,&#8221; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1462;&#1489;&#1462;&#1512; &#1512;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gever rash</font>); cf. KJV, NASB, NLT. The problem is that the poor in the book of Proverbs is not an oppressor and does not have the power to be such. So commentators assume the word is incorrect. By a slight change to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rasha</font>&#8217;) the reading becomes &#8220;a wicked ruler&#8221; [<i>Heb</i> &#8220;a wicked mighty man&#8221;]. There is no textual support for this change. The LXX, however, reads, &#8220;A courageous man oppresses the poor with impieties.&#8221; If &#8220;a poor man&#8221; is retained, then the oppression would include betrayal &#8211; one would expect a poor man to have sympathy for others who are impoverished, but in fact that is not the case. It is a sad commentary on human nature that the truly oppressed people can also be oppressed by other poor people.</p>
<A NAME="288"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2290><b>tn</b> The comparative &#8220;like&#8221; does not appear in the Hebrew text, but is implied by the metaphor; it is supplied in the translation for the sake of clarity.</p>
<A NAME="289"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2291><b>sn</b> &#8220;Food&#8221; is a metonymy of effect here. The picture is of the driving rain that should cause crops to grow so that food can be produced &#8211; but does not (some English versions assume the crops are destroyed instead, e.g., NCV, TEV, CEV, NLT). The point the proverb is making is that a show of strength may not produce anything except ruin.</p>
<A NAME="2810"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2292><b>sn</b> Some commentators do not think that the word refers to the Mosaic law, but to &#8220;instruction&#8221; or &#8220;teaching&#8221; in general (cf. NCV &#8220;who disobey what they have been taught&#8221;). However, the expression &#8220;keep the law&#8221; in the second line indicates that it is binding, which would not be true of teaching in general (J. Bright, &#8220;The Apodictic Prohibition: Some Observations,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 92 [1973]: 185-204). Moreover, Proverbs 28:9 and 29:18 refer to the law, and this chapter has a stress on piety.</p>
<A NAME="2811"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2293><b>sn</b> The proverb gives the outcome and the evidence of those who forsake the law &#8211; they &#8220;praise the wicked.&#8221; This may mean (1) calling the wicked good or (2) justifying what the wicked do, for such people are no longer sensitive to evil. </p>
<A NAME="2812"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2294><b>tn</b> The verb is the Hitpael imperfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">garah</font>), which means &#8220;to stir up strife&#8221; but in this stem means &#8220;to engage in strife&#8221; (cf. NIV &#8220;resist them&#8221;). <i>Tg</i>. Prov 28:4 adds an explanatory expansion, &#8220;so as to induce them to repent.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2813"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2295><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;men of evil&#8221;; the context does not limit this to males only, however.</p>
<A NAME="2814"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2296><b>tn</b> The term translated &#8220;justice&#8221; is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1496;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mishpat</font>); it refers to the legal rights of people, decisions that are equitable in the community. W. G. Plaut observes that there are always those who think that &#8220;justice&#8221; is that which benefits them, otherwise it is not justice (<i>Proverbs</i>, 282).</p>
<A NAME="2815"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2297><b>sn</b> The contrast (and the difference) is between the wicked and those who seek the <sc>Lord. Originally the idea of seeking the <sc>Lord meant to obtain an oracle (2 Sam 21:1), but then it came to mean devotion to God &#8211; seeking to learn and do his will. Only people who are interested in doing the <sc>Lord&#8217;s will can fully understand justice. Without that standard, legal activity can become self-serving.</p>
<A NAME="2816"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2298><b>sn</b> This chapter gives a lot of attention to the contrast between the poor and the rich, assuming an integrity for the poor that is not present with the rich; the subject is addressed in vv. 6, 8, 11, 20, 22, 25, and 27 (G. A. Chutter, &#8220;Riches and Poverty in the Book of Proverbs,&#8221; <i>Crux</i> 18 [1982]: 23-28).</p>
<A NAME="2817"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2299><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term translated &#8220;ways&#8221; is in the dual, suggesting that the person has double ways, i.e., he is hypocritical. C. H. Toy does not like this idea and changes the form to the plural (<i>Proverbs </i>[ICC], 497), but his emendation is gratuitous and should be rejected.</p>
<A NAME="2818"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2300><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he is rich.&#8221; Many English versions treat this as a concessive clause (cf. KJV &#8220;though he be rich&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="2819"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2301><b>sn</b> This is another &#8220;better&#8221; saying, contrasting a poor person who has integrity with a rich person who is perverse. Of course there are rich people with integrity and perverse poor people, but that is not of interest here. If it came to the choices described here, honest poverty is better than corrupt wealth.</p>
<A NAME="2820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2302><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word could refer (1) to &#8220;instruction&#8221; by the father (cf. NCV) or (2) the Mosaic law (so most English versions). The chapter seems to be stressing religious obedience, so the referent is probably the law. Besides, the father&#8217;s teaching will be what the law demands, and the one who associates with gluttons is not abiding by the law.</p>
<A NAME="2821"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2303><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;son,&#8221; but the immediate context does not suggest limiting this only to male children.</p>
<A NAME="2822"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2304><b>sn</b> The <i>companion of gluttons</i> shames his father and his family because such a life style as he now embraces is both unruly and antisocial.</p>
<A NAME="2823"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2305><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;father,&#8221; but the immediate context does not suggest limiting this only to the male parent.</p>
<A NAME="2824"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2306><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;by interest and increase&#8221; (so ASV; NASB &#8220;by interest and usury&#8221;; NAB &#8220;by interest and overcharge.&#8221; The two words seem to be synonyms; they probably form a nominal hendiadys, meaning &#8220;by increasing [exorbitant] interest.&#8221; The law prohibited making a commission or charging interest (Exod 22:25; Lev 25:36-37; Deut 23:20; Ps 15:5). If the poor needed help, the rich were to help them &#8211; but not charge them interest. </p>
<A NAME="2825"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2307><b>tn</b> The term <b><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1461;&#1503;</font></b> (<font face="Scholar">khonen</font>, &#8220;someone who shows favor&#8221;) is the active participle. </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The verse is saying that in God&#8217;s justice wealth amassed unjustly will eventually go to the poor. God will take the wealth away from them and give it to people who will distribute it better to the poor.</p>
<A NAME="2826"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2308><b>sn</b> The expression &#8220;turn away the ear from hearing&#8221; uses a metonymy to mean that this individual will not listen &#8211; it indicates a deliberate refusal to follow the instruction of the law.</p>
<A NAME="2827"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2309><b>sn</b> It is hard to imagine how someone who willfully refuses to obey the law of God would pray according to the will of God. Such a person is more apt to pray for some physical thing or make demands on God. (Of course a prayer of repentance would be an exception and would not be an abomination to the <sc>Lord.)</p>
<A NAME="2828"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2310><b>sn</b> C. H. Toy says, &#8220;If a man, on his part, is deaf to instruction, then God, on his part, is deaf to prayer&#8221; (<i>Proverbs </i>[ICC], 499). And W. McKane observes that one who fails to attend to God&#8217;s law is a wicked person, even if he is a man of prayer (<i>Proverbs </i>[OTL], 623).</p>
<A NAME="2829"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2311><b>sn</b> The image of falling into a pit (a figure of speech known as hypocatastasis, involving implied comparison) is meant to say that the evil to which he guides people will ultimately destroy him. </p>
<A NAME="2830"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2312><b>sn</b> This proverb is teaching that those who corrupt others will be destroyed, usually by their own devices, but those who manage to avoid being corrupted will be rewarded. According to this proverb the righteous can be led astray (e.g., 26:27).</p>
<A NAME="2831"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2313><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a rich man,&#8221; although the context does not indicate that this is limited only to males.</p>
<A NAME="2832"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2314><b>sn</b> The idiom &#8220;in his own eyes&#8221; means &#8220;in his own opinion,&#8221; that is, his self conceit. The rich person thinks he is wise because he is rich, that he has made all the right choices.</p>
<A NAME="2833"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=2315><b>tn</b> The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1511;&#1456;&#1512;&#1462;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yakhqÿrennu</font>) means &#8220;he searches him&#8221; (cf. KJV, ASV) or &#8220;he examines him&#8221;; a potential imperfect nuance fits well here to indicate that a discerning person, even though poor, can search the flaws of the rich and see through the pretension and the false assumptions (cf. NAB, NASB, NIV &#8220;sees through him&#8221;). Several commentators have connected the word to the Arabic root <i>hqr</i>, which means &#8220;despise&#8221; (D. W. Thomas, &#8220;Notes on Some Passages in the Book of Proverbs,&#8221; <i>JTS</i> 38 [1937]: 400-403), but that would be both predictable and flat.</p>
<A NAME="2834"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=2316><b>tn</b> The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1465;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ba</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alots</font>) is the infinitive construct with the preposition indicating a temporal clause (&#8220;when&#8230;&#8221;); the &#8220;righteous&#8221; are the subject of this clause (subjective genitive). The word may be taken as a metonymy of adjunct &#8211; the righteous exult or rejoice because they are prosperous (cf. NLT &#8220;succeed&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="2835"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=2317><b>sn</b> &#8220;Glory&#8221; here may have the sense of elation and praise.</p>
<A NAME="2836"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=2318><b>tn</b> The meaning of &#8220;sought out&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1495;&#1467;&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yÿkhuppas</font>) indicates that people have gone into hiding. So the development of the ideas for this proverb require in the first line that &#8220;rejoice&#8221; be connected with &#8220;triumph&#8221; that means they have come to power; and in the second line that &#8220;are sought out&#8221; means people have gone into hiding (cf. ASV, NIV, NRSV, NLT). C. H. Toy thinks this is too strained; he offers this rendering: &#8220;When the righteous are exalted there is great confidence, but when the wicked come into power men hide themselves&#8221; (<i>Proverbs </i>[ICC], 500). For the verb G. R. Driver posits an Arabic cognate <i>hafasa</i>, &#8220;prostrated; trampled on&#8221; (&#8220;Problems in the Hebrew Text of Proverbs,&#8221; <i>Bib</i> 32 [1951]: 192-93), which gives a clearer result of wicked rule, but is perhaps unnecessary (e.g., Prov 28:28; 29:2). See J. A. Emerton, &#8220;Notes on Some Passages in the Book of Proverbs,&#8221; <i>JTS</i> 20 (1969): 202-20.</p>
<A NAME="2837"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=2319><b>tn</b> The Hebrew participles provide the subject matter in this contrast. On the one hand is the person who covers over (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1499;&#1463;&#1505;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">mÿkhasseh</font>) his sins. This means refusing to acknowledge them in confession, and perhaps rationalizing them away. On the other hand there is the one who both &#8220;confesses&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;&#1462;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">modeh</font>) and &#8220;forsakes&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1465;&#1494;&#1461;&#1489;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">ozev</font>) the sin. To &#8220;confess&#8221; sins means to acknowledge them, to say the same thing about them that God does.</p>
<A NAME="2838"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=2320><b>sn</b> The verse contrasts the consequences of each. The person who refuses to confess will not prosper. This is an understatement (a figure of speech known as tapeinosis); the opposite is the truth, that eventually such a person will be undone and ruined. On the other hand, the penitent will find mercy. This expression is a metonymy of cause for the effect &#8211; although &#8220;mercy&#8221; is mentioned, what mercy provides is intended, i.e., forgiveness. In other passages the verb &#8220;conceal&#8221; is used of God&#8217;s forgiveness &#8211; he covers over the iniquity (Ps 32:1). Whoever acknowledges sin, God will cover it; whoever covers it, God will lay it open.</p>
<A NAME="2839"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=2321><b>sn</b> This verse is unique in the book of Proverbs; it captures the theology of forgiveness (e.g., Pss 32 and 51). Every part of the passage is essential to the point: Confession of sins as opposed to concealing them, coupled with a turning away from them, results in mercy.</p>
<A NAME="2840"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=2322><b>tn</b> Most commentators (and some English versions, e.g., NIV) assume that the participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1508;&#1463;&#1495;&#1461;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿfakhed</font>, &#8220;fears&#8221;) means &#8220;fears the <sc>Lord,&#8221; even though &#8220;the <sc>Lord&#8221; is not present in the text. Such an assumption would be more convincing if the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yir</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">at</font>) had been used. It is possible that the verse refers to fearing sin or its consequences. In other words, the one who is always apprehensive about the nature and consequences of sin will avoid sin and find God&#8217;s blessing. Of course the assumption that the phrase means &#8220;fear the <sc>Lord&#8221; could be correct as well. There would be little difference in the outcome; in either case sin would be avoided.</p>
<A NAME="2841"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=2323><b>sn</b> The one who &#8220;hardens his heart&#8221; in this context is the person who refuses to fear sin and its consequences. The image of the &#8220;hard heart&#8221; is one of a stubborn will, unyielding and unbending (cf. NCV, TEV, NLT). This individual will fall into sin.</p>
<A NAME="2842"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=2324><b>tn</b> The term &#8220;like&#8221; is not in the Hebrew text, but is supplied in the translation for clarity and smoothness.</p>
<A NAME="2843"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=2325><b>sn</b> The comparison uses animals that are powerful, terrifying, insensitive, and in search of prey. Because political tyrants are like this, animal imagery of this sort is also used in Dan 7:1-8 for the series of ruthless world powers.</p>
<A NAME="2844"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=2326><b>sn</b> A poor nation under the control of political tyrants who are dangerous and destructive is helpless. The people of that nation will crumble under them because they cannot meet their demands and are of no use to them. </p>
<A NAME="2845"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=2327><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;A prince lacking of understanding [is] also a great oppressor&#8221; (both KJV, ASV similar) The last clause, &#8220;and a great oppressor,&#8221; appears to modify &#8220;the prince.&#8221; There is little difference in meaning, only in emphasis. The LXX has &#8220;lacks income&#8221; (reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> [<font face="Scholar">tÿvu</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ot</font>] instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> [<font face="Scholar">tÿvunot</font>]). C. H. Toy (<i>Proverbs </i>[ICC], 501) suggests deleting the word for &#8220;prince&#8221; altogether, but this emendation is gratuitous.</p>
<A NAME="2846"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=2328><b>tc</b> This follows the <i>Qere</i> reading of the participle which is singular (as opposed to the plural). The implication is that this one is also a ruler, paralleling the first half. But since he &#8220;hates&#8221; (= rejects) unjust gain he will extend [his] days, meaning he will enjoy a long and happy life (cf. NIV, NRSV, CEV).</p>
<A NAME="2847"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=2329><b>tn</b> The form is the Qal<i> </i>passive participle. The verb means &#8220;to oppress; to wrong; to extort&#8221;; here the idea of being &#8220;oppressed&#8221; would refer to the burden of a guilty conscience (hence &#8220;tormented&#8221;; cf. NAB, NRSV &#8220;burdened&#8221;). Some commentators have wanted to emend the text to read &#8220;suspected,&#8221; or &#8220;charged with,&#8221; or &#8220;given to,&#8221; etc., but if the motive is religious and not legal, then &#8220;oppressed&#8221; or &#8220;tormented&#8221; is preferred.</p>
<A NAME="2848"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=2330><b>sn</b> The text has &#8220;the blood of a life&#8221;; blood will be the metonymy of effect for the murder, the shedding of blood.</p>
<A NAME="2849"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=2331><b>tn</b> The verse is cryptic; it simply says that he will &#8220;flee to the pit.&#8221; Some have taken the &#8220;pit&#8221; to refer to the place of detention for prisoners, but why would he flee to that place? It seems rather to refer to death. This could mean that (1) since there is no place for him to go outside of the grave, he should flee to the pit (cf. TEV, NLT), or (2) he will be a fugitive until he goes to the grave (cf. NASB, NIV, NCV, NRSV, CEV). Neither one of these options is easily derived from the text. The verse seems to be saying that the one who is guilty of murder will flee, and no one should assist him. The meaning of &#8220;the pit&#8221; is unresolved.</p>
<A NAME="2850"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=2332><b>tn</b> The form is the Niphal imperfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yasha</font>&#8217;, &#8220;will be saved&#8221;). In all probability this refers to deliverance from misfortune. Some render it &#8220;kept safe&#8221; (NIV) or &#8220;will be safe&#8221; (NRSV, TEV). It must be interpreted in contrast to the corrupt person who will fall.</p>
<A NAME="2851"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=2333><b>tn</b> The Qal imperfect <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yipol</font>) is given a future translation in this context, as is the previous verb (&#8220;will be delivered&#8221;) because the working out of divine retribution appears to be coming suddenly in the future. The idea of &#8220;falling&#8221; could be a metonymy of adjunct (with the falling accompanying the ruin that comes to the person), or it may simply be a comparison between falling and being destroyed. Cf. NCV &#8220;will suddenly be ruined&#8221;; NLT &#8220;will be destroyed.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2852"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=2334><b>tn</b> The last word in the verse, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ekhat</font>), means &#8220;in one [= at once (?)].&#8221; This may indicate a sudden fall, for falling &#8220;in one&#8221; (the literal meaning) makes no sense. W. McKane wishes to emend the text to read &#8220;into a pit&#8221; based on v. 10b (<i>Proverbs </i>[OTL], 622); this emendation is followed by NAB, NRSV.</p>
<A NAME="2853"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=2335><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;will have plenty of food&#8221; (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;bread&#8221;); so NAB, NASB, NCV.</p>

The proverb is essentially the same as Prov 12:11 except for the last expression.</p>
<A NAME="2855"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=2337><b>tn</b> The repetition of the verb strengthens the contrast. Both halves of the verse use the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yisba</font>&#8217;, &#8220;will be satisfied; will be filled with; will have enough&#8221;). It is positive in the first colon, but negative in the second &#8211; with an ironic twist to say one is &#8220;satisfied&#8221; with poverty.</p>
<A NAME="2856"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=2338><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a man of faithfulness,&#8221; although the context does not indicate this should be limited only to males.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The text does not qualify the nature of the faithfulness. While this would certainly have implications for the person&#8217;s righteous acts, its primary meaning may be his diligence and reliability in his work. His faithful work will bring the returns.</p>
<A NAME="2857"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=2339><b>sn</b> The proverb is not rebuking diligent labor. One who is eager to get rich quickly is the opposite of the faithful person. The first person is faithful to God and to the covenant community; the second is trying to get rich as quickly as possible, at the least without doing an honest day&#8217;s work and at the worst dishonestly. In a hurry to gain wealth, he falls into various schemes and will pay for it. <i>Tg</i>. Prov 28:20 interprets this to say he hastens through deceit and wrongdoing.</p>
<A NAME="2858"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=2340><b>tn</b> The construction uses the Hiphil infinitive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1461;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hakken</font>) as the subject of the sentence: &#8220;to have respect for [or, recognize] persons is not good&#8221; (e.g., 24:23; 18:5; Deut 1:17; Lev 19:15). Such favoritism is &#8220;not good&#8221;; instead, it is a miscarriage of justice and is to be avoided.</p>
<A NAME="2859"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=2341><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;not good.&#8221; This is a figure of speech known as tapeinosis &#8211; a deliberate understatement to emphasize a worst-case scenario: &#8220;it is terrible!&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2860"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=2342><b>tn</b> The meaning and connection of the line is not readily clear. It could be taken in one of two ways: (1) a person can steal even a small piece of bread if hungry, and so the court should show some compassion, or it should show no partiality even in such a pathetic case; (2) a person could be bribed for a very small price (a small piece of bread being the figure representing this). This second view harmonizes best with the law. </p>
<A NAME="2861"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=2343><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;a man with an evil eye&#8221; (as opposed to the generous man who has a &#8220;good&#8221; eye). This individual is selfish, unkind, unsympathetic to others. He looks only to his own gain. Cf. NAB &#8220;The avaricious man&#8221;; NLT &#8220;A greedy person.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2862"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=2344><b>sn</b> The one who is hasty to gain wealth is involved in sin in some way, for which he will be punished by poverty.

<A NAME="2863"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=2345><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;rebukes&#8221; (NAB, NASB, NIV, NRSV).</p>

C. H. Toy suggests simply changing it to &#8220;after&#8221; or &#8220;afterward,&#8221; i.e., &#8220;in the end&#8221; (<i>Proverbs </i>[ICC], 504), a solution most English versions adopt. G. R. Driver suggested an Akkadian cognate <i>ahurru</i>, &#8220;common man,&#8221; reading &#8220;as a rebuker an ordinary man&#8221; (&#8220;Hebrew Notes,&#8221; <i>ZAW</i> 52 [1934]: 147).</p>
<A NAME="2866"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=2348><b>tn</b> The construction uses the Hiphil participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">makhaliq</font>, &#8220;makes smooth&#8221;) followed by the adverbial accusative of means, the metonymy &#8220;tongue&#8221; &#8211; he makes what he says smooth. This will be pleasing for the moment, but it will offer no constructive help like the rebuke would. </p>
<A NAME="2867"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=2349><b>sn</b> While the expression is general enough to cover any kind of robbery, the point seems to be that because it can be rationalized it may refer to prematurely trying to gain control of the family property through some form of pressure and in the process reducing the parents&#8217; possessions and standing in the community. The culprit could claim what he does is not wrong because the estate would be his anyway.</p>
<A NAME="2868"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">68</span><note=2350><b>sn</b> The metaphor of &#8220;companion&#8221; here means that a person who would do this is just like the criminally destructive person. It is as if they were working together, for the results are the same.</p>

It would mean &#8220;wide of appetite&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1489;&#1470;&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font>), thus &#8220;greedy.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2871"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=2353><b>sn</b> Greed &#8220;stirs up&#8221; the strife. This individual&#8217;s attitude and actions stir up dissension because people do not long tolerate him.</p>

<A NAME="2873"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">73</span><note=2355><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">dashen</font>) means &#8220;to be fat,&#8221; and in the Piel<i>/</i>Pual stems &#8220;to make fat/to be made fat&#8221; (cf.

NRSV &#8220;will be enriched&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="2874"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">74</span><note=2356><b>sn</b> The idea of &#8220;trusting in one&#8217;s own heart&#8221; is a way of describing one who is self-reliant. C. H. Toy says it means to follow the untrained suggestions of the mind or to rely on one&#8217;s own mental resources (<i>Proverbs </i>[ICC], 505). It is arrogant to take no counsel but to rely only on one&#8217;s own intelligence.</p>
<A NAME="2875"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">75</span><note=2357><b>sn</b> The idiom of &#8220;walking in wisdom&#8221; means to live life according to the acquired skill and knowledge passed on from the sages.

<A NAME="2876"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">76</span><note=2358><b>tn</b> The verb form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1461;&#1496;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yimmalet</font>) is the Niphal imperfect; the form means &#8220;to escape.&#8221; In this context one would conclude that it means &#8220;to escape from trouble,&#8221; because the one who lives in this life by wisdom will escape trouble, and the one who trusts in himself will not.</p>
<A NAME="2877"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">77</span><note=2359><b>sn</b> The generous individual will be rewarded. He will not lack nor miss what he has given away to the poor.</p>

Hiding or closing the eyes is a metonymy of cause or of adjunct, indicating a decision not to look on and thereby help the poor. It could also be taken as an implied comparison, i.e., not helping the poor is like closing the eyes to them.</p>
<A NAME="2879"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">79</span><note=2361><b>tn</b> The term &#8220;receives&#8221; is not in the Hebrew text but is implied, and is supplied in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="2880"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">80</span><note=2362><b>sn</b> The text does not specify the nature or the source of the curses. It is natural to think that they would be given by the poor who are being mistreated and ignored.

<A NAME="2881"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">81</span><note=2363><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the wicked rise,&#8221; referring to an accession to power, as in a government. Cf.

<A NAME="2882"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">82</span><note=2364><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a man&#8221; or &#8220;mankind&#8221; in a generic sense.</p>

G. R. Driver suggests the Akkadian <i>sataru</i> instead, which means &#8220;to demolish,&#8221; and is cognate to the Aramaic &#8220;to destroy.&#8221; This would produce the idea that people are &#8220;destroyed&#8221; when the wicked come to power (&#8220;Problems in the Hebrew Text of Proverbs,&#8221; <i>Bib</i> 32 [1951]: 192-93). That meaning certainly fits the idea, but there is no reason for the change because the MT is perfectly readable as it is and makes good sense.</p>
<A NAME="2884"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">84</span><note=2366><b>tn</b> The two clauses have parallel constructions: They both begin with infinitives construct with prepositions functioning as temporal clauses, followed by subjective genitives (first the wicked, and then the pronoun referring to them). This heightens the antithesis: &#8220;when the wicked rise&#8230;when they perish.&#8221;</p>
