<A NAME="291"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=2367><b>tn</b> The idiom &#8220;to harden the neck&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1511;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1492;&#1470;&#1506;&#1465;&#1512;&#1462;&#1507;</font>, <font face="Scholar">maqsheh-</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">oref</font>) is the idea of resisting the rebukes and persisting in obstinacy (e.g., Exod 32:9). The opposite of a &#8220;stiff neck&#8221; would be the bending back, i.e., submission.</p>
<A NAME="292"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2368><b>tn</b> The Hebrew construction is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1499;&#1464;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ish tokhakhot</font>, &#8220;a man of rebukes&#8221;), meaning &#8220;a man who has (or receives) many rebukes.&#8221; This describes a person who is deserving of punishment and who has been given many warnings. The text says, then, &#8220;a man of rebukes hardening himself.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="293"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=2369><b>sn</b> The stubborn person refuses to listen; he <i>will suddenly be destroyed</i> when the calamity strikes (e.g., Prov 6:15; 13:18; 15:10).</p>
<A NAME="294"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=2370><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;healing&#8221; (NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="295"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=2371><b>tn</b> The Hebrew form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">birvot</font>) is the Qal infinitive construct of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ravah</font>) with a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;</font> (<i>bet</i>) preposition, forming a temporal clause with a subjective genitive following it. It is paralleled in the second colon by the same construction, showing the antithesis: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">uvimshol</font>), &#8220;and when the wicked rule.&#8221; Some commentators wish to change the first verb to make it parallel this more closely, e.g., <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">radah</font>, &#8220;to rule&#8221;), but that would be too neat and is completely unsupported. The contrast is between when the righteous increase and when the wicked rule. It is not hard to see how this contrast works out in society.</p>
<A NAME="296"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=2372><b>tn</b> The Niphal<i> </i>verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1504;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">anakh</font>) means &#8220;to sigh; to groan,&#8221; usually because of grief or physical and emotional distress. The word is a metonymy of effect; the cause is the oppression and distress due to evil rulers.</p>
<A NAME="297"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=2373><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a man.&#8221; Here &#8220;man&#8221; is retained in the translation because the second colon mentions prostitutes.</p>
<A NAME="298"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=2374><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;causes his father to rejoice&#8221;; NAB &#8220;makes his father glad.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="299"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=2375><b>tn</b> The active participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1465;&#1506;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ro</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">eh</font>) is from the second root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>), meaning &#8220;to associate with.&#8221; The verb occurs only a few times, and mostly in the book of Proverbs. It is related to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1461;&#1506;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">re</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">eh</font>, &#8220;friend; companion; fellow&#8221;). To describe someone as a &#8220;companion&#8221; or &#8220;friend&#8221; of prostitutes is somewhat euphemistic; it surely means someone who is frequently engaging the services of prostitutes.</p>
<A NAME="2910"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=2376><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">abbed</font>) means &#8220;destroys&#8221;; it is the Piel imperfect of the verb that means &#8220;to perish.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="2911"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=2377><b>sn</b> <i>Wealth</i> was seen as a sign of success and of God&#8217;s blessings, pretty much as it always has been. To be seen as honorable in the community meant one had acquired some substance and kept his reputation. It would be a disgrace to the family to have a son who squandered his money on prostitutes (e.g., Prov 5:10; 6:31).</p>
<A NAME="2912"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2378><b>tn</b> The form is the Hiphil imperfect of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">amad</font>, &#8220;to stand&#8221;), hence, &#8220;to cause to stand.&#8221; It means that the king makes the nation &#8220;stand firm,&#8221; with &#8220;standing firm&#8221; being a figure for strength, security, and stability. Cf. NCV &#8220;makes his country (the nation CEV) strong.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2913"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=2379><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;country.&#8221; This term functions as a metonymy of subject for the people in the land.</p>
<A NAME="2914"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=2380><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ish tÿrumot</font>, &#8220;a man of offerings&#8221;), which could refer to a man who &#8220;receives gifts&#8221; or &#8220;gives gifts.&#8221; Because of its destructive nature on the country, here the phrase must mean that he receives or &#8220;exacts&#8221; the money (cf. NRSV &#8220;makes heavy exactions&#8221;). This seems to go beyond the ordinary taxation for two reasons: (1) this ruler is a &#8220;man of offerings,&#8221; indicating that it is in his nature to do this, and (2) it tears down the country. The word &#8220;offerings&#8221; has been taken to refer to gifts or bribes (cf. NASB, NIV, CEV, NLT), but the word itself suggests more the idea of tribute or taxes that are demanded; this Hebrew word was used in Leviticus for offerings given to the priests, and in Ezek 45:16 for taxes. The point seems to be that this ruler or administrator is breaking the backs of the people with heavy taxes or tribute (e.g., 1 Sam 8:11-18), and this causes division and strife.</p>
<A NAME="2915"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=2381><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a man,&#8221; but the context here does not suggest that the proverb refers to males only.</p>
<A NAME="2916"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=2382><b>tn</b> The form is the Hiphil participle, literally &#8220;deals smoothly,&#8221; i.e., smoothing over things that should be brought to one&#8217;s attention. </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The flatterer is too smooth; his words are intended to gratify. In this proverb some malice is attached to the flattery, for the words prove to be destructive.</p>
<A NAME="2917"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=2383><b>sn</b> The image of &#8220;spreading a net&#8221; for someone&#8217;s steps is an implied comparison (a figure of speech known as hypocatastasis): As one would literally spread a net, this individual&#8217;s flattery will come back to destroy him. A net would be spread to catch the prey, and so the idea is one of being caught and destroyed.</p>
<A NAME="2918"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=2384><b>tn</b> There is some ambiguity concerning the referent of &#8220;his steps.&#8221; The net could be spread for the one flattered (cf. NRSV, &#8220;a net for the neighbor&#8217;s feet&#8221;; NLT, &#8220;their feet,&#8221; referring to others), or for the flatterer himself (cf. TEV &#8220;you set a trap for yourself&#8221;). The latter idea would make the verse more powerful: In flattering someone the flatterer is getting himself into a trap (e.g., 2:16; 7:5; 26:28; 28:23).</p>
<A NAME="2919"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2385><b>tn</b> The Syriac and <i>Tg</i>. Prov 29:6 simplify the meaning by writing it with a passive verb: &#8220;the evil man is ensnared by his guilt.&#8221; The metaphor of the snare indicates that the evil person will be caught in his own transgression.</p>
<A NAME="2920"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=2386><b>tc</b> The two verbs create some difficulty because the book of Proverbs does not usually duplicate verbs like this and because the first verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yarun</font>) is irregular. The <i>BHS</i> editors prefer to emend it to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yaruts</font>, &#8220;will rush&#8221;; cf. NAB &#8220;runs on joyfully&#8221;). W. McKane emends it to &#8220;exult&#8221; to form a hendiadys: &#8220;is deliriously happy&#8221; (<i>Proverbs </i>[OTL], 638). G. R. Driver suggests changing the word to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yadon</font>) based on two Hebrew <sc>mss and an Arabic cognate <i>dana</i>, &#8220;continue.&#8221; He translates it &#8220;but the righteous remains and rejoices&#8221; (&#8220;Problems in the Hebrew Text of Proverbs,&#8221; <i>Bib</i> 32 [1951]: 193-94). None of these changes are particularly helpful. The verb is unusual for a geminate root, but Gesenius shows several places where the same pattern can be seen in other geminate verbs (GKC 180 §67.<i>q</i>). In light of this it is preferable to retain the reading of the MT here.</p>
<A NAME="2921"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=2387><b>sn</b> These two verbs express the confidence of the righteous &#8211; they have no fears and so can sing. So the proverb is saying that only the righteous can enjoy a sense of security.</p>
<A NAME="2922"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=2388><b>tn</b> The form is an active participle, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1465;&#1491;&#1461;&#1506;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yodea</font>&#8217;); it describes the righteous as &#8220;knowing, caring for, having sympathetic knowledge for, or considering favorably&#8221; the legal needs of the poor. Cf. NAB &#8220;has a care for&#8221;; NASB &#8220;is concerned for.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2923"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=2389><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word used here is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">din</font>), which typically means &#8220;judgment,&#8221; but can also mean &#8220;strife&#8221; and &#8220;cause.&#8221; Here it refers to the &#8220;cause&#8221; of the poor (so KJV, ASV), their plea, their case, their legal rights. A righteous person is sympathetic to this.</p>
<A NAME="2924"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=2390><b>tn</b> The term &#8220;such&#8221; is supplied in the translation for clarification. It is not simply any knowledge that the wicked do not understand, but the knowledge mentioned in the first colon. They do not understand the &#8220;sympathetic knowledge&#8221; or &#8220;concern&#8221; for the cause of the poor.</p>
<A NAME="2925"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=2391><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;men of scorn&#8221;; NAB &#8220;Arrogant men&#8221;; ASV, NRSV &#8220;Scoffers&#8221;; NIV, NLT &#8220;Mockers.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2926"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2392><b>tn</b> The verb means &#8220;to blow; to breathe&#8221; (BDB 806 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font>). In the Hiphil imperfect its meaning here is &#8220;to excite; to inflame&#8221; a city, as in blowing up a flame or kindling a fire. It is also used with &#8220;words&#8221; in 6:19 and 12:17 &#8211; they &#8220;puff out words.&#8221; Such scornful people make dangerous situations worse, whereas the wise calm things down (e.g., 2 Sam 20).</p>
<A NAME="2927"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=2393><b>tn</b> The term &#8220;city&#8221; is a metonymy of subject; it refers to the people in the city who can easily be set in an uproar by such scornful people.</p>
<A NAME="2928"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2394><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a wise man&#8230;a foolish man.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2929"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2395><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1496;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shafat</font>) means &#8220;to judge.&#8221; In the Niphal stem it could be passive, but is more frequently reciprocal: &#8220;to enter into controversy&#8221; or &#8220;to go to court.&#8221; The word is usually used in connection with a lawsuit (so many recent English versions), but can also refer to an argument (e.g., 1 Sam 12:7; Isa 43:26); cf. NAB &#8220;disputes&#8221;; NASB &#8220;has a controversy.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2930"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=2396><b>tn</b> The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nakhat</font>) is a derivative of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nuakh</font>, &#8220;to rest&#8221;) and so means &#8220;quietness&#8221; or &#8220;rest,&#8221; i.e., &#8220;peace.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The proverb is saying that there will be no possibility of settling the matter in a calm way, no matter what mood the fool is in (e.g., Prov 26:4). R. N. Whybray says one can only cut the losses and have no further dealings with the fool (<i>Proverbs </i>[CBC], 168). </p>
<A NAME="2931"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2397><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and he is angry and he laughs.&#8221; The construction uses the conjunctive <i>vav</i> to express alternate actions: &#8220;whether&#8230;or.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2932"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2398><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;men of bloods.&#8221; The Hebrew word for &#8220;blood&#8221; is written in the plural to reflect the shedding of blood. So the expression &#8220;men of bloods&#8221; means people who shed blood &#8211; murderers, bloodthirsty men, or those who would not hesitate to commit murder in order to get what they want.</p>
<A NAME="2933"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=2399><b>sn</b> The Hebrew word describes the &#8220;blameless&#8221; or &#8220;innocent&#8221; who maintain integrity. The bloodthirsty despise people who insist on decency and integrity.</p>
<A NAME="2934"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=2400><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and the upright seek his life.&#8221; There are two ways this second line can be taken. (1) One can see it as a continuation of the first line, meaning that the bloodthirsty men also &#8220;seek the life of the upright&#8221; (cf. NIV, NRSV). The difficulty is that the suffix is singular but the apparent referent is plural. (2) One can take it is as a contrast: &#8220;but as for the upright, they seek his life&#8221; &#8211; a fairly straightforward rendering (cf. ASV). The difficulty here is that &#8220;seeking a life&#8221; is normally a hostile act, but it would here be positive: &#8220;seeking&#8221; a life to preserve it. The verse would then say that the bloodthirsty hate the innocent, but the righteous protect them (W. McKane, <i>Proverbs </i>[OTL], 637; cf. NAB, NASB, TEV).</p>
<A NAME="2935"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=2401><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;his spirit.&#8221; It has been commonly interpreted to mean &#8220;his anger&#8221; (ASV, NAB, NIV, NRSV), but it probably means more than that. The fool gives full expression to his &#8220;soul,&#8221; whether it is anger or bitterness or frustration or any other emotions. He has no self-control.</p>
<A NAME="2936"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=2402><b>tn</b> The line is difficult. The MT has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1488;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512; &#1497;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1495;&#1462;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">khor yÿshabbÿkhennah</font>), which literally means &#8220;steals it back.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shavakh</font>) means &#8220;to soothe; to still,&#8221; as with a storm, or here with the temper. But because <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">akhor</font>) does not fit very well with this verb, most commentators offer some suggested change. C. H. Toy reads &#8220;anger&#8221; instead of &#8220;back&#8221; and translates the verb &#8220;restrain&#8221; following the LXX, which has &#8220;self-control&#8221; (<i>Proverbs </i>[ICC], 510). The idea of self-control is what is intended, but the changes suggested are not entirely warranted. A number of English versions have &#8220;holds it back&#8221; (e.g., NASB, NRSV, NLT), and this fits the Hebrew as well as any.</p>
<A NAME="2937"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=2403><b>tn</b> The Hiphil participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1511;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">maqshiv</font>) means &#8220;to give attention to; to regard; to heed.&#8221; Cf. NASB, NCV, TEV &#8220;pays attention to.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Such a ruler would become known as one who could be lied to, because he paid attention to lies.</p>
<A NAME="2938"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=2404><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;word of falsehood&#8221; or &#8220;lying word.&#8221; Cf. TEV &#8220;false information.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2939"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=2405><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sharat</font>) means &#8220;to minister; to serve.&#8221; The Piel plural participle here refers to servants of the king who attend to him &#8211; courtiers and ministers (cf. NIV, NRSV, TEV, CEV &#8220;officials&#8221;; NLT &#8220;advisers&#8221;). This, his entourage, will have to resort to evil practices to gain his favor if he is swayed by such lies.</p>
<A NAME="2940"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=2406><b>sn</b> The servants of the monarch adjust to their ruler; when they see that court flattery and deception are effective, they will begin to practice it and in the end become wicked (e.g., Prov 16:10; 20:8; 25:2).</p>
<A NAME="2941"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=2407><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;a man of oppressions&#8221;; KJV &#8220;the deceitful man.&#8221; The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1465;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tokh</font>) means &#8220;injury; oppression&#8221; (BDB 1067 s.v.). Such men were usually the rich and powerful. The Greek and the Latin versions have &#8220;the debtor and creditor.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2942"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=2408><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1490;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pagash</font>) means &#8220;to meet; to encounter.&#8221; In the Niphal it means &#8220;to meet each other; to meet together&#8221; (cf. KJV, ASV). The focus in this passage is on what they share in common.</p>
<A NAME="2943"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=2409><b>sn</b> The expression <i>gives light to the eyes</i> means &#8220;gives them sight&#8221; (cf. NIV). The expression means that by giving them sight the <sc>Lord gives them the light of life (e.g., Job 33:30; Ps 13:3). God creates and controls them all.

Some have interpreted this to mean &#8220;faithfully&#8221; (KJV, ASV) but that is somewhat unclear. The idea is that the poor must be treated fairly and justly (cf. NIV &#8220;with fairness&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;with equity&#8221;); &#8220;truth&#8221; is that which corresponds to the standard of the law revealed by God.

<A NAME="2945"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=2411><b>sn</b> The term &#8220;throne&#8221; is a metonymy of subject; it represents the dynasty, the reign of this particular king and his descendants.

<A NAME="2951"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=2417><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ravah</font>), which is repeated twice in this line, means &#8220;to increase.&#8221; The first occurrence here is usually taken to mean that when the wicked increase they hold the power (cf. NRSV, NLT &#8220;are in authority&#8221;; TEV, CEV &#8220;are in power&#8221;). The text does not explain the details, only that when the wicked increase sin will increase in the land.</p>
<A NAME="2952"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=2418><b>sn</b> The Hebrew verb translated &#8220;see&#8221; in this context indicates a triumph: The righteous will gaze with satisfaction, or they will look on the downfall of the wicked triumphantly (e.g., Pss 37:4 and 112:8). The verse is teaching that no matter how widespread evil may be, the righteous will someday see its destruction.</p>
<A NAME="2953"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=2419><b>tn</b> The verb, a Hiphil imperfect with a suffix, could be subordinated to the preceding imperative to form a purpose clause (indirect volitive classification): &#8220;that he may give you rest.&#8221; The same then could apply to the second part of the verse.</p>

<A NAME="2955"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=2421><b>sn</b> The parallelism of this verse is synthetic; the second half adds the idea of &#8220;delight/pleasure&#8221; to that of &#8220;rest.&#8221; So a disciplined child will both relieve anxiety (&#8220;give&#8230;rest&#8221;) and bring happiness to the parents.</p>
<A NAME="2956"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=2422><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;no vision.&#8221; The Hebrew word &#8220;vision&#8221; (from the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1494;&#1464;&#1492;</font> [<font face="Scholar">khazah</font>, &#8220;to see&#8221;]) refers to divine communication to prophets (as in 1 Sam 3:1) and not to individual goals or plans. C. H. Toy sees a problem here: The most calamitous period of Israel&#8217;s history was when prophetic vision was at its height, whereas people were often more obedient when God was silent. He also notes that in the book of Proverbs there is no mention of prophetic teaching with wisdom as a guide. So he emends the word to &#8220;guidance&#8221; following the LXX (<i>Proverbs </i>[ICC], 512). The TEV has &#8220;guidance&#8221;; the NIV retains &#8220;revelation.&#8221; It must be stated that the prophetic ministry was usually in response to the calamitous periods, calling the people back to God. Without them the downward rush to anarchy and destruction would have been faster than with these prophetic calls from God.</p>
<A NAME="2957"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=2423><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">para</font>&#8217;) means &#8220;to let go; to let alone.&#8221; It occurs here in the Niphal with the meaning of &#8220;[the people] are let loose,&#8221; meaning, they cast off restraint (e.g., Exod 32:25). Cf. NLT &#8220;run wild.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2958"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=2424><b>sn</b> <i>The law</i> here refers to scripture, the concrete form of revelation. So the two halves of the verse provide the contrast: When there is no prophetic revelation there is chaos, but those who keep the revelation contained in scripture find blessing.</p>
<A NAME="2959"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=2425><b>tn</b> There is a tendency among commentators and English versions to translate <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ashrehu</font>) as &#8220;happy is he!&#8221; (cf. KJV, ASV, NAB, NASB, TEV, NLT). But &#8220;happy&#8221; can be a misleading translation. The Hebrew word refers to a heavenly bliss, an inner joy, that comes from knowing one is right with God and experiencing his blessing. &#8220;Happiness,&#8221; on the other hand, depends on what happens.</p>
<A NAME="2960"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=2426><b>sn</b> Servants could not be corrected by mere words; they had to be treated like children for they were frequently unresponsive.

<A NAME="2961"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=2427><b>tn</b> The Niphal imperfect here is best rendered as a potential imperfect &#8211; &#8220;cannot be corrected.&#8221; The second line of the verse clarifies that even though the servant understands the words, he does not respond.

<A NAME="2965"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=2431><b>sn</b> The focus of this proverb is on someone who is <i>hasty in his words</i>. This is the person who does not stop to think, but acts on the spur of the moment. To speak before thinking is foolishness. </p>
<A NAME="2966"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=2432><b>sn</b> Rash speech cannot easily be remedied. The prospects for a fool are better (e.g., Prov 26:12).</p>
<A NAME="2967"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=2433><b>tn</b> There is no conditional particle at the beginning of the verse; however, the relationship of the clauses, which lay down the condition first and then (with a <i>vav</i>) the consequences, indicates a conditional construction here. Cf. also NAB, NIV, NCV, TEV.</p>
<A NAME="2968"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">68</span><note=2434><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1490;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">magon</font>) is a <i>hapax legomenon</i>; accordingly, it has been given a variety of interpretations. The LXX has &#8220;grief,&#8221; and this has been adopted by some versions (e.g., NIV, NCV). The idea would be that treating the servant too easily for so long would not train him at all, so he will be of little use, and therefore a grief. J. Reider takes the word to mean &#8220;weakling&#8221; from the Arabic root <i>na&#8217;na</i> (&#8220;to be weak&#8221;), with a noun/adjective form <i>muna&#8217;ana&#8217;</i> (&#8220;weak; feeble&#8221;); see his &#8220;Etymological Studies in Biblical Hebrew,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 4 [1954]: 276-95. This would give a different emphasis to the sentence, but on the whole not very different than the first. In both cases the servant will not be trained well. Rashi, a Jewish scholar who lived <sc>a.d. 1040-1105, had the translation &#8220;a master.&#8221; The servant trained this way will assume authority in the household even as the son. This may be behind the KJV translation &#8220;son&#8221; (likewise ASV, NASB). <i>Tg</i>. Prov 29:21 and the Syriac have &#8220;to be uprooted,&#8221; which may reflect a different text entirely.</p>

Not only does the angry person stir up dissension, but he also frequently causes sin in himself and in others (e.g., 14:17, 29; 15:18; 16:32; 22:24).</p>

The contrast works well: The proud will be brought &#8220;low,&#8221; but the one who is &#8220;lowly&#8221; will be honored. In this instance the wordplay can be preserved in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="2974"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">74</span><note=2440><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;low in spirit&#8221;; KJV &#8220;humble in spirit.&#8221; This refers to an attitude of humility. </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The Hebrew word translated &#8220;lowly&#8221; forms an implied comparison: To be humble is like being low, base, earthbound; whereas pride is often compared to being high, lofty &#8211; at least in one&#8217;s own eyes.</p>

Lev 5:1). However, in this legal setting referring to &#8220;a victim&#8217;s curse&#8221; could be misleading (cf. also KJV &#8220;he heareth cursing&#8221;), since it could be understood to refer to profanity directed against those guilty of the crime rather than an imprecation called down on a witness who refused to testify (as in the present proverb). The present translation specifies this as an &#8220;oath to testify.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The <i>oath to testify</i> was not an oath to tell the truth before a court of law in the modern sense.

According to Lev 5:1, if a witness does not speak up he is accountable for the crime. This person hears the adjuration, but if he speaks up he is condemned, and if he does not speak up he is guilty under the law. The proverb is an unusual one; it seems to be warning against getting mixed up in any way with the thief, for it will create a serious ethical dilemma. </p>
<A NAME="2978"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">78</span><note=2444><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the fear of man.&#8221; This uses an objective genitive to describe a situation where fearing what people might do or think controls one&#8217;s life.
