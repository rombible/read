<A NAME="1650"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=1375><b>tn</b> The expression uses an implied comparison, comparing &#8220;wrath&#8221; to a messenger because it will send a message. The qualification is &#8220;death,&#8221; an objective genitive, meaning the messenger will bring death, or the message will be about death. E.g., 1 Kgs 2:25, 29-34 and 46. Some have suggested a comparison with the two messengers of Baal to the god Mot (&#8220;Death&#8221;) in the Ugaritic tablets (H. L. Ginsberg, &#8220;Baal&#8217;s Two Messengers,&#8221; <i>BASOR</i> 95 [1944]: 25-30). If there is an allusion, it is a very slight one. The verse simply says that the king&#8217;s wrath threatens death. </p>
