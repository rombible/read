<A NAME="1673"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">73</span><note=1398><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;sweetness of lips.&#8221; The term &#8220;lips&#8221; is a metonymy of cause, meaning what is said. It is a genitive of specification. The idea of &#8220;sweetness&#8221; must be gracious and friendly words. The teaching will be well-received because it is both delightful and persuasive (cf. NIV &#8220;pleasant words promote instruction&#8221;). </p>
