<A NAME="1659"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=1384><b>sn</b> The second half of the verse uses two different words for &#8220;guard&#8221;; this one is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1465;&#1510;&#1461;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">notser</font>) &#8220;the one who guards his way,&#8221; and the first is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1502;&#1461;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shomer</font>) &#8220;the one who guards his life&#8221; (the order of the words is reversed in the translation). The second colon then explains further the first (synthetic parallelism), because to guard one&#8217;s way preserves life. </p>
