<A NAME="1678"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">78</span><note=1403><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the discipline of fools [is] folly.&#8221; The &#8220;discipline&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1464;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">musar</font>) in this proverb is essentially a requital for sin (hence &#8220;punishment,&#8221; so NIV, NCV, NRSV); discipline which is intended to correct is normally rejected and despised by fools. So the line is saying that there is very little that can be done for or with the fool (cf. NLT &#8220;discipline is wasted on fools&#8221;).</p>
