<A NAME="1648"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1373><b>sn</b> This proverb introduces the danger of becoming a victim of the king&#8217;s wrath (cf. CEV &#8220;if the king becomes angry, someone may die&#8221;). A wise person knows how to pacify the unexpected and irrational behavior of a king. The proverb makes the statement, and then gives the response to the subject.</p>
