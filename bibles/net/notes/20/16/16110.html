<A NAME="16110"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">110</span><note=1435><b>tn</b> One who is &#8220;slow to anger&#8221; is a patient person (cf. NAB, NIV, NLT). This is explained further in the parallel line by the description of &#8220;one who rules his spirit&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;</font>, <font face="Scholar">umoshel bÿrukho</font>), meaning &#8220;controls his temper.&#8221; This means the person has the emotions under control and will not &#8220;fly off the handle&#8221; quickly.</p>
