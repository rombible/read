<A NAME="16107"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">107</span><note=1432><b>sn</b> The proverb presents the ideal, for it is not concerned with old people who may be evil. The KJV tried to qualify the interpretation by making the second half of the verse a conditional clause (&#8220;if it be found in the way of righteousness&#8221;). This is acceptable but unnecessary. The book of Proverbs is simply laying out the equity of longevity for righteousness and premature death for wicked people. In this line &#8220;gray hair&#8221; is a metonymy of adjunct/effect, representing old age; and the &#8220;glorious crown&#8221; (taking the genitive as attributive) provides a fitting metaphor to compare the hair on the head with a crown. </p>
