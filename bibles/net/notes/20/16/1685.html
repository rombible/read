<A NAME="1685"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">85</span><note=1410><b>sn</b> Two predicates are added to qualify the metaphor: The pleasant words are &#8220;sweet&#8221; and &#8220;healing.&#8221; &#8220;Soul&#8221; includes in it the appetites, physical and spiritual; and so sweet to the &#8220;soul&#8221; would summarize all the ways pleasant words give pleasure. &#8220;Bones&#8221; is a metonymy of subject, the boney framework representing the whole person, body and soul. Pleasant words, like honey, will enliven and encourage the whole person. One might recall, in line with the imagery here, how Jonathan&#8217;s eyes brightened when he ate from the honeycomb (1 Sam 14:27).</p>
