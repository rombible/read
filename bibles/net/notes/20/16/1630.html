<A NAME="1630"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1355><b>sn</b> The lines contrast the modest income with the abundant income; but the real contrast is between righteousness and the lack of justice (or injustice). &#8220;Justice&#8221; is used for both legal justice and ethical conduct. It is contrasted with righteousness in 12:5 and 21:7; it describes ethical behavior in 21:3. Here the point is that unethical behavior tarnishes the great gain and will be judged by God. </p>
