<A NAME="1669"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">69</span><note=1394><b>tn</b> Although traditionally this word is translated &#8220;happy&#8221; (cf. KJV, ASV, NAB, NRSV, NLT), such a translation can be misleading because the word means far more than that. It describes the heavenly bliss that comes from knowing one is right with God and following God&#8217;s precepts. The &#8220;blessed&#8221; could be at odds with the world (Ps 1:1-3). </p>
