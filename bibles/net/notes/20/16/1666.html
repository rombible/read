<A NAME="1666"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=1391><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;he who is prudent&#8221; or &#8220;he who deals wisely&#8221; (cf. KJV). The proverb seems to be referring to wise business concerns and the reward for the righteous. One who deals wisely in a matter will find good results. R. N. Whybray sees a contrast here: &#8220;The shrewd man of business will succeed well, but the happy man is he who trusts the <sc>Lord&#8221; (<i>Proverbs </i>[CBC], 92). Synonymous parallelism is more appropriate.</p>
