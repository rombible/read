<A NAME="167"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1332><b>sn</b> The Hebrew term translated &#8220;right&#8221; (<font face="Hebrewtl">z~E</font>) means &#8220;innocent&#8221; (NIV) or &#8220;pure&#8221; (NAB, NRSV, NLT). It is used in the Bible for pure oils or undiluted liquids; here it means unmixed actions. Therefore on the one hand people rather naively conclude that their actions are fine.</p>
