<A NAME="1639"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1364><b>sn</b> The second line gives the effect of the first: If the king delivers such oracular sayings (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1462;&#1505;&#1462;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">qesem</font>, translated &#8220;divine verdict&#8221;), then he must be careful in the decisions he makes. The imperfect tense then requires a modal nuance to stress the obligation of the king not to act treacherously against justice. It would also be possible to translate the verb as a jussive: Let the king not act treacherously against justice. For duties of the king, e.g., Psalm 72 and Isaiah 11. For a comparison with Ezekiel 21:23-26, see E. W. Davies, &#8220;The Meaning of <i>qesem</i> in Prov 16:10,&#8221; <i>Bib</i> 61 (1980): 554-56.</p>
