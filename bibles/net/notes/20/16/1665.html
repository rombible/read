<A NAME="1665"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=1390><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;than to divide plunder.&#8221; The word &#8220;plunder&#8221; implies that the wealth taken by the proud was taken violently and wrongfully &#8211; spoils are usually taken in warfare. R. N. Whybray translates it with &#8220;loot&#8221; (<i>Proverbs </i>[CBC], 95). The proud are in rebellion against God, overbearing and oppressive. One should never share the &#8220;loot&#8221; with them. </p>
