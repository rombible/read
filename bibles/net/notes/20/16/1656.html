<A NAME="1656"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=1381><b>tn</b> The form is a Niphal participle, masculine singular. If it is modifying &#8220;understanding&#8221; it should be a feminine form. If it is to be translated, it would have to be rendered &#8220;and to acquire understanding is <i>to be chosen</i> more than silver&#8221; (cf. KJV, ASV, NASB).
