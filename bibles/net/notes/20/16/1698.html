<A NAME="1698"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">98</span><note=1423><b>tn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aluf</font>) refers to a &#8220;friend&#8221; or &#8220;an intimate associate.&#8221; The word has other possible translations, including &#8220;tame&#8221; or &#8220;docile&#8221; when used of animals. Rashi, a Jewish scholar who lived <sc>a.d. 1040-1105, took it in the later sense of &#8220;prince,&#8221; saying that such speech alienates the Prince, namely God. But that is a forced interpretation of the line.</p>
