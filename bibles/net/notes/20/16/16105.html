<A NAME="16105"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">105</span><note=1430><b>tn</b> The verb is a Piel perfect; it means &#8220;complete, finish, bring to an end.&#8221; The two cola may form the whole process: The first line has &#8220;to devise&#8221; evil, and the second has &#8220;he completes&#8221; evil. BDB, however, classifies this use of the Piel as &#8220;to accomplish in thought&#8221; meaning &#8220;to determine&#8221; something (BDB 478 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> 1f). In that case the two lines would have synonymous ideas, i.e., using facial expressions to plan evil actions.</p>
