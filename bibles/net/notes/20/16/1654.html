<A NAME="1654"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=1379><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;latter rain&#8221; (so KJV, ASV). The favor that this expression represents is now compared to the cloud of rain that comes with the &#8220;latter&#8221; rain or harvest rain. The point is that the rain cloud was necessary for the successful harvest; likewise the king&#8217;s pleasure will ensure the success and the productivity of the people under him. E.g., also Psalm 72:15-17; the prosperity of the land is portrayed as a blessing on account of the ideal king.</p>
