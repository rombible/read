<A NAME="1620"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1345><b>tc</b> The LXX has inserted two couplets here: &#8220;The beginning of a good way is to do justly, // and it is more acceptable with God than to do sacrifices; // he who seeks the <sc>Lord will find knowledge with righteousness, // and they who rightly seek him will find peace.&#8221; C. H. Toy reminds the reader that there were many proverbs in existence that sounded similar to those in the book of Proverbs; these lines are in the Greek OT as well as in Sirach (<i>Proverbs</i> [ICC], 321-22).</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> The B-line continues the A-line, but explains what it means that they are an abomination to the <sc>Lord &#8211; he will punish them. &#8220;Will not go unpunished&#8221; is an understatement (tapeinosis) to stress first that they will certainly be punished; those who humble themselves before God in faith will not be punished.</p>
