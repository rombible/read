<A NAME="1660"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=1385><b>tc</b> The LXX adds three lines after 17a and one after 17b: &#8220;The paths of life turn aside from evils, and the ways of righteousness are length of life; he who receives instruction will be prosperous, and he who regards reproofs will be made wise; he who guards his ways preserves his soul, and he who loves his life will spare his mouth.&#8221;</p>
