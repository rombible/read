<A NAME="1628"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1353><b>tn</b> The referent of the verb in the second colon is unclear. The straightforward answer is that it refers to the person whose ways please the <sc>Lord &#8211; it is his lifestyle that disarms his enemies. W. McKane comments that the righteous have the power to mend relationships (<i>Proverbs </i>[OTL], 491); see, e.g., 10:13; 14:9; 15:1; 25:21-22). The life that is pleasing to God will be above reproach and find favor with others. Some would interpret this to mean that God makes his enemies to be at peace with him (cf. KJV, NAB, NASB, NIV, NLT). This is workable, but in this passage it would seem God would do this through the pleasing life of the believer (cf. NCV, TEV, CEV).</p>
