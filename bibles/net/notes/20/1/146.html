But once the collection was included in the canon, the term &#8220;son&#8221; would be expanded to mean a disciple, for all the people were to learn wisdom when young. It would not be limited to sons alone but would include daughters &#8211; as the expression &#8220;the children of (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Scholar">bÿne</font>) Israel&#8221; (including males and females) clearly shows. Several passages in the Mishnah and Talmud record instructions to teach daughters the Mosaic law so that they will be righteous and avoid sin as well. The translation &#8220;my child,&#8221; although not entirely satisfactory, will be used here.</p>
