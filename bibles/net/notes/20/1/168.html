<a name="168"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">68</span><note=68><b>tn</b> The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ol</font>) can mean (1) &#8220;death,&#8221; cf. NCV; (2) &#8220;the grave,&#8221; cf. KJV, NIV, NLT (3) &#8220;Sheol&#8221; as the realm of departed spirits, cf. NAB &#8220;the nether world,&#8221; and (4) &#8220;extreme danger.&#8221; Here it is parallel to the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vor</font>, &#8220;the Pit&#8221;) so it is the grave or more likely &#8220;Sheol&#8221; (cf. ASV, NRSV). Elsewhere Sheol is personified as having an insatiable appetite and swallowing people alive as they descend to their death (e.g., Num 16:30, 33; Isa 5:14; Hab 2:5). In ancient Near Eastern literature, the grave is often personified in similar manner, e.g., in Ugaritic mythological texts Mot (= &#8220;death&#8221;) is referred to as &#8220;the great swallower.&#8221;</p>
