<a name="12"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2><b>tn</b> The name <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1502;&#1465;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shÿlomoh</font>, &#8220;of Solomon&#8221;) is a genitive of authorship or source. While Solomon wrote a majority of the proverbial sayings in the book, some proverbial sayings were written by others (e.g., 22:17-24:34; 30:1-33; 31:1-9) and perhaps collected by Solomon. The name also forms a phonetic wordplay on the similarly sounding word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mishley</font>, &#8220;proverbs&#8221;), as if to say the name is almost synonymous with proverbs.</p>
