<a name="1145"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">145</span><note=145><b>sn</b> The Hebrew verb &#8220;to kill&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1490;</font>, <font face="Scholar">harag</font>) is the end of the naive who refuse to change. The word is broad enough to include murder, massacre, killing in battle, and execution. Here it is judicial execution by God, using their own foolish choices as the means to ruin.</p>
