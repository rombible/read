<a name="110"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=10><b>tn</b> The infinitive construct + <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;</font> (<i>lamed</i>) here designates a second purpose of the book: to compare and to make proper evaluation of the sayings of the wise. The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bin</font>, &#8220;to discern&#8221;) refers to the ability to make distinctions between things. This is illustrated by its derivatives: The related preposition means &#8220;between&#8221; and the related noun means &#8220;space between.&#8221; So the verb refers to the ability to discern between moral options. </p>
