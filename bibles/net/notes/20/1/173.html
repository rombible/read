<a name="173"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">73</span><note=73><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Throw in your lot with us.&#8221; This is a figurative expression (hypocatastasis) urging the naive to join their life of crime and divide their loot equally. The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">goral</font>, &#8220;lot&#8221;) can refer to (1) lot thrown for decision-making processes, e.g., choosing the scapegoat (Lev 16:8), discovering a guilty party (Jonah 1:7) or allocating property (Josh 18:6); (2) allotted portion (Josh 15:1) and (3) allotted fate or future destiny (Prov 1:14; Dan 12:13; see BDB 174 s.v.). Here the criminals urged the lad to share their life. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tappil</font>) is an imperfect of injunction: &#8220;Throw in&#8230;!&#8221; but might also be an imperfect of permission: &#8220;you may throw.&#8221; It functions metonymically as an invitation to join their life of crime: &#8220;share with us&#8221; (BDB 658 s.v. 3). </p>
