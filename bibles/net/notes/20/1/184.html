<a name="184"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">84</span><note=84><b>tc</b> The <i>BHS</i> editors suggest deleting this entire verse from MT because it does not appear in several versions (Codex B of the LXX, Coptic, Arabic) and is similar to Isa 59:7a. It is possible that it was a scribal gloss (intentional addition) copied into the margin from Isaiah. But this does not adequately explain the differences. It does fit the context well enough to be original.</p>
