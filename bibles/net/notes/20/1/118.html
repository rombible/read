<a name="118"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=18><b>sn</b> The Hebrew noun translated &#8220;equity&#8221; comes from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yashar</font>) which has the basic idea of &#8220;upright, straight, right.&#8221; It refers to activity that is morally upright and straight, that is, on the proper moral path. Elsewhere it is used in a concrete sense to describe cows walking straight down a path without turning right or left (1 Sam 6:12). Wisdom literature often uses the motif of the straight path to describe a morally &#8220;straight&#8221; life.</p>
