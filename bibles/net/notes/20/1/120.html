<a name="120"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=20><b>tn</b> The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arÿmah</font>) &#8220;prudence, shrewdness, craftiness&#8221; (BDB 791 s.v.) or &#8220;cleverness&#8221; (<i>HALOT</i> 886 s.v. 1) refers to a shrewd plan of action, viewed positively or negatively. It is used negatively of planned deception (Josh 9:4) and premeditated murder (Exod 21:14). The related adjective described the serpent as &#8220;shrewd, crafty, cunning&#8221; (Gen 3:1); it describes cunning plans (Job 5:12) and deception (Job 15:5). The related verb describes a wicked concocted plan (Ps 83:4). The term is used positively of a morally prudent lifestyle (Prov 8:5, 12; 15:5; 19:25). There is no virtue for simpletons to be unaware in this world; they need to be wise as serpents. Proverbs provide a morally shrewd plan for life.</p>
