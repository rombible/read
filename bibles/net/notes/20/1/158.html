<a name="158"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=58><b>tn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1463;&#1496;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khatta</font>&#8217;) is the common word for &#8220;sinner&#8221; in the OT. Because the related verb is used once of sling-shot throwers who miss the mark (Judg 20:16), the idea of sin is often explained as &#8220;missing the moral mark&#8221; (BDB 306-8 s.v.). But the term should not be restricted to the idea of a sin of ignorance or simply falling short of the moral ideal. Its meaning is more likely seen in the related Akkadian term &#8220;to revolt, rebel.&#8221; It is active rebellion against authority. It is used here in reference to a gang of robbers.</p>
