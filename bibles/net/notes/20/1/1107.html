<a name="1107"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">107</span><note=107><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;delight.&#8221; The verb (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1491;</font>, <font face="Scholar">khamad</font>) is often translated &#8220;to take pleasure; to delight&#8221; but frequently has the meaning of a selfish desire, a coveting of something. It is the term, for example, used for coveting in the Decalogue (Exod 20:17; Deut 5:21) and for the covetous desire of Eve (Gen 3:6) and Achan (Josh 7:21). It is tempting to nuance it here as &#8220;illicit desire&#8221; for mockery.</p>
