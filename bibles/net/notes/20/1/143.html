<a name="143"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=43><b>tn</b> The verb of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1494;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bazah</font>, &#8220;despise&#8221;) means to treat things of value with contempt, as if they were worthless (BDB 102 s.v.). The classic example is Esau who despised his birthright and sold it for lentil stew (Gen 25:34). The perfect tense of this verb may be classified as characteristic perfect (what they have done and currently do) or gnomic perfect (what they always do in past, present and future). The latter is preferred; this describes a trait of fools, and elsewhere the book says that fools do not change.</p>
