There are two purpose statements in 1:2 (&#8220;to know wisdom&#8221; and &#8220;to discern sayings&#8221;). The first is stated in detail in 1:3-4, first from the perspective of the student then the teacher. 1:6 will state the second purpose of 1:2. But between the two the writer notes that even the wise can become wiser. The book is not just for neophytes; it is for all who want to grow in wisdom.</p>
