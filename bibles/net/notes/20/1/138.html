The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yara</font>&#8217;) is the common word for fear in the OT and has a basic three-fold range of meanings: (1) &#8220;dread; terror&#8221; (Deut 1:29; Jonah 1:10), (2) &#8220;to stand in awe&#8221; (1 Kgs 3:28), (3) &#8220;to revere; to respect&#8221; (Lev 19:3). With the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> as the object, it captures the polar opposites of shrinking back in fear and drawing close in awe and adoration. Both categories of meaning appear in Exod 20:20 (where the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> descended upon Sinai amidst geophysical convulsions); Moses encouraged the Israelites to not be afraid of God arbitrarily striking them dead for no reason (&#8220;Do not fear!&#8221;) but informed the people that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> revealed himself in such a terrifying manner to scare them from sinning (&#8220;God has come only to test you and to put the fear of him in you so that you do not sin&#8221;). The fear of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is expressed in reverential submission to his will &#8211; the characteristic of true worship. The fear of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is the foundation for wisdom (9:10) and the discipline leading to wisdom (15:33). It is expressed in hatred of evil (8:13) and avoidance of sin (16:6), and so results in prolonged life (10:27; 19:23). </p>
