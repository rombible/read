<A NAME="181"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1536><b>tn</b> The Niphal participle functions substantively and has a reflexive nuance: &#8220;one who has separated himself&#8221; (cf. KJV, ASV, NASB). He is not merely anti-social; he is a problem for society since he will defy sound judgment. The Mishnah uses the verse to teach the necessity of being part of a community because people have social responsibilities and need each other (<i>m. Avot</i> 2:4).</p>
<A NAME="182"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1537><b>tc</b> The MT has &#8220;seeks [his own] desire[s].&#8221; The translation in the LXX represents a Hebrew <i>Vorlage</i> of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1514;&#1465;&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿto</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">anah</font>) instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1514;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿta</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avah</font>); this could be translated &#8220;seeks his own occasion,&#8221; that is, &#8220;his own pretext&#8221; (C. H. Toy, <i>Proverbs </i>[ICC], 354; cf. NAB). The MT makes sense as it stands and the emendation is not really necessary. </p>
<A NAME="183"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1538><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;breaks out&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;showing contempt for&#8221;; NLT &#8220;snarling at.&#8221; This individual breaks out in contention against sound judgment. He is in opposition to society (e.g., Prov 17:14; 20:3).</p>
<A NAME="184"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1539><b>sn</b> This expression forms an understatement (<i>tapeinosis</i>);<i> </i>the opposite is the point &#8211; he detests understanding or discernment.</p>
<A NAME="185"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1540><b>tn</b> The Hitpael infinitive construct <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿhitgalot</font>) functions nominally as the object of the preposition. The term means &#8220;reveal, uncover, betray.&#8221; So the fool takes pleasure &#8220;in uncovering&#8221; his heart. </p>
<A NAME="186"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1541><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his heart.&#8221; This is a metonymy meaning &#8220;what is on his mind&#8221; (cf. NAB &#8220;displaying what he thinks&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;expressing personal opinion&#8221;). This kind of person is in love with his own ideas and enjoys spewing them out (W. McKane, <i>Proverbs </i>[OTL], 515). It is the kind of person who would ask a question, not to learn, but to show everyone how clever he is (cf. TEV). </p>
<A NAME="187"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1542><b>tc</b> The MT has &#8220;a wicked [person].&#8221; Many commentators emend the text to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">resha</font>&#8217;, &#8220;wickedness&#8221;) which makes better parallelism with &#8220;shame&#8221; (W. McKane, <i>Proverbs </i>[OTL], 521; R. B. Y. Scott, <i>Proverbs, Ecclesiastes </i>[AB], 112; C. H. Toy, <i>Proverbs</i> [ICC], 355; cf. NAB, NIV, NRSV). However, there is no external evidence for this emendation. </p>
<A NAME="188"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1543><b>sn</b> &#8220;Contempt&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;</font>, <font face="Scholar">buz</font>) accompanies the wicked; &#8220;reproach&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1462;&#1512;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">kherpah</font>) goes with shame. This reproach refers to the critical rebukes and taunts of the community against a wicked person.</p>
<A NAME="189"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1544><b>tn</b> The term &#8220;comes&#8221; does not appear in the Hebrew but is supplied in the translation for the sake of clarity and smoothness.</p>
<A NAME="1810"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1545><b>tn</b> The comparative &#8220;like&#8221; does not appear in the Hebrew text, but is implied by the metaphor; it is supplied in the translation for the sake of clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1811"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1546><b>sn</b> The metaphor &#8220;deep waters&#8221; indicates either that the words have an inexhaustible supply or that they are profound.</p>
<A NAME="1812"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1547><b>tn</b> There is debate about the nature of the parallelism between lines 4a and 4b. The major options are: (1) synonymous parallelism, (2) antithetical parallelism (e.g., NAB, NIV, NCV) or (3) formal parallelism. Normally a <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) would begin an antithetical clause; the structure and the ideas suggest that the second colon continues the idea of the first half, but in a parallel way rather than as additional predicates. The metaphors used in the proverb elsewhere describe the wise.</p>
<A NAME="1813"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1548><b>sn</b> This is an implied comparison (<i>hypocatastasis</i>), the fountain of wisdom being the person who speaks. The Greek version has &#8220;fountain of life&#8221; instead of &#8220;wisdom,&#8221; probably influenced from 10:11.</p>
<A NAME="1814"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1549><b>tn</b> The comparative &#8220;like&#8221; does not appear in the Hebrew text, but is implied by the metaphor; it is supplied for the sake of clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1815"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1550><b>sn</b> The point of this metaphor is that the wisdom is a continuous source of refreshing and beneficial ideas. </p>
<A NAME="1816"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1551><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;not good.&#8221; This is a figure known as tapeinosis, a deliberate understatement to emphasize a worst-case scenario: &#8220;it is terrible!&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1817"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1552><b>tn</b> The idiom &#8220;lifting up the face of&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1514; &#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Scholar">sÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et pÿne</font>) means &#8220;to show partiality&#8221; in decisions (e.g., Deut 10:17; Mal 2:9); cf. CEV, NLT &#8220;to favor.&#8221; The verbal form is the Qal infinitive construct from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nasa</font>&#8217;), which functions as the subject of the clause. </p>
<A NAME="1818"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1553><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the guilty,&#8221; since in the second colon &#8220;righteous&#8221; can also be understood in contrast as &#8220;innocent&#8221; (cf. NRSV, TEV, NLT).</p>
<A NAME="1819"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1554><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to turn aside&#8221; (so ASV); NASB &#8220;to thrust aside.&#8221; The second half of the verse may illustrate this reprehensible action. The Hiphil infinitive construct <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿhatot</font>) may serve either (1) as result, &#8220;showing partiality&#8230;<i>so that</i> the righteous are turned away,&#8221; or (2) as epexegetical infinitive, &#8220;showing partiality&#8230;<i>by </i>turning the righteous away.&#8221; The second is preferred in the translation. Depriving the innocent of their rights is a perversion of justice.</p>
<A NAME="1820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1555><b>sn</b> The &#8220;lips&#8221; is a metonymy of cause, meaning what the fool says. The &#8220;mouth&#8221; in the second colon is likewise a metonymy for speech, what comes out of the mouth.</p>
<A NAME="1821"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1556><b>sn</b> &#8220;Strife&#8221; is a metonymy of cause, it is the cause of the beating or flogging that follows; &#8220;flogging&#8221; in the second colon is a metonymy of effect, the flogging is the effect of the strife. The two together give the whole picture. </p>
<A NAME="1822"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1557><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;calls for.&#8221; This is personification: What the fool says &#8220;calls for&#8221; a beating or flogging. The fool deserves punishment, but does not actually request it.</p>
<A NAME="1823"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1558><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;blows.&#8221; This would probably be physical beatings, either administered by the father or by society (e.g., also 19:25; Ps 141:5; cf. NAB, NIV, TEV, NLT). Today, however, &#8220;a beating&#8221; could be associated with violent criminal assault, whereas the context suggests punishment. Therefore &#8220;a flogging&#8221; is used in the translation, since that term is normally associated with disciplinary action.</p>
<A NAME="1824"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1559><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his soul&#8221; (so KJV, NASB, NIV).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> What a fool says can ruin him. Calamity and misfortune can come to a person who makes known his lack of wisdom by what he says. It may be that his words incite anger, or merely reveal stupidity; in either case, he is in trouble.</p>
<A NAME="1825"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1560><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;slanderer&#8221;; KJV, NAB &#8220;talebearer&#8221;; ASV, NRSV &#8220;whisperer.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1826"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1561><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1500;&#1463;&#1492;&#1458;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kÿmitlahamim</font>) occurs only here. It is related to a cognate verb meaning &#8220;to swallow greedily.&#8221; Earlier English versions took it from a Hebrew root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">halam</font>, see the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1492;&#1458;&#1500;&#1467;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> [<font face="Scholar">lÿmahalumot</font>] in v. 6) meaning &#8220;wounds&#8221; (so KJV). But the translation of &#8220;choice morsels&#8221; fits the idea of gossip better.</p>
<A NAME="1827"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1562><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they go down [into] the innermost parts of the belly&#8221;; NASB &#8220;of the body.&#8221; </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> When the <i>choice morsels</i> of gossip are received, they go down like delicious food &#8211; into the innermost being. R. N. Whybray says, &#8220;There is a flaw in human nature that assures slander will be listened to&#8221; (<i>Proverbs </i>[CBC], 105). </p>
<A NAME="1828"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1563><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Also, the one who.&#8221; Many commentators and a number of English versions omit the word &#8220;also.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1829"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1564><b>tn</b> The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mitrappeh</font>) is the Hitpael participle, &#8220;showing oneself slack.&#8221; The verb means &#8220;to sink; to relax,&#8221; and in the causative stem &#8220;to let drop&#8221; the hands. This is the lazy person who does not even try to work.</p>
<A NAME="1830"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1565><b>sn</b> These two troubling types, the slacker and the destroyer, are closely related.</p>
<A NAME="1831"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1566><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;possessor of destruction.&#8221; This idiom means &#8220;destroyer&#8221; (so ASV); KJV &#8220;a great waster&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;a vandal.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="1832"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1567><b>sn</b> The &#8220;name of the <sc>Lord&#8221; is a metonymy of subject. The &#8220;name&#8221; here signifies not the personal name &#8220;Yahweh,&#8221; for that would be redundant in the expression &#8220;the name of Yahweh,&#8221; but the attributes of the <sc>Lord (cf. Exod 34:5-7) &#8211; here his power to protect.</p>
<A NAME="1833"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1568><b>tn</b> The comparative &#8220;like&#8221; does not appear in the Hebrew text, but is implied by the metaphor; it is supplied for the sake of clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1834"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1569><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a tower of strength,&#8221; with &#8220;strength&#8221; regarded as attributive by most English versions. The metaphor &#8220;strong tower&#8221; indicates that God<sc> is a secure refuge. The figure is qualified in the second colon.</p>
<A NAME="1835"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1570><b>sn</b> The metaphor of &#8220;running&#8221; to the <sc>Lord refers to a whole-hearted and unwavering trust in God&#8217;s protection (e.g., Isa 40:31). </p>
<A NAME="1836"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1571><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;is high&#8221; or &#8220;is inaccessible.&#8221; This military-type expression stresses the effect of the trust &#8211; security, being out of danger (see <i>HALOT </i>1305 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1490;&#1489;</font>). Other scriptures will supply the ways that God actually protects people who trust him.</p>
<A NAME="1837"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1572><b>sn</b> This proverb forms a contrast with the previous one. The rich, unlike the righteous, trust in wealth and not in God.</p>
<A NAME="1838"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1573><b>tn</b> The comparative &#8220;like&#8221; does not appear in the Hebrew text, but is implied by the metaphor; it is supplied for the sake of clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1839"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1574><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;city of his strength&#8221;; NIV &#8220;fortified city.&#8221; This term refers to their place of refuge, what they look to for security and protection in time of trouble.</p>
<A NAME="1840"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1575><b>tc</b> The MT reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿmaskito</font>, &#8220;in his imaginations&#8221;). The LXX, <i>Tg</i>. Prov 18:11, and the Latin reflect <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1513;&#1474;&#1467;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bimsukato</font>, &#8220;like a fence [or, high wall]&#8221;) that is, wealth provides protection. The MT reading, on the other hand, suggests that this security is only in the mind.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> The proverb is an observation saying, reporting a common assumption without commenting on it. The juxtaposition with the last verse is a loud criticism of this misguided faith. The final word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (&#8220;in his imaginations&#8221;) indicates that one&#8217;s wealth is a futile place of refuge. </p>
<A NAME="1841"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1576><b>sn</b> The term &#8220;heart&#8221; is a metonymy of subject, referring to the seat of the spiritual and intellectual capacities &#8211; the mind, the will, the motivations and intentions. Proud ambitions and intentions will lead to a fall.</p>
<A NAME="1842"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1577><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[is] before honor&#8221;; cf. CEV &#8220;humility leads to honor.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1843"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1578><b>sn</b> The way to honor is through humility (e.g., Prov 11:2; 15:33; 16:18). The humility and exaltation of Jesus provides the classic example (Phil 2:1-10).</p>
<A NAME="1844"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1579><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;returns a word&#8221;; KJV &#8220;He that answereth a matter.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1845"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1580><b>sn</b> Poor listening and premature answering indicate that the person has a low regard for what the other is saying, or that he is too absorbed in his own ideas. The Mishnah lists this as the second characteristic of the uncultured person (<i>m. Avot</i> 5:7). </p>
<A NAME="1846"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1581><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;it is folly to him and shame.&#8221; The verse uses formal parallelism, with the second colon simply completing the thought of the first.</p>
<A NAME="1847"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1582><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the spirit of a man.&#8221; Because the verb of this clause is a masculine form, some have translated this line as &#8220;with spirit a man sustains,&#8221; but that is an unnecessary change. </p>
<A NAME="1848"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1583><b>sn</b> This is a rhetorical question, asserting that very few can cope with depression.</p>
<A NAME="1849"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=1584><b>sn</b> The figure of a &#8220;crushed spirit&#8221; (ASV, NAB, NCV, NRSV &#8220;a broken spirit,&#8221; comparing depression to something smashed or crushed) suggests a broken will, a loss of vitality, despair, and emotional pain. In physical sickness one can fall back on the will to live; but in depression even the will to live is gone. </p>
<A NAME="1850"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=1585><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;discerning heart.&#8221; The term &#8220;heart&#8221; is a synecdoche of part (= heart) for the whole (= person); cf. TEV, NLT &#8220;intelligent people.&#8221; By paralleling &#8220;heart&#8221; and &#8220;ear&#8221; the proverb stresses the full acquisition of knowledge. The &#8220;ear&#8221; listens to instruction, and the heart considers what is heard to acquire knowledge.</p>
<A NAME="1851"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=1586><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the ear of the wise.&#8221; The term &#8220;ear&#8221; is a synecdoche of part (= ear) for the whole (= person): &#8220;wise person.&#8221; </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The wise continually seek more knowledge. D. Kidner says, &#8220;Those who know most know best how little they know&#8221; (<i>Proverbs </i>[TOTC], 129).</p>
<A NAME="1852"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=1587><b>sn</b> This line features a mixed metaphor: The &#8220;ear&#8221; is pictured &#8220;seeking.&#8221; The &#8220;ear of the wise&#8221; actually means the wise person&#8217;s capacity to hear, and so the wise are seeking as they hear.</p>
<A NAME="1853"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=1588><b>sn</b> The Hebrew term translated &#8220;gift&#8221; is a more general term than &#8220;bribe&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1495;&#1463;&#1491;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shokhad</font>), used in 17:8, 23. But it also has danger (e.g., 15:27; 21:14), for by giving gifts one might learn how influential they are and use them for bribes. The proverb simply states that a gift can expedite matters.</p>
<A NAME="1854"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=1589><b>sn</b> The two verbs here show a progression, helping to form the synthetic parallelism. The gift first &#8220;makes room&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yarkhiv</font>) for the person, that is, extending a place for him, and then &#8220;ushers him in&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1504;&#1456;&#1495;&#1461;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yakhenu</font>) among the greats.</p>

The latter is reflected in most of the ancient versions. There is not an appreciable difference in the translations, except for the use of the conjunction.</p>
<A NAME="1859"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=1594><b>sn</b> The proverb is a continuous sentence teaching that there must be cross-examination to settle legal disputes. There are two sides in any disputes, and so even though the first to present his case sounds right, it must be challenged. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">haqar</font>, translated &#8220;cross-examines&#8221;) is used for careful, diligent searching and investigating to know something (e.g., Ps 139:1).</p>
<A NAME="1860"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=1595><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;casting the lot.&#8221; Because modern readers are not familiar with the ancient practice of casting lots, the image of the coin toss to decide an issue has been employed in the translation (cf. CEV &#8220;drawing straws&#8221;). Although the casting of lots is often compared to throwing dice, the translation &#8220;throwing dice ends disputes&#8221; in this context could be misunderstood to mean &#8220;participating in a game of dice ends disputes.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1861"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=1596><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yashbit</font>) is the Hiphil imperfect from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shavat</font>), meaning &#8220;to cause to cease; to bring to an end; to end&#8221;; cf. NIV &#8220;settles disputes.&#8221; The assumption behind this practice and this saying is that providence played the determining role in the casting of lots. If both parties accepted this, then the issue could be resolved.</p>
<A NAME="1862"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=1597><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;makes a separation&#8221; or &#8220;decides.&#8221; In the book of Proverbs this verb often has a negative connotation, such as separating close friends (e.g., 16:9). But here it has a positive nuance: Opponents are &#8220;separated&#8221; by settling the issue.</p>
<A NAME="1863"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=1598><b>tn</b> The word is the adjective, &#8220;mighty&#8221; (so KJV, NAB, NASB) used here substantivally as the object of the preposition.</p>

<A NAME="1866"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=1601><b>tc</b> The LXX has a clear antithetical proverb here: &#8220;A brother helped is like a stronghold, but disputes are like bars of a citadel.&#8221; Accordingly, the editors of <i>BHS</i> propose <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1506;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">moshia</font>&#8217;) instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nifsha</font>&#8217;, so also the other versions and the RSV). But since both lines use the comparison with a citadel (fortified/barred), the antithesis is problematic. </p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;is harder to reach&#8221; is supplied in the translation on the basis of the comparative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">min</font>). It is difficult to get into a fortified city; it is more difficult to reach an offended brother. </p>
<A NAME="1867"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=1602><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;bars,&#8221; but this could be understood to mean &#8220;taverns,&#8221; so &#8220;barred gates&#8221; is employed in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="1868"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">68</span><note=1603><b>sn</b> The proverb is talking about changing a friend or a relative into an enemy by abuse or strife &#8211; the bars go up, as it were. And the &#8220;walls&#8221; that are erected are not easily torn down.</p>
<A NAME="1869"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">69</span><note=1604><b>sn</b> Two images are used in this proverb: the fruit of the mouth and the harvest of the lips. They are synonymous; the first is applied to the orchard and the second to the field. The &#8220;mouth&#8221; and the &#8220;lips&#8221; are metonymies of cause, and so both lines are speaking about speech that is productive.</p>
<A NAME="1870"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">70</span><note=1605><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his midst.&#8221; This is rendered &#8220;his stomach&#8221; because of the use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sava</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to be satisfied; to be sated; to be filled&#8221;), which is usually used with food (cf. KJV, ASV &#8220;belly&#8221;). </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Productive speech is not just satisfying &#8211; it meets the basic needs of life. There is a practical return for beneficial words.</p>

<A NAME="1872"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">72</span><note=1607><b>sn</b> What people say can lead to life or death. The <i>Midrash on Psalms</i> shows one way the tongue [what is said] can cause death: &#8220;The evil tongue slays three, the slanderer, the slandered, and the listener&#8221; (<i>Midrash Tehillim</i> 52:2). See J. G. Williams, &#8220;The Power of Form: A Study of Biblical Proverbs,&#8221; <i>Semeia</i> 17 (1980): 35-38.</p>
<A NAME="1873"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">73</span><note=1608><b>tn</b> The referent of &#8220;it&#8221; must be the tongue, i.e., what the tongue says (= &#8220;its use&#8221;). So those who enjoy talking, indulging in it, must &#8220;eat&#8221; its fruit, whether good or bad. The expression &#8220;eating the fruit&#8221; is an implied comparison; it means accept the consequences of loving to talk (cf. TEV). </p>
<A NAME="1874"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">74</span><note=1609><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">matsa</font>&#8217;, translated &#8220;finds&#8221;) is used twice in the first colon. It is paralleled by the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">puq</font>, translated &#8220;receives&#8221;) in the second colon, which carries the same nuance as the preceding verbs. The first perfect tense verb might function in a hypothetical or conditional sense: &#8220;If a man finds&#8230;then he finds.&#8221; But taken as a principle the nuances of the verbs would be gnomic or characteristic.</p>
<A NAME="1875"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">75</span><note=1610><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;good.&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tov</font>, &#8220;good; enjoyable; fortune&#8221;) might be an allusion to Gen 2:18, which affirms that it is not good for man to be alone. The word describes that which is pleasing to God, beneficial for life, and abundantly enjoyable.</p>
<A NAME="1876"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">76</span><note=1611><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;what is pleasant.&#8221; The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1510;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ratson</font>, &#8220;what is pleasing&#8221;) is often interpreted in a religious-theological sense here: &#8220;receives favor from the <sc>Lord&#8221; (cf. KJV, NASB, NIV, NRSV). However, this term is probably referring to the pleasure that a person enjoys in marriage, so it should be understood in a nonreligious, marital sense: &#8220;pleasure&#8221; (e.g., Esth 1:8; <i>HALOT</i> 1282 s.v. 1); cf. CEV &#8220;she is a gift from the Lord.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The parallelism is formal; the second line of the verse continues the first but explains it further: Finding a spouse, one receives a pleasurable gift from God.</p>
<A NAME="1877"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">77</span><note=1612><b>tc</b> The LXX adds this embellishment to complete the thought: &#8220;Whoever puts away a good wife puts away good, and whoever keeps an adulteress is foolish and ungodly.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1878"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">78</span><note=1613><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;speaks supplications&#8221;; NIV &#8220;pleads for mercy.&#8221; The poor man has to ask for help because he has no choice (cf. CEV). The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1463;&#1468;&#1495;&#1458;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">takhanun</font>) is a &#8220;supplication for favor&#8221; (related to the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1504;&#1463;&#1503;</font> [<font face="Scholar">khanan</font>], &#8220;to be gracious; to show favor&#8221;). So the poor man speaks, but what he speaks is a request for favor.</p>
<A NAME="1879"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">79</span><note=1614><b>sn</b> The rich person responds harshly to the request. He has hardened himself against such appeals because of relentless demands. The proverb is an observation saying; it simply describes the way the world generally works, rather than setting this out as the ideal.</p>
<A NAME="1880"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">80</span><note=1615><b>tc</b> The construction is &#8220;a man of friends&#8221; (cf. NASB) meaning a man who has friends (a genitive of the thing possessed). C. H. Toy, however, suggests reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1461;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yesh</font>) instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ish</font>), along with some of the Greek <sc>mss, the Syriac, and <i>Tg</i>. Prov 18:24. It would then say &#8220;there are friends&#8221; who are unreliable (<i>Proverbs</i> [ICC], 366); cf. NLT. However, the MT should be retained here.</p>
<A NAME="1881"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">81</span><note=1616><b>tn</b> The text simply has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1512;&#1465;&#1506;&#1461;&#1506;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿhitro</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ea</font>&#8217;), which means &#8220;for being crushed&#8221; or &#8220;to be shattered&#8221; (but not &#8220;to show oneself friendly&#8221; as in the KJV). What can be made of the sentence is that &#8220;a man who has [many] friends [may have them] for being crushed&#8221; &#8211; the infinitive giving the result (i.e., &#8220;with the result that he may be crushed by them&#8221;). </p>
