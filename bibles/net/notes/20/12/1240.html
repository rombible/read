<A NAME="1240"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=995><b>tc</b> The <i>Kethib</i> has the Qal<i> </i>imperfect, &#8220;will return&#8221; to him (cf. NASB); the <i>Qere</i> preserves a Hiphil imperfect, &#8220;he/one will restore/render&#8221; to him (cf. KJV, ASV). The <i>Qere</i> seems to suggest that someone (God or people) will reward him in kind. Since there is no expressed subject, it may be translated as a passive voice. </p>
