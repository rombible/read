<A NAME="1273"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">73</span><note=1028><b>tn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kharats</font>, &#8220;diligent&#8221;) means (1) literally: &#8220;to cut; to sharpen,&#8221; (2) figurative: &#8220;to decide&#8221; and &#8220;to be diligent. It is used figuratively in Proverbs for diligence. The semantic development of the figure may be understood thus: &#8220;cut, sharpen&#8221; leads to &#8220;act decisively&#8221; which leads to &#8220;be diligent.&#8221; By their diligent work they succeed to management. The diligent rise to the top, while the lazy sink to the bottom.</p>
