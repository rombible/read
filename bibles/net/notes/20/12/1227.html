<A NAME="1227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=982><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;but the mercies.&#8221; The additional words appear in the translation for the sake of clarification. The line can be interpreted in two ways: (1) when the wicked exhibit a kind act, they do it in a cruel way, or (2) even the kindest of their acts is cruel by all assessments, e.g., stuffing animals with food to fatten them for market &#8211; their &#8220;kindness&#8221; is driven by ulterior motives (J. H. Greenstone, <i>Proverbs</i>, 129).</p>
