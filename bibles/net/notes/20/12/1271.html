<A NAME="1271"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=1026><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the heart of fools.&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1461;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lev</font>, &#8220;heart&#8221;) functions as a synecdoche of part (= heart) for the whole (= person): &#8220;foolish people.&#8221; This type of fool despises correction and instruction. His intent is to proclaim all that he does &#8211; which is folly. W. McKane says that the more one speaks, the less likely he is able to speak effectively (<i>Proverbs </i>[OTL], 422). Cf. TEV &#8220;stupid people advertise their ignorance&#8221;; NLT &#8220;fools broadcast their folly.&#8221;</p>
