<A NAME="1263"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=1018><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;all calamity.&#8221; The proper nuance of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1493;&#1462;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aven</font>) is debated. It is normally understood metonymically (effect) as &#8220;harm; trouble,&#8221; that is, the result/effect of wickedness (e.g., Gen 50:20). Rashi, a Jewish scholar who lived <sc>a.d. 1040-1105, took it as &#8220;wickedness,&#8221; its primary meaning; &#8220;the righteous will not be caught up in wickedness.&#8221;</p>
