<A NAME="193"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1619><b>tc</b> The Syriac and <i>Tg</i>. Prov 19:1 read &#8220;rich&#8221; instead of MT &#8220;fool.&#8221; This makes tighter antithetical parallelism than MT and is followed by NAB. However, the MT makes sense as it stands; this is an example of metonymical parallelism. The MT reading is also supported by the LXX. The Hebrew construction uses <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿhu</font>&#8217;), &#8220;and he [is],&#8221; before &#8220;fool.&#8221; This may be rendered &#8220;one who is perverse while a fool&#8221; or &#8220;a fool at the same time.&#8221; </p>
