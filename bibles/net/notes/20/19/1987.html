<A NAME="1987"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">87</span><note=1703><b>tn</b> The more generic &#8220;child&#8221; does not fit the activities described in this verse and so &#8220;son&#8221; is retained in the translation. In the ancient world a &#8220;son&#8221; was more likely than a daughter to behave as stated. Such behavior may reflect the son wanting to take over his father&#8217;s lands prematurely.</p>
