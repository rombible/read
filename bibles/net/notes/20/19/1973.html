<A NAME="1973"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">73</span><note=1689><b>sn</b> The second half of the proverb presents the logical inference: The liar would be without &#8220;loyal love&#8221; entirely, and so poverty would be better than this. A poor person who wishes to do better is preferable to a person who makes promises and does not keep them.</p>
