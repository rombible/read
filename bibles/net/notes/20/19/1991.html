<A NAME="1991"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">91</span><note=1707><b>tn</b> The parallel line says the mouth of the wicked &#8220;gulps down&#8221; or &#8220;swallows&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yÿvala</font>&#8217;) iniquity. The verb does not seem to fit the line (or the proverb) very well. Some have emended the text to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1506;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yavia</font>&#8217;, &#8220;gushes&#8221;) as in 15:28 (cf. NAB &#8220;pours out&#8221;). Driver followed an Arabic <i>balaga</i> to get &#8220;enunciates,&#8221; which works well with the idea of a false witness (W. McKane, <i>Proverbs </i>[OTL], 529). As it stands, however, the line indicates that in what he says the wicked person accepts evil &#8211; and that could describe a false witness. </p>
