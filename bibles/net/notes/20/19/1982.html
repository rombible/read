<A NAME="1982"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">82</span><note=1698><b>sn</b> Different people learn differently. There are three types of people in this proverb: the <i>scorner</i> with a closed mind, the <i>simpleton</i> with an empty mind, and the <i>discerning person</i> with an open mind (D. Kidner, <i>Proverbs </i>[TOTC], 135). The simpleton learns by observing a scoffer being punished, even though the punishment will have no effect on the scoffer.</p>
