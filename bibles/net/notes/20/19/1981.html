<A NAME="1981"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">81</span><note=1697><b>tn</b> The Hiphil imperfect <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">takeh</font>) is followed by another imperfect. It could be rendered: &#8220;strike a scorner [imperfect of instruction] and a simpleton will become prudent.&#8221; But the first of the parallel verbs can also be subordinated to the second as a temporal or conditional clause. Some English versions translate &#8220;beat&#8221; (NAB &#8220;if you beat an arrogant man&#8221;), but this could be understood to refer to competition rather than physical punishment. Therefore &#8220;flog&#8221; has been used in the translation, since it is normally associated with punishment or discipline.</p>
