<A NAME="1962"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=1678><b>tn</b> The second colon of the verse is very difficult, and there have been many proposals as to its meaning: (1) &#8220;If you save [your enemy], you will add [good to yourself]&#8221;; (2) &#8220;If you save [your son by chastening], you may continue [chastisement and so educate him]&#8221;; (3) &#8220;If you deliver [him by paying the fine for him once], you will have to do it again&#8221;; (4) &#8220;If you save [him this time], you will have to increase [the punishment later on].&#8221; All interpretations have to supply a considerable amount of material (indicated by brackets). Many English versions are similar to (3).</p>
