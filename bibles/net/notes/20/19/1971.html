<A NAME="1971"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=1687><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the desire of a man&#8221; (so KJV). The noun in construct is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ta</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avat</font>), &#8220;desire [of].&#8221; Here it refers to &#8220;the desire of a man [= person].&#8221; Two problems surface here, the connotation of the word and the kind of genitive. &#8220;Desire&#8221; can also be translated &#8220;lust,&#8221; and so J. H. Greenstone has &#8220;The lust of a man is his shame&#8221; (<i>Proverbs</i>, 208). But the sentence is more likely positive in view of the more common uses of the words. &#8220;Man&#8221; could be a genitive of possession or subjective genitive &#8211; the man desires loyal love. It could also be an objective genitive, meaning &#8220;what is desired for a man.&#8221; The first would be the more natural in the proverb, which is showing that loyal love is better than wealth.</p>
