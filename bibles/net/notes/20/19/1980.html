<A NAME="1980"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">80</span><note=1696><b>sn</b> This humorous portrayal is an exaggeration; but the point is that laziness can overcome hunger. It would have a wider application for anyone who would start a project and then lack the interest or energy to finish it (R. N. Whybray, <i>Proverbs </i>[CBC], 111). Ibn Ezra proposes that the dish was empty, because the sluggard was too lazy to provide for himself. </p>
