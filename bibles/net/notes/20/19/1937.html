<A NAME="1937"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1653><b>sn</b> The verse contrasts the &#8220;rage&#8221; of the king with his &#8220;favor&#8221; by using two similes. The first simile presents the king at his most dangerous &#8211; his anger (e.g., 20:2; Amos 3:4). The second simile presents his favor as beneficial for life (e.g., 16:14-15; 28:15).</p>
