<A NAME="1957"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=1673><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;and his good deed will repay him.&#8221; The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1467;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gÿmulo</font>) could be (1) the subject or (2) part of a double accusative of the verb. Understanding it as part of the double accusative makes better sense, for then the subject of the verb is God. How &#8220;his deed&#8221; could repay him is not immediately obvious.</p>
