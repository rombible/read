<A NAME="1989"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">89</span><note=1705><b>tn</b> The second line has an infinitive construct <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1490;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lishgot</font>), meaning &#8220;to stray; to go astray; to err.&#8221; It indicates the result of the instruction &#8211; stop listening, and as a result you will go astray. The LXX took it differently: &#8220;A son who ceases to attend to discipline is likely to stray from words of knowledge.&#8221; RSV sees the final clause as the purpose of the instructions to be avoided: &#8220;do not listen to instructions to err.&#8221;</p>
