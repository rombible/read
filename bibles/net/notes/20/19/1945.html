<A NAME="1945"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1661><b>sn</b> This statement describes a wife who has a skillful use of knowledge and discretion that proves to be successful. This contrasts with the preceding verse. The proverb is not concerned about unhappy marriages or bad wives (both of which exist); it simply affirms that when a marriage works out well one should credit it as a gift from God.</p>
