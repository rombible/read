<A NAME="1942"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1658><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;is a constant dripping.&#8221; The term &#8220;like&#8221; does not appear in the Hebrew but is supplied in the translation for the sake of clarity. The metaphor pictures water dropping (perhaps rain through the roof, cf. NRSV, CEV) in a continuous flow: It is annoying and irritating (e.g., Prov 27:15-16).</p>
