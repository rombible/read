<A NAME="195"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1621><b>tn</b> The interpretation of this line depends largely on the meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nefesh</font>) which has a broad range of meanings: (1) the breathing substance of man, (2) living being, (3) life, (4) person, (5) seat of the appetites, (6) seat of emotions and passions, (7) activities of intellect, emotion and will, (8) moral character, etc. (BDB 659-61 s.v.). In light of the synonymous parallelism, the most likely nuance here is &#8220;zeal, passion&#8221; (<i>HALOT </i>713 s.v. 8). NIV takes the word in the sense of &#8220;vitality&#8221; and &#8220;drive&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;it is not good to have zeal without knowledge&#8221; (cf. NCV, TEV, and NLT which are all similar). </p>
