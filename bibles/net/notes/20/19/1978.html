<A NAME="1978"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">78</span><note=1694><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he will not be visited&#8221; (so KJV, ASV). The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">paqad</font>) is often translated &#8220;visit.&#8221; It describes intervention that will change the destiny. If God &#8220;visits&#8221; it means he intervenes to bless or to curse. To be &#8220;visited by trouble&#8221; means that calamity will interfere with the course of life and change the direction or the destiny. Therefore this is not referring to a minor trouble that one might briefly experience. A life in the <sc>Lord cannot be disrupted by such major catastrophes that would alter one&#8217;s destiny.</p>
