<A NAME="1968"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">68</span><note=1684><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the heart of a man&#8221; (cf. NAB, NIV). Here &#8220;heart&#8221; is used for the seat of thoughts, plans, and reasoning, so the translation uses &#8220;mind.&#8221; In contemporary English &#8220;heart&#8221; is more often associated with the seat of emotion than with the seat of planning and reasoning.</p>
