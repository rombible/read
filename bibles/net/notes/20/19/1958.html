<A NAME="1958"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=1674><b>tn</b> The translation understands <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) as causal. Some prefer to take <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> as temporal and translate, &#8220;while there is hope&#8221; (so KJV, NASB, NCV, NRSV, NLT), meaning that discipline should be administered when the child is young and easily guided. In the causal reading of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font>, the idea seems to be that children should be disciplined because change is possible due to their youth and the fact that they are not set in their ways.</p>
