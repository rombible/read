<A NAME="192"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1618><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;lips.&#8221; The term &#8220;lips&#8221; is a metonymy for what one says with his lips. The expression &#8220;perverse in his lips&#8221; refers to speech that is morally perverted. Some medieval Hebrew <sc>mss, the Syriac, and <i>Tg</i>. Prov 19:1 have &#8220;his ways&#8221; rather than &#8220;his lips&#8221; (e.g., Prov 28:6); cf. NAB. </p>
