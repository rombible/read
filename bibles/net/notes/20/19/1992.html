<A NAME="1992"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">92</span><note=1708><b>tc</b> Some (cf. NAB) suggest emending the MT&#8217;s &#8220;judgments&#8221; (from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1496;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shafat</font>) to &#8220;rods&#8221; (from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1496;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shavat</font>); however, this is not necessary if the term in the MT is interpreted figuratively. The LXX &#8220;scourges&#8221; might reflect a different <i>Vorlage</i>, but it also could have been an interpretive translation from the same text. &#8220;Judgments&#8221; is a metonymy of cause and refers to the punishment that the scoffer is to receive.</p>
