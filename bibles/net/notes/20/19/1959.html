<A NAME="1959"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=1675><b>tn</b> The expression &#8220;do not lift up your soul/life&#8221; to his death may mean (1) &#8220;do not set your heart&#8221; on his death (cf. ASV, NAB, NASB, NRSV), or it may mean (2) &#8220;do not be a willing partner&#8221; (cf. NIV). The parent is to discipline a child, but he is not to take it to the extreme and destroy or kill the child. </p>
