<A NAME="2437"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=2071><b>tn</b> The form rendered &#8220;rebellious&#8221; is difficult; it appears to be the Qal active participle, plural, from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shanah</font>), &#8220;to change&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;those who change.&#8221; The RV might have thought of the idea of &#8220;change&#8221; when they rendered it &#8220;political agitators.&#8221; The Syriac and <i>Tg</i>. Prov 24:21 have &#8220;fools,&#8221; the Latin has &#8220;detractors,&#8221; and the LXX reads, &#8220;do not disobey either of them,&#8221; referring to God and the king in the first line. Accordingly the ruin predicted in the next line would be the ruin that God and the king can inflict. If the idea of &#8220;changers&#8221; is retained, it would have to mean people who at one time feared God and the king but no longer do.</p>
