<A NAME="2412"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2046><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;possessor of schemes&#8221;; NAB &#8220;an intriguer.&#8221; The picture of the wicked person is graphic: He devises plans to do evil and is known as a schemer. Elsewhere the &#8220;schemes&#8221; are outrageous and lewd (e.g., Lev 18:7; Judg 20:6). Here the description portrays him as a cold, calculating, active person: &#8220;the fool is capable of intense mental activity but it adds up to sin&#8221; (W. McKane, <i>Proverbs </i>[OTL], 399).</p>
