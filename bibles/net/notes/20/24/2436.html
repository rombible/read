<A NAME="2436"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=2070><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;do not get mixed up with&#8221;; cf. TEV &#8220;Have nothing to do with&#8221;; NIV &#8220;do not join with.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arav</font>) is used elsewhere meaning &#8220;to exchange; to take on pledge.&#8221; In the Hitpael stem it means &#8220;to have fellowship; to share; to associate with.&#8221; Some English versions (e.g., KJV) interpret as &#8220;to meddle&#8221; in this context, because &#8220;to have fellowship&#8221; is certainly not what is meant.</p>
