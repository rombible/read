<A NAME="2426"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2060><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;wicked&#8221; could be taken as a vocative (cf. KJV, ASV, NASB, &#8220;O wicked <i>man</i>&#8221;); but since the next line refers to the wicked this is unlikely. It serves better as an adverbial accusative (&#8220;like the wicked&#8221;).</p>
