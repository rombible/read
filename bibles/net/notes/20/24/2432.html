<A NAME="2432"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2066><b>sn</b> The judgment of God should strike a note of fear in the heart of people (e.g., Lev 19:17-18). His judgment is not to be taken lightly, or personalized as a victory. If that were to happen, then the <sc>Lord might take pity on the enemies in their calamity, for he champions the downtrodden and defeated. These are probably personal enemies; the imprecatory psalms and the prophetic oracles present a different set of circumstances for the downfall of God&#8217;s enemies &#8211; even the book of Proverbs says that brings joy to the community.</p>
