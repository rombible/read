<A NAME="2446"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=2080><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yakhakh</font>) means &#8220;to decide; to adjudge; to prove.&#8221; This word occurs frequently in the book of Proverbs meaning &#8220;to reprove&#8221; or &#8220;to rebuke.&#8221; It deals with disputes, legal or otherwise. It can refer to a charge against someone or starting a dispute (and so rebuke); it can mean quarrel, argue; and it can mean settle a dispute. In this context the first or last use would work: (1) reproving the wicked for what they do (cf. KJV, NASB, NRSV), or (2) convicting them in a legal setting (cf. NAB, NIV, NLT). In light of the previous forensic context the second sense is preferred here.</p>
