<A NAME="2428"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=2062><b>tn</b> The clause beginning with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) could be interpreted as causal or conditional; but in view of the significance of the next clause it seems better to take it as a concessive clause (&#8220;although&#8221;). Its verb then receives a modal nuance of possibility. The apodosis is then &#8220;and he rises up,&#8221; which could be a participle or a perfect tense; although he may fall, he gets up (or, will get up).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The righteous may suffer adversity or misfortune any number of times &#8211; seven times here &#8211; but they will &#8220;rise&#8221; for virtue triumphs over evil in the end (R. N. Whybray, <i>Proverbs </i>[CBC], 140).</p>
