<A NAME="2451"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=2085><b>sn</b> If the term &#8220;house&#8221; is understood literally, the proverb would mean that one should be financially secure before building a house (cf. NLT). If &#8220;house&#8221; is figurative for household (metonymy of subject: children or family), the proverb would mean that one should have financial security and provision before starting a family. Some English versions suggest the latter meaning by using the word &#8220;home&#8221; for &#8220;house&#8221; (e.g., TEV, CEV).</p>
