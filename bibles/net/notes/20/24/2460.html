At the beginning of the verse the form is the preterite with the <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive; it can be subordinated as a temporal clause to the next verb, probably to be identified as a preterite with the <i>vav</i> &#8211; &#8220;when I saw, I put.&#8221; The next two verbs are both perfect tenses; their construction would parallel the first half of the verse, even though there are no conjunctions here &#8211; &#8220;[when] I saw, I received.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The teacher makes several observations of the state of the sluggard that reveal that his continued laziness will result in poverty.
