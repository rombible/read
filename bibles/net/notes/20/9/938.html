<A NAME="938"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=719><b>tc</b> The text of v. 13 has been difficult for translators. The MT has, &#8220;The foolish woman is boisterous, simplicity, and knows not what.&#8221; The LXX reads, &#8220;A foolish and impudent woman comes to lack a morsel, she who knows not shame.&#8221; The Syriac has, &#8220;a woman lacking in discretion, seductive.&#8221; <i>Tg</i>. Prov 9:13 translates it, &#8220;a foolish woman and a gadabout, ignorant, and she knows not good.&#8221; The Vulgate has, &#8220;a woman foolish and noisy, and full of wiles, and knowing nothing at all.&#8221;</p>
