<A NAME="911"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=692><b>tn</b> There are two ways to take this word: either as &#8220;fools&#8221; or as &#8220;foolish ways.&#8221; The spelling for &#8220;foolishness&#8221; in v. 13 differs from this spelling, and so some have taken that as an indicator that this should be &#8220;fools.&#8221; But this could still be an abstract plural here as in 1:22. Either the message is to forsake fools (i.e., bad company; cf. KJV, TEV) or forsake foolishness (cf. NAB, NASB, NIV, NCV, NRSV, NLT). </p>
