<A NAME="927"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=708><b>tn</b> The word is in the plural in the Hebrew (literally &#8220;holy ones&#8221;; KJV &#8220;the holy&#8221;). It was translated &#8220;holy men&#8221; in <i>Tg. </i>Prov 9:10. But it probably was meant to signify the majestic nature of the <sc>Lord. As J. H. Greenstone says, he is &#8220;all-holy&#8221; (<i>Proverbs</i>, 94). This is an example of the plural of majesty, one of the honorific uses of the plural (see <i>IBHS </i>122-23 §7.4.3b).</p>
