<A NAME="916"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=697><b>tn</b> The word means &#8220;dishonor&#8221; or &#8220;disgrace.&#8221; It is paralleled with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mumo</font>), translated &#8220;abuse.&#8221; The latter term means &#8220;blemish,&#8221; although some would emend the text to read &#8220;reproach.&#8221; The MT is figurative but not impossible to interpret: Whoever tries to rebuke a wicked person will receive only insults and perhaps physical attack. </p>
