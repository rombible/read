<A NAME="936"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=717><b>tn</b> The noun means &#8220;foolishness&#8221; (cf. KJV &#8220;simple&#8221;; NAB &#8220;inane&#8221;). Here it could be classified as a metonymy of adjunct, or as a predictive apposition (when a substantive is used in place of a noun; see R. J. Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, 15, §67).</p>
