<A NAME="944"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=725><b>sn</b> The offer is not wine and meat (which represented wisdom), but water that is stolen. The &#8220;water&#8221; will seem sweeter than wine because it is stolen &#8211; the idea of getting away with something exciting appeals to the baser instincts. In Proverbs the water imagery was introduced earlier in 5:15-19 as sexual activity with the adulteress, which would seem at the moment more enjoyable than learning wisdom. Likewise bread will be drawn into this analogy in 30:20. So the &#8220;calling out&#8221; is similar to that of wisdom, but what is being offered is very different. </p>
