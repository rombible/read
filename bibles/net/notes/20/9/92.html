<A NAME="92"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=683><b>sn</b> Wisdom is personified as a wise woman. She has prepared a house and established it on <i>seven pillars</i>. This is a reference to the habitable world (e.g., 8:31). For the equation of the house and the world, e.g., 8:29; Job 38:6; and Psalm 104:5 (also G. Boström, <i>Proverbiastudien </i>[LUÅ], 1-14). The &#8220;seven pillars&#8221; have been variously interpreted, but since seven is a number for completeness and sacredness, the idea seems to be that wisdom produced a perfect world.</p>
