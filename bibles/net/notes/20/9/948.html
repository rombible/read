<A NAME="948"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=729><b>tc</b> The LXX adds to the end of v. 18: &#8220;But turn away, linger not in the place, neither set your eye on her: for thus will you go through alien water; but abstain from alien water, drink not from an alien fountain, that you may live long, that years of life may be added to you.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The text has &#8220;in the depths of Sheol&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1511;&#1461;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;</font>, <font face="Scholar">bÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">imqe shÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ol</font>). The parallelism stresses that those who turn to this way of life are ignorant and doomed. It may signal a literal death lying ahead in the not too distant future, but it is more likely an analogy. The point is that the life of folly, a life of undisciplined, immoral, riotous living, runs counter to God&#8217;s appeal for wisdom and leads to ruin. That is the broad way that leads to destruction.</p>
