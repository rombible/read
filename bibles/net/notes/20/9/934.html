<A NAME="934"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=715><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a woman of foolishness.&#8221; This could be translated as &#8220;foolish woman,&#8221; taking the genitive as attributive (cf. KJV, ASV, NRSV). But in view of the contrast with the personification of wisdom, this word probably also represents a personification and so can be taken as a genitive of apposition, the woman who is folly, or &#8220;the woman, Folly&#8221; (cf. NIV). For clarity and stylistic reasons the word &#8220;called&#8221; has been supplied in the translation.</p>
