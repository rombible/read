<A NAME="945"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=726><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;bread of secrecies.&#8221; It could mean &#8220;bread [eaten in] secret places,&#8221; a genitive of location; or it could mean &#8220;bread [gained through] secrets,&#8221; a genitive of source, the secrecies being metonymical for theft. The latter makes a better parallelism in this verse, for bread (= sexually immoral behavior) gained secretly would be like stolen water.</p>
