<A NAME="2038"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1746><b>sn</b> The proverb uses antithetical parallelism to teach that diligence leads to prosperity. It contrasts loving sleep with opening the eyes, and poverty with satisfaction. Just as &#8220;sleep&#8221; can be used for slothfulness or laziness, so opening the eyes can represent vigorous, active conduct. The idioms have caught on in modern usage as well &#8211; things like &#8220;open your eyes&#8221; or &#8220;asleep on the job.&#8221; </p>
