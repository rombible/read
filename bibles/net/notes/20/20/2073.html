<A NAME="2073"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">73</span><note=1781><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the steps of a man&#8221;; but &#8220;man&#8221; is the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1462;&#1489;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gever</font>, in pause), indicating an important, powerful person. BDB 149-50 s.v. suggests it is used of men in their role of defending women and children; if that can be validated, then a translation of &#8220;man&#8221; would be appropriate here. But the line seems to have a wider, more general application. The &#8220;steps&#8221; represent (by implied comparison) the course of life (cf. NLT &#8220;the road we travel&#8221;). </p>
