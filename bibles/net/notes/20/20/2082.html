<A NAME="2082"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">82</span><note=1790><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;winnows&#8221; (so NAB, NASB, NRSV). The sage draws on the process of winnowing to explain how the king uncovers and removes wickedness. The verb from which the participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1494;&#1464;&#1512;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿzareh</font>) is derived means &#8220;to separate; to winnow; to scatter&#8221;; the implied comparison means that the king will separate good people from bad people like wheat is separated from chaff. The image of winnowing is also used in divine judgment. The second line of the verse uses a detail of the process to make the point. Driving a wheel over the wheat represents the threshing process; the sharp iron wheels of the cart would easily serve the purpose (e.g., Isa 28:27-28). </p>
