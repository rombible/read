<A NAME="2019"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1727><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;many a man calls/proclaims a man of his loyal love.&#8221; The Syriac and <i>Tg</i>. Prov 20:6 render the verb as passive: &#8220;many are called kind.&#8221; Other suggestions include: &#8220;most men meet people who will do them occasional kindnesses&#8221; (RSV); &#8220;many men profess friendship&#8221; (C. H. Toy, <i>Proverbs</i> [ICC], 384); &#8220;many men invite only the one who has shown them kindness.&#8221; The simplest interpretation in this context is &#8220;many proclaim [themselves to be] a kind person (= a loyal friend).&#8221; The contrast is between many who claim to be loyal friends and the one who actually proves to be faithful. </p>
