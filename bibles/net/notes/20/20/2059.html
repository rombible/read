<A NAME="2059"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=1767><b>tn</b> The form is the Hitpael imperfect (of prohibition or instruction) from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arav</font>). BDB 786-88 lists six roots with these radicals. The first means &#8220;to mix,&#8221; but only occurs in derivatives. BDB 786 lists this form under the second root, which means &#8220;to take on a pledge; to exchange.&#8221; The Hitpael is then defined as &#8220;to exchange pledges; to have fellowship with [or, share].&#8221; The proverb is warning people to have nothing to do with gossips.</p>
