<A NAME="203"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1711><b>sn</b> The proverb does not prohibit the use of wine or beer; in fact, strong drink was used at festivals and celebrations. But intoxication was considered out of bounds for a member of the covenant community (e.g., 23:20-21, 29-35; 31:4-7). To be led astray by their use is not wise.</p>
