<A NAME="2044"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1752><b>tn</b> The verse is usually taken as antithetical parallelism: There may be gold and rubies but the true gem is knowledge. However, C. H. Toy arranges it differently: &#8220;store of gold and wealth of corals and precious vessels &#8211; all are wise lips&#8221; (<i>Proverbs</i> [ICC], 388). But this uses the gems as metaphors for wise speech, and does not stress the contrast between wealth and wisdom.</p>
