<A NAME="2049"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=1757><b>tc</b> The <i>Kethib</i> has the masculine plural form, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1499;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nakhrim</font>), suggesting a reading &#8220;strangers.&#8221; But the <i>Qere</i> has the feminine form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1499;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nakhriyyah</font>), &#8220;strange woman&#8221; or &#8220;another man&#8217;s wife&#8221; (e.g., 27:13). The parallelism would suggest &#8220;strangers&#8221; is the correct reading, although theories have been put forward for the interpretation of &#8220;strange woman&#8221; (see below).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The one for whom the pledge is taken is called &#8220;a stranger&#8221; and &#8220;foreign.&#8221; These two words do not necessarily mean that the individual or individuals are non-Israelite &#8211; just outside the community and not well known.</p>
