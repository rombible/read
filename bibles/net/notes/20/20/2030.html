<A NAME="2030"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1738><b>sn</b> The Hebrew verb translated &#8220;I am pure&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1464;&#1492;&#1461;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">taher</font>) is a Levitical term. To claim this purity would be to claim that moral and cultic perfection had been attained and therefore one was acceptable to God in the present condition. Of course, no one can claim this; even if one thought it true, it is impossible to know all that is in the heart as God knows it.</p>
