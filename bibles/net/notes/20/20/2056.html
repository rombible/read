<A NAME="2056"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=1764><b>tn</b> The clause begins with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) on &#8220;with guidance.&#8221; But the clause has an imperative for its main verb. One could take the imperfect tense in the first colon as an imperfect of injunction, and then this clause would be also instructional. But the imperfect tense is a Niphal, and so it is better to take the first colon as the foundational clause and the second colon as the consequence (cf. NAB): If that is true, then you should do this.</p>
