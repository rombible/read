<A NAME="2026"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1734><b>tn</b> The second line uses the image of winnowing (cf. NIV, NRSV) to state that the king&#8217;s judgment removes evil from the realm. The verb form is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1494;&#1464;&#1512;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mÿzareh</font>), the Piel participle. It has been translated &#8220;to sift; to winnow; to scatter&#8221; and &#8220;to separate&#8221; &#8211; i.e., separate out evil from the land. The text is saying that a just government roots out evil (cf. NAB &#8220;dispels all evil&#8221;), but few governments have been consistently just.</p>
