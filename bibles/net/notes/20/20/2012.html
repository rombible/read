<A NAME="2012"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1720><b>tn</b> The Piel of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>, &#8220;to ask&#8221;) means &#8220;to beg&#8221; or &#8220;to inquire carefully.&#8221; At the harvest time he looks for produce but there is none. The Piel might suggest, however, that because he did not plant, or did not do it at the right time, he is reduced to begging and will have nothing (cf. KJV, ASV; NASB &#8220;he begs during the harvest&#8221;).</p>
