<A NAME="638"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=504><b>tc</b> The MT reads &#8220;make haste to run,&#8221; that is, be eager to seize the opportunity. The LXX omits &#8220;run,&#8221; that is, feet hastening to do evil. It must have appeared to the LXX translator that the verb was unnecessary; only one verb occurs in the other cola.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The word &#8220;feet&#8221; is here a synecdoche, a part for the whole. Being the instruments of movement, they represent the swift and eager actions of the whole person to do some harm. </p>
