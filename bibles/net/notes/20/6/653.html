<A NAME="653"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=519><b>tc</b> The word translated &#8220;woman&#8221; is modified by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ra</font>&#8217;, &#8220;evil&#8221;) in the sense of violating the codes of the community and inflicting harm on others. The <i>BHS </i>editors propose changing it to read &#8220;strange woman&#8221; as before, but there is not support for that. Some commentaries follow the LXX and read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1463;&#1506;</font> as &#8220;wife of a neighbor&#8221; (cf. NAB; also NRSV &#8220;the wife of another&#8221;; CEV &#8220;someone else&#8217;s wife&#8221;) but that seems to be only a clarification.</p>
