<A NAME="634"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=500><b>sn</b> The expression &#8220;high/ lofty [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ramot</font>] eyes&#8221; refers to a proud look suggesting arrogant ambition (cf. NCV &#8220;a proud look&#8221;). The use of &#8220;eyes&#8221; is a metonymy of adjunct, the look in the eyes accompanying the attitude. This term &#8220;high&#8221; is used in Num 15:30 for the sin of the &#8220;high hand,&#8221; i.e., willful rebellion or defiant sin. The usage of &#8220;haughty eyes&#8221; may be illustrated by its use with the pompous Assyrian invader (Isa 10:12-14) and the proud king of the book of Daniel (11:12). God does not tolerate anyone who thinks so highly of himself and who has such ambition. </p>
