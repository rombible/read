<A NAME="658"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=524><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ad</font>) may be taken either as &#8220;on account of&#8221; (= by means of a) prostitute (cf. ASV, NASB), or &#8220;for the price of&#8221; a prostitute (cf. NAB). Most expositors take the first reading, though that use of the preposition is unattested, and then must supply &#8220;one is brought to.&#8221; The verse would then say that going to a prostitute can bring a man to poverty, but going to another man&#8217;s wife can lead to death. If the second view were taken, it would mean that one had a smaller price than the other. It is not indicating that one is preferable to the other; both are to be avoided.</p>
