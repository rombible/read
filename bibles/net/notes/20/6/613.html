<A NAME="613"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=479><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;be bold.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rahav</font>) means &#8220;to act stormily; to act boisterously; to act arrogantly.&#8221; The idea here is a strong one: storm against (beset, importune) your neighbor. The meaning is that he should be bold and not take no for an answer. Cf. NIV &#8220;press your plea&#8221;; TEV &#8220;beg him to release you.&#8221;</p>
