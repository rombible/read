<A NAME="655"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=521><b>sn</b> The description of the woman as a &#8220;strange woman&#8221; and now a &#8220;loose [<i>Heb</i> &#8220;foreign&#8221;] woman&#8221; is within the context of the people of Israel. She is a &#8220;foreigner&#8221; in the sense that she is a nonconformist, wayward, and loose. It does not necessarily mean that she is not ethnically an Israelite.</p>
