<A NAME="660"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=526><b>tn</b> These two lines might be an example of synthetic parallelism, that is, &#8220;A, what&#8217;s more B.&#8221; The A-line describes the detrimental moral effect of a man going to a professional prostitute; the B-line heightens this and describes the far worse effect &#8211; moral and mortal! &#8211; of a man committing adultery with another man&#8217;s wife. When a man goes to a prostitute, he lowers himself to become nothing more than a &#8220;meal ticket&#8221; to sustain the life of that woman; however, when a man commits adultery, he places his very life in jeopardy &#8211; the rage of the husband could very well kill him.</p>
