<A NAME="161"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1326><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;plans of the heart&#8221; (so ASV, NASB, NIV). The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1499;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;&#1500;&#1461;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ma</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arkhe-lev</font>) means &#8220;the arrangements of the mind.&#8221; </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Humans may set things in order, plan out what they are going to say, but God sovereignly enables them to put their thoughts into words.</p>
<A NAME="162"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1327><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[are] to a man.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="163"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1328><b>tn</b> Here &#8220;the tongue&#8221; is a metonymy of cause in which the instrument of speech is put for what is said: the answer expressed.</p>
<A NAME="164"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1329><b>sn</b> The contrasting prepositions enhance the contrasting ideas &#8211; the ideas belong <i>to</i> people, but the words come <i>from</i> the <sc>Lord.</p>
<A NAME="165"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1330><b>sn</b> There are two ways this statement can be taken: (1) what one intends to say and what one actually says are the same, or (2) what one actually says differs from what the person intended to say. The second view fits the contrast better. The proverb then is giving a glimpse of how God even confounds the wise. When someone is trying to speak [&#8220;answer&#8221; in the book seems to refer to a verbal answer] before others, the <sc>Lord directs the words according to his sovereign will. </p>
<A NAME="166"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1331><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;ways of a man.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="167"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1332><b>sn</b> The Hebrew term translated &#8220;right&#8221; (<font face="Hebrewtl">z~E</font>) means &#8220;innocent&#8221; (NIV) or &#8220;pure&#8221; (NAB, NRSV, NLT). It is used in the Bible for pure oils or undiluted liquids; here it means unmixed actions. Therefore on the one hand people rather naively conclude that their actions are fine.</p>
<A NAME="168"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1333><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in his eyes.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="169"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1334><b>tn</b> The figure (a hypocatastasis) of &#8220;weighing&#8221; signifies &#8220;evaluation&#8221; (e.g., Exod 5:8; 1 Sam 2:3; 16:7; Prov 21:2; 24:12). There may be an allusion to the Egyptian belief of weighing the heart after death to determine righteousness. But in Hebrew thought it is an ongoing evaluation as well, not merely an evaluation after death.</p>
<A NAME="1610"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1335><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;spirits&#8221; (so KJV, ASV). This is a metonymy for the motives, the intentions of the heart (e.g., 21:2 and 24:2). </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Humans deceive themselves rather easily and so appear righteous in their own eyes; but the proverb says that God evaluates motives and so he alone can determine if the person&#8217;s ways are innocent.</p>
<A NAME="1611"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1336><b>tc</b> The MT reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1465;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gol</font>, &#8220;commit&#8221;) from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">galal</font>, &#8220;to roll&#8221;). The LXX and <i>Tg.</i> Prov 16:3 have &#8220;reveal&#8221; as if the root were <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">galah</font>, &#8220;to reveal&#8221;).</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;roll.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1465;&#1500;</font> (&#8220;to commit&#8221;) is from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (&#8220;to roll&#8221;). The figure of rolling (an implied comparison or hypocatastasis), as in rolling one&#8217;s burdens on the <sc>Lord, is found also in Pss 22:8 [9]; 37:5; and 55:22. It portrays complete dependence on the <sc>Lord. This would be accomplished with a spirit of humility and by means of diligent prayer, but the plan must also have God&#8217;s approval.</p>
<A NAME="1612"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1337><b>tn</b> The suffix on the plural noun would be a subjective genitive: &#8220;the works you are doing,&#8221; or here, &#8220;the works that you want to do.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1613"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1338><b>tn</b> The syntax of the second clause shows that there is subordination: The <i>vav</i> on <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿyikonu</font>) coming after the imperative of the first clause expresses that this clause is the purpose or result. People should commit their works <i>in order that</i> the <sc>Lord may establish them. J. H. Greenstone says, &#8220;True faith relieves much anxiety and smoothens many perplexities&#8221; (<i>Proverbs</i>, 172).</p>
<A NAME="1614"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1339><b>sn</b> The Hebrew verb translated &#8220;works&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font>, <font face="Scholar">pa</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>) means &#8220;to work out; to bring about; to accomplish.&#8221; It is used of God&#8217;s sovereign control of life (e.g., Num 23:23; Isa 26:12).</p>
<A NAME="1615"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1340><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for its answer.&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1504;&#1461;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lamma</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">anehu</font>) has been taken to mean either &#8220;for his purpose&#8221; or &#8220;for its answer.&#8221; The Hebrew word is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1504;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ma</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aneh</font>, &#8220;answer&#8221;) and not <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lÿma</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">an</font>, &#8220;purpose&#8221;). So the suffix likely refers to &#8220;everything&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1500;</font>, <font face="Scholar">kol</font>). God ensures that everyone&#8217;s actions and the consequences of those actions correspond &#8211; certainly the wicked for the day of calamity. In God&#8217;s order there is just retribution for every act.</p>
<A NAME="1616"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1341><b>sn</b> This is an example of synthetic parallelism (&#8220;A, what&#8217;s more B&#8221;). The A-line affirms a truth, and the B-line expands on it with a specific application about the wicked &#8211; whatever disaster comes their way is an appropriate correspondent for their life.</p>
<A NAME="1617"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1342><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;an abomination of the <sc>Lord.&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿhvah</font>, &#8220;the <sc>Lord&#8221;) is a subjective genitive: &#8220;the <sc>Lord abhors.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1618"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1343><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;every proud of heart&#8221;; NIV &#8220;all the proud of heart.&#8221; &#8220;Heart&#8221; is the genitive of specification; the phrase is talking about people who have proud hearts, whose ideas are arrogant. These are people who set themselves presumptuously against God (e.g., 2 Chr 26:16; Ps 131:1; Prov 18:12).</p>
<A NAME="1619"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1344><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;hand to hand.&#8221; This idiom means &#8220;you can be assured&#8221; (e.g., Prov 11:21).</p>
<A NAME="1620"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1345><b>tc</b> The LXX has inserted two couplets here: &#8220;The beginning of a good way is to do justly, // and it is more acceptable with God than to do sacrifices; // he who seeks the <sc>Lord will find knowledge with righteousness, // and they who rightly seek him will find peace.&#8221; C. H. Toy reminds the reader that there were many proverbs in existence that sounded similar to those in the book of Proverbs; these lines are in the Greek OT as well as in Sirach (<i>Proverbs</i> [ICC], 321-22).</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> The B-line continues the A-line, but explains what it means that they are an abomination to the <sc>Lord &#8211; he will punish them. &#8220;Will not go unpunished&#8221; is an understatement (tapeinosis) to stress first that they will certainly be punished; those who humble themselves before God in faith will not be punished.</p>
<A NAME="1621"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1346><b>sn</b> These two words are often found together to form a nominal hendiadys: &#8220;faithful loyal love.&#8221; The couplet often characterize the <sc>Lord, but here in parallel to the fear of the <sc>Lord it refers to the faithfulness of the believer. Such faith and faithfulness bring atonement for sin.</p>
<A NAME="1622"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1347><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;is atoned&#8221;; KJV &#8220;is purged&#8221;; NAB &#8220;is expiated.&#8221; The verb is from I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kafar</font>, &#8220;to atone; to expiate; to pacify; to appease&#8221;; <i>HALOT </i>493-94 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1508;&#1512;</font>). This root should not be confused with the identically spelled Homonym II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kafar</font>, &#8220;to cover over&#8221;; <i>HALOT </i>494 s.v. II *<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1508;&#1512;</font>). Atonement in the OT expiated sins, it did not merely cover them over (cf. NLT). C. H. Toy explains the meaning by saying it affirms that the divine anger against sin is turned away and man&#8217;s relation to God is as though he had not sinned (<i>Proverbs</i> [ICC], 322). Genuine repentance, demonstrated by loyalty and truthfulness, appeases the anger of God against one&#8217;s sin.</p>
<A NAME="1623"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1348><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;fear of the <sc>Lord.&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿhvah</font>, &#8220;the <sc>Lord&#8221;) functions as an objective genitive: &#8220;fearing the <sc>Lord.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1624"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1349><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;turns away from&#8221;; NASB &#8220;keeps away from.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1625"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1350><b>sn</b> The Hebrew word translated &#8220;evil&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1463;&#1506;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ra</font>&#8217;) can in some contexts mean &#8220;calamity&#8221; or &#8220;disaster,&#8221; but here it seems more likely to mean &#8220;evil&#8221; in the sense of sin. Faithfulness to the <sc>Lord brings freedom from sin. The verse uses synonymous parallelism with a variant: One half speaks of atonement for sin because of the life of faith, and the other of avoidance of sin because of the fear of the <sc>Lord.</p>
<A NAME="1626"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1351><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;ways of a man.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1627"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1352><b>tn</b> The first line uses an infinitive in a temporal clause, followed by its subject in the genitive case: &#8220;in the taking pleasure of the <sc>Lord&#8221; = &#8220;when the <sc>Lord is pleased with.&#8221; So the condition set down for the second colon is a lifestyle that is pleasing to God. </p>
<A NAME="1628"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1353><b>tn</b> The referent of the verb in the second colon is unclear. The straightforward answer is that it refers to the person whose ways please the <sc>Lord &#8211; it is his lifestyle that disarms his enemies. W. McKane comments that the righteous have the power to mend relationships (<i>Proverbs </i>[OTL], 491); see, e.g., 10:13; 14:9; 15:1; 25:21-22). The life that is pleasing to God will be above reproach and find favor with others. Some would interpret this to mean that God makes his enemies to be at peace with him (cf. KJV, NAB, NASB, NIV, NLT). This is workable, but in this passage it would seem God would do this through the pleasing life of the believer (cf. NCV, TEV, CEV).</p>
<A NAME="1629"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1354><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;even his enemies he makes to be at peace with him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1630"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1355><b>sn</b> The lines contrast the modest income with the abundant income; but the real contrast is between righteousness and the lack of justice (or injustice). &#8220;Justice&#8221; is used for both legal justice and ethical conduct. It is contrasted with righteousness in 12:5 and 21:7; it describes ethical behavior in 21:3. Here the point is that unethical behavior tarnishes the great gain and will be judged by God. </p>
<A NAME="1631"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1356><b>sn</b> This is another &#8220;better&#8221; saying; between these two things, the first is better. There are other options &#8211; such as righteousness with wealth &#8211; but the proverb is not concerned with that. A similar saying appears in Amenemope 8:19-20 (<i>ANET</i> 422).</p>
<A NAME="1632"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1357><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the heart of a man.&#8221; This stresses that it is within the heart that plans are made. Only those plans that are approved by God will succeed.</p>
<A NAME="1633"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1358><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his way&#8221; (so KJV, NASB).</p>
<A NAME="1634"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=1359><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kun</font>, &#8220;to establish; to confirm&#8221;) with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsa</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ad</font>, &#8220;step&#8221;) means &#8220;to direct&#8221; (e.g., Ps 119:133; Jer 10:23). This contrasts what people plan and what actually happens &#8211; God determines the latter.</p>
<A NAME="1635"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1360><b>sn</b> &#8220;Steps&#8221; is an implied comparison, along with &#8220;way,&#8221; to indicate the events of the plan as they work out.</p>
<A NAME="1636"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1361><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;oracle&#8221; (so NAB, NIV) or &#8220;decision&#8221;; TEV &#8220;the king speaks with divine authority.&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1462;&#1505;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qesem</font>) is used in the sense of &#8220;oracle; decision; verdict&#8221; (<i>HALOT </i>1115-16 s.v.). The pronouncements of a king form an oracular sentence, as if he speaks for God; they are divine decisions (e.g., Num 22:7; 23:23; 2 Sam 14:20).</p>
<A NAME="1637"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1362><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;on the lips.&#8221; The term &#8220;lips&#8221; is a metonymy of cause referring to what the king says &#8211; no doubt what he says officially.</p>
<A NAME="1638"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1363><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;his mouth.&#8221; The term &#8220;mouth&#8221; is a metonymy of cause for what the king says: his pronouncements and legal decisions.</p>
<A NAME="1639"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1364><b>sn</b> The second line gives the effect of the first: If the king delivers such oracular sayings (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1462;&#1505;&#1462;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">qesem</font>, translated &#8220;divine verdict&#8221;), then he must be careful in the decisions he makes. The imperfect tense then requires a modal nuance to stress the obligation of the king not to act treacherously against justice. It would also be possible to translate the verb as a jussive: Let the king not act treacherously against justice. For duties of the king, e.g., Psalm 72 and Isaiah 11. For a comparison with Ezekiel 21:23-26, see E. W. Davies, &#8220;The Meaning of <i>qesem</i> in Prov 16:10,&#8221; <i>Bib</i> 61 (1980): 554-56.</p>
<A NAME="1640"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1365><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a scale and balances of justice.&#8221; This is an attributive genitive, meaning &#8220;just scales and balances.&#8221; The law required that scales and measures be accurate and fair (Lev 19:36; Deut 25:13). Shrewd dishonest people kept light and heavy weights to make unfair transactions. </p>
<A NAME="1641"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1366><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;stones.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1642"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1367><b>sn</b> The &#8220;wickedness&#8221; mentioned here (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1506;</font>, <font face="Scholar">resha</font>&#8217;) might better be understood as a criminal act, for the related word &#8220;wicked&#8221; can also mean the guilty criminal. If a king is trying to have a righteous administration, he will detest any criminal acts.</p>
<A NAME="1643"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1368><b>tn</b> The &#8220;throne&#8221; represents the administration, or the decisions made from the throne by the king, and so the word is a metonymy of adjunct (cf. NLT &#8220;his rule&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="1644"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1369><b>tn</b> The MT has the plural, even though the verb &#8220;loves&#8221; is masculine singular. The ancient versions and two Hebrew <sc>mss read &#8220;a king.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1645"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1370><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;lips of righteousness&#8221;; cf. NAB, NIV &#8220;honest lips.&#8221; The genitive &#8220;righteousness&#8221; functions as an attributive adjective. The term &#8220;lips&#8221; is a metonymy of cause for what is said: &#8220;righteous speech&#8221; or &#8220;righteous counsel.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1646"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1371><b>tn</b> The MT has the singular participle followed by the plural adjective (which is here a substantive). The editors of <i>BHS</i> wish to follow the ancient versions in making the participle plural, &#8220;those who speak uprightly.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="1647"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1372><b>sn</b> The verse is talking about righteous kings, of course &#8211; they love righteousness and not flattery. In this proverb &#8220;righteous&#8221; and &#8220;upright&#8221; referring to what is said means &#8220;what is right and straight,&#8221; i.e., the truth (cf. NCV). </p>
<A NAME="1648"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=1373><b>sn</b> This proverb introduces the danger of becoming a victim of the king&#8217;s wrath (cf. CEV &#8220;if the king becomes angry, someone may die&#8221;). A wise person knows how to pacify the unexpected and irrational behavior of a king. The proverb makes the statement, and then gives the response to the subject.</p>
<A NAME="1649"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=1374><b>tn</b> The comparative &#8220;like&#8221; does not appear in the Hebrew text, but is implied by the metaphor; it is supplied for the sake of clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1650"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=1375><b>tn</b> The expression uses an implied comparison, comparing &#8220;wrath&#8221; to a messenger because it will send a message. The qualification is &#8220;death,&#8221; an objective genitive, meaning the messenger will bring death, or the message will be about death. E.g., 1 Kgs 2:25, 29-34 and 46. Some have suggested a comparison with the two messengers of Baal to the god Mot (&#8220;Death&#8221;) in the Ugaritic tablets (H. L.

<A NAME="16110"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">110</span><note=1435><b>tn</b> One who is &#8220;slow to anger&#8221; is a patient person (cf. NAB, NIV, NLT). This is explained further in the parallel line by the description of &#8220;one who rules his spirit&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;</font>, <font face="Scholar">umoshel bÿrukho</font>), meaning &#8220;controls his temper.&#8221; This means the person has the emotions under control and will not &#8220;fly off the handle&#8221; quickly.</p>
<A NAME="16111"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">111</span><note=1436><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;who rules his spirit&#8221; (so NASB).</p>
<A NAME="16112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">112</span><note=1437><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;is better than&#8221; does not appear in this line in the Hebrew text, but is implied by the parallelism.</p>
<A NAME="16113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">113</span><note=1438><b>sn</b> The saying would have had greater impact when military prowess was held in high regard. It is harder, and therefore better, to control one&#8217;s passions than to do some great exploit on the battlefield.</p>
<A NAME="16114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">114</span><note=1439><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the lot is cast.&#8221; Because the ancient practice of &#8220;casting lots&#8221; is unfamiliar to many modern readers, the imagery has been updated to &#8220;throwing dice.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The proverb concerns the practice of seeking divine leading through casting lots. For a similar lesson, see Amenemope (18, 19:16-17, in <i>ANET</i> 423).</p>
<A NAME="16115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">115</span><note=1440><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all its decision.&#8221;</p>
