<A NAME="1424"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1152><b>tn</b> The noun &#8220;fools&#8221; is plural but the verb &#8220;mock&#8221; is singular. This has led some to reverse the line to say &#8220;guilty/guilt offering mocks fools&#8221; (C. H. Toy, <i>Proverbs</i> [ICC], 287); see, e.g., Isa 1:14; Amos 5:22. But lack of agreement between subject and verb is not an insurmountable difficulty.</p>
