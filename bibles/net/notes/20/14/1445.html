<A NAME="1445"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1173><b>sn</b> The proverb discusses two character traits that are distasteful to others &#8211; the quick tempered person (&#8220;short of anger&#8221; or impatient) and the crafty person (&#8220;man of devices&#8221;). C. H. Toy thinks that the proverb is antithetical and renders it &#8220;but a wise man endures&#8221; (<i>Proverbs</i> [ICC], 292). In other words, the quick-tempered person acts foolishly and loses people&#8217;s respect, but the wise man does not.</p>
