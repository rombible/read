<A NAME="1451"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=1179><b>tn</b> Many versions nuance the perfect tense verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shakhakh</font>) as a characteristic perfect. But the proverb suggests that the reality lies in the future. So the verb is best classified as a prophetic perfect (cf. NASB, NIV, CEV, NLT): Ultimately the wicked will acknowledge and serve the righteous &#8211; a point the prophets make.</p>
