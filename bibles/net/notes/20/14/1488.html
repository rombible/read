<A NAME="1488"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">88</span><note=1216><b>sn</b> The phrase &#8220;shows favor&#8221; is contrasted with the term &#8220;oppresses.&#8221; To &#8220;show favor&#8221; means to be gracious to (or treat kindly) those who do not deserve it or cannot repay it. It is treatment that is <i>gratis</i>. This honors God because he commanded it to be done (Prov 14:21; 17:5; 19:17).</p>
