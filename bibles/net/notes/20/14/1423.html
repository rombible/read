<A NAME="1423"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1151><b>tn</b> The word means &#8220;deception,&#8221; but some suggest &#8220;self-deception&#8221; here (W. McKane, <i>Proverbs</i> [OTL], 466; and D. W. Thomas, &#8220;Textual and Philological Notes on Some Passages in the Book of Proverbs,&#8221; VTSup 3 [1955]: 286); cf. NLT &#8220;fools deceive themselves.&#8221; The parallelism would favor this, but there is little support for it. The word usually means &#8220;craft practiced on others.&#8221; If the line is saying the fool is deceitful, there is only a loose antithesis between the cola.</p>
