<A NAME="61"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=467><b>sn</b> The chapter advises release from foolish indebtedness (1-5), admonishes avoiding laziness (6-11), warns of the danger of poverty (9-11) and deviousness (12-15), lists conduct that the <sc>Lord hates (16-19), and warns about immorality (20-35).</p>
<A NAME="62"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=468><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my son&#8221; (likewise in vv. 3, 20).</p>
<A NAME="63"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=469><b>sn</b> It was fairly common for people to put up some kind of financial security for someone else, that is, to underwrite another&#8217;s debts. But the pledge in view here was foolish because the debtor was a neighbor who was not well known (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1512;</font>, <i>zar</i>), perhaps a misfit in the community. The one who pledged security for this one was simply gullible. </p>
<A NAME="64"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=470><b>tn</b> The conjunction &#8220;and&#8221; does not appear in the Hebrew text, but is supplied in the translation for the sake of smoothness.</p>
<A NAME="65"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=471><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;struck your hands&#8221;; NIV &#8220;have struck hands in pledge&#8221;; NASB &#8220;have given a pledge.&#8221; The guarantee of a pledge was signaled by a handshake (e.g., 11:15; 17:18; 22:26).</p>
<A NAME="66"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=472><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;stranger.&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zur</font>, &#8220;stranger&#8221;) probably refers to a neighbor who was not well-known. Alternatively, it could describe a person who is living outside the norms of convention, a moral misfit in the community. In any case, this &#8220;stranger&#8221; is a high risk in any financial arrangement. </p>
<A NAME="67"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=473><b>tn</b> The term &#8220;if&#8221; does not appear in this line but is implied by the parallelism. It is supplied in the translation for the sake of clarity.</p>
<A NAME="68"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=474><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yaqash</font>) means &#8220;to lay a bait; to lure; to lay snares.&#8221; In the Niphal it means &#8220;to be caught by bait; to be ensnared&#8221; &#8211; here in a business entanglement.</p>
<A NAME="69"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=475><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;by the words of your mouth.&#8221; The same expression occurs at the end of the following line (cf. KJV, ASV, NASB). Many English versions vary the wording slightly, presumably for stylistic reasons, to avoid redundancy (e.g., NAB, NIV, NRSV, NLT).</p>
<A NAME="610"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=476><b>tn</b> The syntactical construction of imperative followed by an imperative + <i>vav</i> consecutive denotes purpose: &#8220;in order to be delivered.&#8221; The verb means &#8220;to deliver oneself, be delivered&#8221; in the Niphal. The image is one of being snatched or plucked quickly out of some danger or trouble, in the sense of a rescue, as in a &#8220;brand snatched [Hophal stem] from the fire&#8221; (Zech 3:2). </p>
<A NAME="611"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=477><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;have come into the hand of your neighbor&#8221; (so NASB; cf. KJV, ASV). The idiom using the &#8220;hand&#8221; means that the individual has come under the control or the power of someone else. This particular word for hand is used to play ironically on its first occurrence in v. 1.</p>
<A NAME="612"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=478><b>tn</b> In the Hitpael the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1505;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rafas</font>) means &#8220;to stamp oneself down&#8221; or &#8220;to humble oneself&#8221; (cf. KJV, NASB, NIV). BDB 952 s.v. Hithp suggests &#8220;become a suppliant.&#8221; G. R. Driver related it to the Akkadian cognate <i>rapasu</i>, &#8220;trample,&#8221; and interpreted as trampling oneself, swallowing pride, being unremitting in effort (&#8220;Some Hebrew Verbs, Nouns, and Pronouns,&#8221; <i>JTS</i> 30 [1929]: 374). </p>
<A NAME="613"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=479><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;be bold.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rahav</font>) means &#8220;to act stormily; to act boisterously; to act arrogantly.&#8221; The idea here is a strong one: storm against (beset, importune) your neighbor. The meaning is that he should be bold and not take no for an answer. Cf. NIV &#8220;press your plea&#8221;; TEV &#8220;beg him to release you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="614"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=480><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;do not give sleep to your eyes.&#8221; The point is to go to the neighbor and seek release from the agreement immediately (cf. NLT &#8220;Don&#8217;t rest until you do&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="615"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=481><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from the hand.&#8221; Most translations supply &#8220;of the hunter.&#8221; The word &#8220;hand&#8221; can signify power, control; so the meaning is that of a gazelle freeing itself from a snare or a trap that a hunter set. </p>
<A NAME="616"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=482><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;hand&#8221; (so KJV, NAB, NRSV). Some <sc>mss and versions have it as &#8220;trap,&#8221; which may very well represent an interpretation too.</p>
<A NAME="617"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=483><b>sn</b> The sluggard (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1510;&#1461;&#1500;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">atsel</font>) is the lazy or sluggish person (cf. NCV &#8220;lazy person&#8221;; NRSV, NLT &#8220;lazybones&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="618"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=484><b>tn</b> The conjunction <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) here has the classification of alternative, &#8220;or&#8221; (R. J. Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, 71, §433).</p>
<A NAME="619"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=485><b>tc</b> The LXX adds a lengthy section at the end of the verse on the lesson from the bee: &#8220;Or, go to the bee and learn how diligent she is and how seriously she does her work &#8211; her products kings and private persons use for health &#8211; she is desired and respected by all &#8211; though feeble in body, by honoring wisdom she obtains distinction.&#8221; The Greek translator thought the other insect should be mentioned (see C. H. Toy, <i>Proverbs</i> [ICC], 124).</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;its food.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="620"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=486><b>sn</b> The use of the two rhetorical questions is designed to rebuke the lazy person in a forceful manner. The sluggard is spending too much time sleeping.</p>
<A NAME="621"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=487><b>sn</b> The writer might in this verse be imitating the words of the sluggard who just wants to take &#8220;a little nap.&#8221; The use is ironic, for by indulging in this little rest the lazy one comes to ruin. </p>
<A NAME="622"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=488><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;like a wayfarer&#8221; or &#8220;like a traveler&#8221; (cf. KJV). The LXX has &#8220;swiftness like a traveler.&#8221; It has also been interpreted as a &#8220;highwayman&#8221; (cf. NAB) or a &#8220;dangerous assailant.&#8221; W. McKane suggests &#8220;vagrant&#8221; (<i>Proverbs </i>[OTL], 324); cf. NASB &#8220;vagabond.&#8221; Someone traveling swiftly would likely be a robber. </p>
<A NAME="623"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=489><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word for &#8220;armed&#8221; is probably connected to the word for &#8220;shield&#8221; and &#8220;deliver&#8221; (s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1463;&#1503;</font>). G. R. Driver connects it to the Arabic word for &#8220;bold; insolent,&#8221; interpreting its use here as referring to a beggar or an insolent man (&#8220;Studies in the Vocabulary of the Old Testament, IV,&#8221; <i>JTS</i> 33 [1933]: 38-47).</p>
<A NAME="624"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=490><b>sn</b> The terms describe one who is both worthless and wicked. Some suggest that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿliyya</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>) is a compound of the negative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿli</font>) and a noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ya</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>, &#8220;profit; worth&#8221;). Others suggest that the root is from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ba</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>, &#8220;lord [of goats]&#8221;) or a derivative of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bala</font>&#8217;) with reduplication (&#8220;confusion&#8221; or &#8220;engulfing ruin&#8221;), or a proper name from Babylonian <i>Bililu</i>. See B. Otzen, <i>TDOT</i> 2:131-36; and D. W. Thomas, &#8220;<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font> in the Old Testament,&#8221; <i>Biblical and Patristic Studies in Memory of Robert Pierce Casey</i>, 11-19. Whatever the etymology, usage shows that the word describes people who violate the law (Deut 15:9; Judg 19:22; 1 Kgs 21:10, 13; Prov 16:27; et al.) or act in a contemptuous and foolish manner against cultic observance or social institutions (1 Sam 10:27; 25:17; 30:22); cf. NRSV &#8220;a scoundrel and a villain&#8221; (NAB and NIV similar). The present instruction will focus on the devious practice of such wicked and worthless folk. </p>
<A NAME="625"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=491><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;crooked&#8221; or &#8220;twisted.&#8221; This term can refer to something that is physically twisted or crooked, or something morally perverse. Cf. NAB &#8220;crooked talk&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;crooked speech.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="626"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=492><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;walks around with a perverse mouth.&#8221; The term &#8220;mouth&#8221; is a metonymy of cause, an organ of speech put for what is said. This is an individual who says perverted or twisted things.</p>
<A NAME="627"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=493><b>sn</b> The sinister sign language and gestures of the perverse individual seem to indicate any kind of look or gesture that is put on and therefore a form of deception if not a way of making insinuations. W. McKane suggests from the presence of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1465;&#1512;&#1461;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khoresh</font>) in v. 14 that there may be some use of magic here (<i>Proverbs </i>[OTL], 325). </p>
<A NAME="628"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=494><b>tn</b> The noun is an adverbial accusative of manner, explaining the circumstances that inform his evil plans.</p>
<A NAME="629"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=495><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;contention&#8221; is from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">din</font>); the noun means &#8220;strife, contention, quarrel.&#8221; The normal plural form is represented by the <i>Qere</i>, and the contracted form by the <i>Kethib.</i> </p>
<A NAME="630"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=496><b>tn</b> This word is a substantive that is used here as an adverbial accusative &#8211; with suddenness, at an instant.</p>
<A NAME="631"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=497><b>tn</b> The conjunction has the explicative use here (R. J. Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, 71, §434).</p>
<A NAME="632"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=498><b>sn</b> This saying involves a numerical ladder, paralleling six things with seven things (e.g., also 30:15, 18, 21, 24, 29). The point of such a numerical arrangement is that the number does not exhaust the list (W. M. Roth, &#8220;The Numerical Sequence <i>x / x +1</i> in the Old Testament,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 12 [1962]: 300-311; and his &#8220;Numerical Sayings in the Old Testament,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 13 [1965]: 86).</p>
<A NAME="633"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=499><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his soul.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="634"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=500><b>sn</b> The expression &#8220;high/ lofty [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ramot</font>] eyes&#8221; refers to a proud look suggesting arrogant ambition (cf. NCV &#8220;a proud look&#8221;). The use of &#8220;eyes&#8221; is a metonymy of adjunct, the look in the eyes accompanying the attitude. This term &#8220;high&#8221; is used in Num 15:30 for the sin of the &#8220;high hand,&#8221; i.e., willful rebellion or defiant sin. The usage of &#8220;haughty eyes&#8221; may be illustrated by its use with the pompous Assyrian invader (Isa 10:12-14) and the proud king of the book of Daniel (11:12). God does not tolerate anyone who thinks so highly of himself and who has such ambition. </p>
<A NAME="635"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=501><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;a tongue of deception.&#8221; The genitive noun functions attributively. The term &#8220;tongue&#8221; functions as a metonymy. The term is used of false prophets who deceive (Jer 14:14), and of a deceiver who betrays (Ps 109:2). The <sc>Lord hates deceptive speech because it is destructive (26:28).</p>
<A NAME="636"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=502><b>sn</b> The hands are the instruments of murder (metonymy of cause), and God hates bloodshed. Gen 9:6 prohibited shedding blood because people are the image of God. Even David being a man of blood (in war mostly) was not permitted to build the Temple (1 Chr 22:8). But shedding innocent blood was a greater crime &#8211; it usually went with positions of power, such as King Manasseh filling the streets with blood (2 Kgs 21:16), or princes doing it for gain (Ezek 22:27). </p>
<A NAME="637"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=503><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;heart that devises plans of wickedness.&#8221; The latter term is an attributive genitive. The heart (metonymy of subject) represents the will; here it plots evil schemes. The heart is capable of evil schemes (Gen 6:5); the heart that does this is deceitful (Prov 12:20; 14:22).</p>
<A NAME="638"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=504><b>tc</b> The MT reads &#8220;make haste to run,&#8221; that is, be eager to seize the opportunity. The LXX omits &#8220;run,&#8221; that is, feet hastening to do evil. It must have appeared to the LXX translator that the verb was unnecessary; only one verb occurs in the other cola.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The word &#8220;feet&#8221; is here a synecdoche, a part for the whole. Being the instruments of movement, they represent the swift and eager actions of the whole person to do some harm. </p>
<A NAME="639"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=505><b>sn</b> The <sc>Lord hates perjury and a lying witness (e.g., Ps 40:4; Amos 2:4; Mic 1:4). This is a direct violation of the law (Exod 20). </p>
<A NAME="640"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=506><b>sn</b> Dissension is attributed in Proverbs to contentious people (21:9; 26:21; 25:24) who have a short fuse (15:8).</p>
<A NAME="641"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=507><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;brothers,&#8221; although not limited to male siblings only. Cf. NRSV, CEV &#8220;in a family&#8221;; TEV &#8220;among friends.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> These seven things the <sc>Lord hates. To discover what the <sc>Lord desires, one need only list the opposites: humility, truthful speech, preservation of life, pure thoughts, eagerness to do good, honest witnesses, and peaceful harmony. In the NT the Beatitudes present the positive opposites (Matt 5). It has seven blessed things to match these seven hated things; moreover, the first contrasts with the first here (&#8220;poor in spirit&#8221; of 5:5 with &#8220;haughty eyes&#8221;), and the seventh (&#8220;peacemakers&#8221; of 5:7) contrasts with the seventh here (&#8220;sows dissension&#8221;). </p>
<A NAME="642"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=508><b>sn</b> The figures used here are hypocatastases (implied comparisons). There may also be an allusion to Deut 6 where the people were told to bind the law on their foreheads and arms. The point here is that the disciple will never be without these instructions. See further, P. W. Skehan, <i>Studies in Israelite Poetry and Wisdom</i> (CBQMS), 1-8. </p>
<A NAME="643"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=509><b>tn</b> The verbal form is the Hitpael infinitive construct with a preposition and a suffixed subjective genitive to form a temporal clause. The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">halakh</font>) in this verbal stem means &#8220;to go about; to go to and fro.&#8221; The use of these terms in v. 22 also alludes to Deut 6:7.</p>
<A NAME="644"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=510><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;it will guide you.&#8221; The verb is singular and the instruction is the subject.</p>
<A NAME="645"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=511><b>tn</b> In both of the preceding cola an infinitive construct was used for the temporal clauses; now the construction uses a perfect tense with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive. The verb would then be equivalent to an imperfect tense, but subordinated as a temporal clause here.</p>
<A NAME="646"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=512><b>sn</b> The Hebrew verb means &#8220;talk&#8221; in the sense of &#8220;to muse; to complain; to meditate&#8221;; cf. TEV, NLT &#8220;advise you.&#8221; Instruction bound to the heart will speak to the disciple on awaking.</p>
<A NAME="647"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=513><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the commandment&#8221; (so KJV, NASB, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="648"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=514><b>tn</b> The comparative &#8220;like&#8221; does not appear in the Hebrew text, but is implied by the metaphor; it is supplied in the translation for the sake of clarity.</p>
<A NAME="649"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=515><b>sn</b> The terms &#8220;lamp,&#8221; &#8220;light,&#8221; and &#8220;way&#8221; are all metaphors. The positive teachings and commandments will illumine or reveal to the disciple the way to life; the disciplinary correctives will provide guidance into fullness of life. </p>
<A NAME="650"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=516><b>tn</b> The comparative &#8220;like&#8221; does not appear in the Hebrew text, but is implied by the metaphor; it is supplied in the translation for the sake of clarity.</p>
<A NAME="651"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=517><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the way of life&#8221; (so KJV, NASB, NRSV); NIV, NLT &#8220;the way to life.&#8221; The noun &#8220;life&#8221; is a genitive following the construct &#8220;way.&#8221; It could be an attributive genitive modifying the kind of way/course of life that instruction provides, but it could also be objective in that the course of life followed would produce and lead to life.</p>
<A NAME="652"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=518><b>tn</b> The infinitive construct is epexegetical here, explaining how these teachings function as lights: &#8220;by keeping you.&#8221; This verse is the transition from the general admonition about heeding the teachings to the practical application. </p>
<A NAME="653"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=519><b>tc</b> The word translated &#8220;woman&#8221; is modified by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ra</font>&#8217;, &#8220;evil&#8221;) in the sense of violating the codes of the community and inflicting harm on others. The <i>BHS </i>editors propose changing it to read &#8220;strange woman&#8221; as before, but there is not support for that. Some commentaries follow the LXX and read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1463;&#1506;</font> as &#8220;wife of a neighbor&#8221; (cf. NAB; also NRSV &#8220;the wife of another&#8221;; CEV &#8220;someone else&#8217;s wife&#8221;) but that seems to be only a clarification.</p>

This term is a synecdoche of part (eyelids) for the whole (eyes) or a metonymy of association for painted eyes and the luring glances that are the symptoms of seduction (e.g., 2 Kgs 9:30). The term &#8220;alluring&#8221; is not in the Hebrew text, but is supplied in the translation for the sake of clarification.</p>

Most expositors take the first reading, though that use of the preposition is unattested, and then must supply &#8220;one is brought to.&#8221; The verse would then say that going to a prostitute can bring a man to poverty, but going to another man&#8217;s wife can lead to death. If the second view were taken, it would mean that one had a smaller price than the other. It is not indicating that one is preferable to the other; both are to be avoided.</p>

When a man goes to a prostitute, he lowers himself to become nothing more than a &#8220;meal ticket&#8221; to sustain the life of that woman; however, when a man commits adultery, he places his very life in jeopardy &#8211; the rage of the husband could very well kill him.</p>
