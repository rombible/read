<A NAME="41"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=130><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Mordecai.&#8221; The pronoun (&#8220;he&#8221;) was used in the translation for stylistic reasons. A repetition of the proper name here is redundant in terms of contemporary English style.</p>
<A NAME="42"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=131><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;great.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="43"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=132><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;reached&#8221; (so NAB, NLT); KJV, NASB, NIV &#8220;came&#8221;; TEV &#8220;wherever the king&#8217;s proclamation was made known.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="44"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=133><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;great&#8221; (so KJV, NIV, NRSV, NLT); NAB &#8220;the Jews went into deep mourning.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="45"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=134><b>sn</b> Although prayer is not specifically mentioned here, it is highly unlikely that appeals to God for help were not a part of this reaction to devastating news. As elsewhere in the book of Esther, the writer seems deliberately to keep religious actions in the background.</p>
<A NAME="46"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=135><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;were spread to many&#8221;; KJV, NIV &#8220;many (+ people NLT) lay in sackcloth and ashes.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="47"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=136><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;about Mordecai&#8217;s behavior&#8221; are not in the Hebrew text, but are supplied in translation for the sake of clarity. Cf. NIV, NLT &#8220;about Mordecai&#8221;; TEV, CEV &#8220;what Mordecai was doing.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="48"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=137><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;whom he caused to stand before her&#8221;; NASB &#8220;whom the king had appointed to attend her.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="49"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=138><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;concerning Mordecai, to know what this was, and why this was.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="410"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=139><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;given&#8221; (so KJV); NASB, NRSV, TEV, NLT &#8220;issued&#8221;; NIV &#8220;published&#8221;; NAB &#8220;promulgated.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=140><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the words of Mordecai&#8221; (so KJV); NIV, NRSV, CEV &#8220;what Mordecai had said&#8221;; NLT &#8220;with Mordecai&#8217;s message.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="412"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=141><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;one is his law&#8221;; NASB &#8220;he (the king NIV) has but one law&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="413"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=142><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he will live&#8221;; KJV, ASV &#8220;that he may live&#8221;; NIV &#8220;and spare his life.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=143><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the words of Esther&#8221;; TEV, NLT &#8220;Esther&#8217;s message.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="415"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=144><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Mordecai.&#8221; The pronoun (&#8220;he&#8221;) was used in the translation for stylistic reasons. A repetition of the proper name here is redundant in terms of contemporary English style.</p>
<A NAME="416"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=145><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from all the Jews&#8221;; KJV &#8220;more than all the Jews&#8221;; NIV &#8220;you alone of all the Jews.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="417"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=146><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;stand&#8221;; KJV, NASB, NIV, NLT &#8220;arise.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="418"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=147><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;place&#8221; (so KJV, NIV, NLT); NRSV &#8220;from another quarter.&#8221; This is probably an oblique reference to help coming from God. D. J. A. Clines disagrees; in his view a contrast between deliverance by Esther and deliverance by God is inappropriate (<i>Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther</i> [NCBC], 302). But Clines&#8217; suggestion that perhaps the reference is to deliverance by Jewish officials or by armed Jewish revolt is less attractive than seeing this veiled reference as part of the literary strategy of the book, which deliberately keeps God&#8217;s providential dealings entirely in the background.</p>
<A NAME="419"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=148><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And who knows whether&#8221; (so NASB). The question is one of hope, but free of presumption. Cf. Jonah 3:9.</p>
<A NAME="420"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=149><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;have come to the kingdom&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;to royal dignity&#8221;; NIV &#8220;to royal position&#8221;; NLT &#8220;have been elevated to the palace.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="421"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=150><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I and my female attendants.&#8221; The translation reverses the order for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="422"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=151><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;which is not according to the law&#8221; (so KJV, NASB); NAB &#8220;contrary to the law.&#8221;</p>
