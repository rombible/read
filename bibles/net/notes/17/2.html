<A NAME="21"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=47><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;after these things&#8221; (so KJV, NASB, NRSV). The expression is very vague from a temporal standpoint, not indicating precisely just how much time might have elapsed. Cf. v. 21.</p>
<A NAME="22"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=48><b>sn</b> There may be a tinge of regret expressed in the king&#8217;s remembrance of Vashti. There is perhaps a hint that he wished for her presence once again, although that was not feasible from a practical standpoint. The suggestions by the king&#8217;s attendants concerning a replacement seem to be an effort to overcome this nostalgia. Certainly it was to their advantage to seek the betterment of the king&#8217;s outlook. Those around him the most were probably the most likely to suffer the effects of his ire.</p>
<A NAME="23"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=49><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;decreed&#8221; (so NAB, NASB, NRSV); TEV &#8220;and about his proclamation against her.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="24"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=50><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;young women, virgins, good of form.&#8221; The same phrase also occurs in v. 3.</p>
<A NAME="25"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=51><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the house of the women&#8221; (so KJV, ASV). So also in vv. 9, 11, 13, and 14.</p>
<A NAME="26"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=52><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;their ointments&#8221;; cf. NIV, CEV, NLT &#8220;beauty treatments.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="27"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=53><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;who is good in the eyes of the king.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="28"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=54><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the matter was good in the eyes of the king.&#8221; Cf. TEV &#8220;The king thought this was good advice.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="29"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=55><b>sn</b> <i>Mordecai</i> is a pagan name that reflects the name of the Babylonian deity Marduk. Probably many Jews of the period had two names, one for secular use and the other for use especially within the Jewish community. Mordecai&#8217;s Jewish name is not recorded in the biblical text.</p>
<A NAME="210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=56><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
<A NAME="211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=57><b>sn</b> <i>Jeconiah</i> is an alternative name for Jehoiachin. A number of modern English versions use the latter name to avoid confusion (e.g., NIV, NCV, TEV, NLT).</p>
<A NAME="212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=58><b>tn</b> According to <i>HALOT</i> 64 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1502;&#1503;</font> the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1465;&#1502;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">omen</font>) means: (1) &#8220;attendant&#8221; of children (Num 11:12; Isa 49:23); (2) &#8220;guardian&#8221; (2 Kgs 10:1, 5; Esth 2:7); (3) &#8220;nurse-maid&#8221; (2 Sam 4:4; Ruth 4:16); and (4) &#8220;to look after&#8221; (Isa 60:4; Lam 4:5). Older lexicons did not distinguish this root from the homonym I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aman</font>, &#8220;to support; to confirm&#8221;; cf. BDB 52 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1503;</font>). This is reflected in a number of translations by use of a phrase like &#8220;brought up&#8221; (KJV, ASV, RSV, NIV) or &#8220;bringing up&#8221; (NASB).</p>
<A NAME="213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=59><b>sn</b> <i>Hadassah</i> is a Jewish name that probably means &#8220;myrtle&#8221;; the name <i>Esther</i> probably derives from the Persian word for &#8220;star,&#8221; although some scholars derive it from the name of the Babylonian goddess Ishtar. Esther is not the only biblical character for whom two different names were used. Daniel (renamed Belteshazzar) and his three friends Hananiah (renamed Shadrach), Mishael (renamed Meshach), and Azariah (renamed Abednego) were also given different names by their captors.</p>
<A NAME="214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=60><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for there was not to her father or mother.&#8221; This is universally understood to mean Esther&#8217;s father and mother were no longer alive.</p>
<A NAME="215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=61><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;beautiful of form.&#8221; The Hebrew noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">to</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ar</font>, &#8220;form; shape&#8221;) is used elsewhere to describe the physical bodily shape of a beautiful woman (Gen 29:17; Deut 21:11; 1 Sam 25:3); see BDB 1061 s.v. Cf. TEV &#8220;had a good figure.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=62><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;had taken her to him.&#8221; The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">laqakh</font>, &#8220;to take&#8221;) describes Mordecai adopting Esther and treating her like his own daughter: &#8220;to take as one&#8217;s own property&#8221; as a daughter (<i>HALOT</i> 534 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1511;&#1495;</font> 6).</p>
<A NAME="217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=63><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;were heard&#8221; (so NASB); NRSV &#8220;were (had been NIV) proclaimed.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=64><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the house of the king.&#8221; So also in vv. 9, 13. Cf. NLT &#8220;the king&#8217;s harem.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=65><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;was good in his eyes&#8221;; NLT &#8220;Hegai was very impressed with Esther.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=66><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;being looked at (with favor).&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=67><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;of the house of the women&#8221; (so KJV, ASV). So also in vv. 11, 13, 14.</p>
<A NAME="222"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=68><b>tn</b> Cf. v. 20, where the same phrase occurs but with the word order reversed.</p>
<A NAME="223"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=69><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;that she not tell&#8221; (NRSV similar); NASB &#8220;that she should not make them known.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=70><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to know the peace of Esther.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=71><b>tc</b> The LXX does not include the words &#8220;that were required for the women.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to be to her according to the law of the women&#8221;; NASB &#8220;under the regulations for the women.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=72><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;second.&#8221; The numerical adjective <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<i>sheniy</i>, &#8220;second&#8221;) is difficult here. As a modifier for &#8220;house&#8221; in v. 14 the word would presumably refer to a second part of the harem, one which was under the supervision of a separate official. But in this case the definite article would be expected before &#8220;second&#8221; (cf. LXX <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#948;&#949;&#973;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">ton deuteron</font>). Some scholars emend the text to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;</font> (<i>shenit</i>, &#8220;a second time&#8221;), but this does not completely resolve the difficulty since the meaning remains unclear. The translation adopted above follows the LXX and understands the word to refer to a separate group of women in the king&#8217;s harem, a group housed apparently in a distinct part of the residence complex.</p>
<A NAME="227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=73><b>tc</b> The LXX does not include the words &#8220;was pleased with her.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="228"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=74><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;who had taken her to him as a daughter&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;who had adopted her as his own daughter.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="229"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=75><b>tc</b> The Greek <sc>MSS Codex Alexandrinus (A) and Codex Vaticanus (B) read &#8220;twelfth&#8221; here.</p>
<A NAME="230"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=76><b>tc</b> The Syriac Peshitta reads &#8220;fourth&#8221; here.</p>
<A NAME="231"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=77><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;grace and loyal love.&#8221; The expression is probably a hendiadys.</p>
<A NAME="232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=78><b>tc</b> The LXX does not include the words &#8220;more than all the other young women.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=79><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;caused her to rule.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="234"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=80><b>tc</b> The LXX does not include the words &#8220;and he provided for offerings at the king&#8217;s expense.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=81><b>tc</b> The LXX does not include the words &#8220;Now when the young women were being gathered again.&#8221; The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;</font> (<i>shenit</i>, &#8220;a second time&#8221;) is difficult in v. 19, but apparently it refers to a subsequent regathering of the women to the harem.</p>
<A NAME="236"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=82><b>sn</b> That Mordecai <i>was sitting at the king&#8217;s gate</i> apparently means that he was a high-ranking government official. It was at the city gate where important business was transacted. Being in this position afforded Mordecai an opportunity to become aware of the plot against the king&#8217;s life, although the author does not include the particular details of how this information first came to Mordecai&#8217;s attention.</p>
<A NAME="237"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=83><b>sn</b> That Esther was able so effectively to conceal her Jewish heritage suggests that she was not consistently observing Jewish dietary and religious requirements. As C. A. Moore observes, &#8220;In order for Esther to have concealed her ethnic and religious identity&#8230;in the harem, she must have eaten&#8230;, dressed, and lived like a Persian rather than an observant Jewess&#8221; (<i>Esther</i> [AB], 28.) In this regard her public behavior stands in contrast to that of Daniel, for example.</p>
<A NAME="238"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=84><b>tc</b> The LXX adds the words &#8220;to fear God.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="239"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=85><b>tn</b> This individual is referred to as &#8220;Bigthana,&#8221; a variant spelling of the name, in Esth 6:2.</p>
<A NAME="240"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=86><b>tc</b> The LXX does not include the names &#8220;Bigthan and Teresh&#8221; here.</p>
<A NAME="241"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=87><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;guarders of the threshold&#8221;; NIV &#8220;who guarded the doorway.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="242"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=88><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;sought to send a hand against&#8221;; CEV &#8220;decided to kill.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="243"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=89><b>sn</b> The text of Esther does not disclose exactly how Mordecai learned about the plot against the king&#8217;s life. Ancient Jewish traditions state that Mordecai overheard conspiratorial conversation, or that an informant brought this information to him, or that it came to him as a result of divine prompting. These conjectures are all without adequate support from the biblical text. The author simply does not tell the source of Mordecai&#8217;s insight into this momentous event.</p>
<A NAME="244"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=90><b>tc</b> The LXX simply reads &#8220;Esther&#8221; and does not include &#8220;the queen.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="245"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=91><b>tc</b> The LXX adds here &#8220;the things concerning the plot.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the name of Mordecai&#8221; (so NRSV); NIV &#8220;giving credit to Mordecai.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="246"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=92><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they both were hanged.&#8221; The referent (the two eunuchs who conspired against the king) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="247"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=93><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;on a pole&#8221;; KJV, ASV &#8220;on a tree.&#8221;</p>
