<A NAME="57"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=158><b>sn</b> <i>As much as half the kingdom</i>. Such a statement would no doubt have been understood for the exaggeration that it clearly was. Cf. the similar NT scene recorded in Mark 6:23, where Herod makes a similar promise to the daughter of Herodias. In that case the request was for the head of John the Baptist, which is a lot less than half the kingdom.</p>
