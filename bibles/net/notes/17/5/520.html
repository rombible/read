<A NAME="520"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=171><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fifty<i> </i>cubits.&#8221; Assuming a standard length for the cubit of about 18 inches (45 cm), this would be about seventy-five feet (22.5 meters), which is a surprisingly tall height for the gallows. Perhaps the number assumes the gallows was built on a large supporting platform or a natural hill for visual effect, in which case the structure itself may have been considerably smaller. Cf. NCV &#8220;a seventy-five foot platform&#8221;; CEV &#8220;a tower built about seventy-five feet high.&#8221;</p>
