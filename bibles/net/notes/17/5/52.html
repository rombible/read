<A NAME="52"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=153><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the house of the king&#8221;; NASB &#8220;the king&#8217;s rooms&#8221;; NIV, NLT &#8220;the king&#8217;s hall.&#8221; This expression is used twice in this verse. In the first instance, it is apparently the larger palace complex that is in view, whereas in the second instance the expression seems to refer specifically to the quarters from which the king governed.</p>
