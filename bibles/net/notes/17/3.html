<A NAME="31"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=94><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;after these things&#8221; (so KJV, ASV); NAB, NASB, NIV &#8220;After these events.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="32"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=95><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;made great&#8221;; NAB &#8220;raised&#8230;to high rank&#8221;; NIV &#8220;honored.&#8221; </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The promotion of Haman in 3:1 for reasons unexplained contrasts noticeably with 2:19-23, where Mordecai&#8217;s contribution to saving the king&#8217;s life goes unnoticed. The irony is striking.</p>
<A NAME="33"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=96><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;chair&#8221;; KJV, NRSV &#8220;seat&#8221;; NASB &#8220;established his authority.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="34"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=97><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and&#8221; (so KJV, NASB, NRSV). Other modern English versions leave the conjunction untranslated here (NAB, NIV, NCV, NLT).</p>
<A NAME="35"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=98><b>sn</b> <i>Mordecai did not bow</i>. The reason for Mordecai&#8217;s refusal to bow before Haman is not clearly stated here. Certainly the Jews did not refuse to bow as a matter of principle, as though such an action somehow violated the second command of the Decalogue. Many biblical texts bear witness to their practice of falling prostrate before people of power and influence (e.g., 1 Sam 24:8; 2 Sam 14:4; 1 Kgs 1:16). Perhaps the issue here was that Haman was a descendant of the Amalekites, a people who had attacked Israel in an earlier age (see Exod 17:8-16; 1 Sam 15:17-20; Deut 25:17-19).</p>
<A NAME="36"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=99><b>sn</b> Mordecai&#8217;s position in the service of the king brought him into regular contact with these royal officials. Because of this association the officials would have found ample opportunity to complain of Mordecai&#8217;s refusal to honor Haman by bowing down before him.</p>
<A NAME="37"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=100><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Will the matters of Mordecai stand?&#8221;; NASB &#8220;to see whether Mordecai&#8217;s reason would stand.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="38"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=101><b>sn</b> This disclosure of Jewish identity is a reversal of the practice mentioned in 1:10, 20.</p>
<A NAME="39"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=102><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Haman.&#8221; The pronoun (&#8220;he&#8221;) was used in the translation for stylistic reasons. Repeating the proper name here is redundant according to contemporary English style, although the name is repeated in NASB and NRSV.</p>
<A NAME="310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=103><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to send a hand against&#8221;; KJV, NRSV &#8220;to lay hands on.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=104><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they had related to him.&#8221; For stylistic reasons this has been translated as a passive construction.</p>
<A NAME="312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=105><b>tc</b> The entire first half of the verse is not included in the LXX.</p>
<A NAME="313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=106><b>tc</b> This parenthetical phrase is not included in the LXX. Some scholars emend the MT reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">am</font>, &#8220;people&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>, &#8220;with&#8221;), arguing that the phrase is awkwardly placed and syntactically inappropriate. While there is some truth to their complaint, the MT makes sufficient sense to be acceptable here, and is followed by most English versions.</p>
<A NAME="314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=107><b>sn</b> This year would be ca. 474 <sc>b.c. The reference to <i>first month</i> and <i>twelfth month</i> indicate that about a year had elapsed between this determination and the anticipated execution.</p>
<A NAME="315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=108><b>tn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pur</font>, &#8220;lot&#8221;) is an Akkadian loanword; the narrator therefore explains it for his Hebrew readers (&#8220;that is, the lot&#8221;). It is from the plural form of this word (i.e., <i>Purim</i>) that the festival celebrating the deliverance of the Jews takes its name (cf. 9:24, 26, 28, 31).</p>
<A NAME="316"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=109><b>tc</b> The LXX adds the following words: &#8220;in order to destroy in one day the race of Mordecai, and the lot fell on the fourteenth day of the month.&#8221; The LXX reading is included by NAB.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from day to day and from month to month&#8221; (so KJV, NASB).</p>
<A NAME="317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=110><b>tn</b> Since v. 7 seems to interrupt the flow of the narrative, many scholars have suggested that it is a late addition to the text. But there is not enough evidence to warrant such a conclusion. Even though its placement is somewhat awkward, the verse supplies to the reader an important piece of chronological information.</p>
<A NAME="318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=111><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;one people.&#8221; Note the subtle absence at this point of a specific mention of the Jewish people by name.</p>
<A NAME="319"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=112><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;peoples&#8221; (so NASB, NIV); NAB &#8220;nations&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="320"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=113><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to cause them to rest&#8221;; NASB &#8220;to let them remain&#8221;; NAB, NIV, NRSV &#8220;to tolerate them.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=114><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;If upon the king it is good&#8221;; KJV &#8220;If it please the king.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=115><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;let it be written&#8221; (so KJV, ASV); NASB &#8220;let it be decreed.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="323"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=116><b>sn</b> The enormity of the monetary sum referred to here can be grasped by comparing this amount (10,000 talents of silver) to the annual income of the empire, which according to Herodotus (<i>Histories</i> 3.95) was 14,500 Euboic talents. In other words Haman is offering the king a bribe equal to two-thirds of the royal income. Doubtless this huge sum of money was to come (in large measure) from the anticipated confiscation of Jewish property and assets once the Jews had been destroyed. That such a large sum of money is mentioned may indicate something of the economic standing of the Jewish population in the empire of King Ahasuerus.</p>
<A NAME="324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=117><b>sn</b> Possessing the king&#8217;s <i>signet ring</i> would enable Haman to act with full royal authority. The king&#8217;s ring would be used to impress the royal seal on edicts, making them as binding as if the king himself had enacted them.</p>
<A NAME="325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=118><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the silver is given to you&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;the money is given to you&#8221;; CEV &#8220;You can keep their money.&#8221; C. A. Moore (<i>Esther</i> [AB], 40) understands these words somewhat differently, taking them to imply acceptance of the money on Xerxes&#8217; part. He translates, &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s your money.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=119><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;according to what is good in your eyes&#8221;; NASB &#8220;do with them as you please.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=120><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;secretaries&#8221; (so NIV, NRSV, NLT).</p>
<A NAME="328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=121><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;princes&#8221; (so NLT); CEV &#8220;highest officials.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="329"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=122><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;stating that&#8221; are not in the Hebrew text but have been supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="330"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=123><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;children and women.&#8221; The translation follows contemporary English idiom, which reverses the order.</p>
<A NAME="331"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=124><b>tc</b> The LXX does not include the words &#8220;on the thirteenth day.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="332"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=125><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;peoples&#8221; (so NASB, NRSV).</p>
<A NAME="333"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=126><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;runners.&#8221; So also in 8:10, 14. Cf. NAB, NASB, NIV, NRSV &#8220;couriers.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="334"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=127><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;went forth in haste&#8221; (so ASV).</p>
<A NAME="335"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=128><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;with the word of the king.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="336"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=129><b>sn</b> <i>The city of Susa was in an uproar</i>. This final statement of v. 15 is a sad commentary on the pathetic disregard of despots for the human misery and suffering that they sometimes inflict on those who are helpless to resist their power. Here, while common people braced for the reckless loss of life and property that was about to begin, the perpetrators went about their mundane activities as though nothing of importance was happening.</p>
