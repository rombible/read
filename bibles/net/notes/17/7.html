<A NAME="71"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=186><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to drink&#8221;; NASB &#8220;to drink wine.&#8221; The expression is a metaphor for lavish feasting, cf. NRSV &#8220;to feast&#8221;; KJV &#8220;to banquet.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="72"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=187><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;If I have found grace in your eyes&#8221; (so also in 8:5); TEV &#8220;If it please Your Majesty.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="73"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=188><b>sn</b> The passive verb (&#8220;have been sold&#8221;) is noncommittal and nonaccusatory with regard to the king&#8217;s role in the decision to annihilate the Jews. </p>
<A NAME="74"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=189><b>tc</b> The second occurrence of the Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vayyo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">mer</font>, &#8220;and he said&#8221;) in the MT should probably be disregarded. The repetition is unnecessary in the context and may be the result of dittography in the MT.</p>
<A NAME="75"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=190><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;has so filled his heart&#8221;; NAB &#8220;who has dared to do this.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="76"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=191><b>sn</b> There is great irony here in that the man who set out to destroy all the Jews now finds himself begging for his own life from a Jew.</p>
<A NAME="77"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=192><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for he saw that calamity was determined for him from the king&#8221;; NAB &#8220;the king had decided on his doom&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;the king had determined to destroy him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="78"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=193><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;falling&#8221;; NAB, NRSV &#8220;had (+ just TEV) thrown himself (+ down TEV).&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="79"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=194><b>tn</b><i> Heb</i> &#8220;where Esther was&#8221; (so KJV, NASB). The term &#8220;lying&#8221; has been supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons; cf. NAB, NIV, NRSV, NLT &#8220;was reclining.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="710"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=195><b>sn</b> Cf. 1:10, where Harbona is one of the seven eunuchs sent by the king to summon Queen Vashti to his banquet.</p>
<A NAME="711"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=196><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fifty<i> </i>cubits.&#8221; See the note on this expression in Esth 5:14.</p>
