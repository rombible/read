<A NAME="418"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=147><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;place&#8221; (so KJV, NIV, NLT); NRSV &#8220;from another quarter.&#8221; This is probably an oblique reference to help coming from God. D. J. A. Clines disagrees; in his view a contrast between deliverance by Esther and deliverance by God is inappropriate (<i>Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther</i> [NCBC], 302). But Clines&#8217; suggestion that perhaps the reference is to deliverance by Jewish officials or by armed Jewish revolt is less attractive than seeing this veiled reference as part of the literary strategy of the book, which deliberately keeps God&#8217;s providential dealings entirely in the background.</p>
