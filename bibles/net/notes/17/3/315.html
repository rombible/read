<A NAME="315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=108><b>tn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pur</font>, &#8220;lot&#8221;) is an Akkadian loanword; the narrator therefore explains it for his Hebrew readers (&#8220;that is, the lot&#8221;). It is from the plural form of this word (i.e., <i>Purim</i>) that the festival celebrating the deliverance of the Jews takes its name (cf. 9:24, 26, 28, 31).</p>
