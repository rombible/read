<A NAME="313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=106><b>tc</b> This parenthetical phrase is not included in the LXX. Some scholars emend the MT reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">am</font>, &#8220;people&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>, &#8220;with&#8221;), arguing that the phrase is awkwardly placed and syntactically inappropriate. While there is some truth to their complaint, the MT makes sufficient sense to be acceptable here, and is followed by most English versions.</p>
