<A NAME="818"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=214><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;were becoming Jews&#8221;; NAB &#8220;embraced Judaism.&#8221; However, the Hitpael stem of the verb is sometimes used of a feigning action rather than a genuine one (see, e.g., 2 Sam 13:5, 6), which is the way the present translation understands the use of the word here (cf. NEB &#8220;professed themselves Jews&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;professed to be Jews&#8221;). This is the only occurrence of this verb in the Hebrew Bible, so there are no exact parallels. However, in the context of v. 17 the motivation of their conversion (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;the fear of the Jews had fallen upon them&#8221;) should not be overlooked. The LXX apparently understood the conversion described here to be genuine, since it adds the words &#8220;they were being circumcised and&#8221; before &#8220;they became Jews.&#8221;</p>
