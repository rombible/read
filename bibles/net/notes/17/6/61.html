<A NAME="61"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=173><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the sleep of the king fled.&#8221; In place of the rather innocuous comment of the Hebrew text, the LXX reads here, &#8220;And the Lord removed the sleep from the king.&#8221; The Greek text thus understands the statement in a more overtly theological way than does the Hebrew text, although even in the Hebrew text there may be a hint of God&#8217;s providence at work in this matter. After all, this event is crucial to the later reversal of Haman&#8217;s plot to destroy the Jewish people, and a sympathetic reader is likely to look beyond the apparent coincidence.</p>
