<A NAME="226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=72><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;second.&#8221; The numerical adjective <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<i>sheniy</i>, &#8220;second&#8221;) is difficult here. As a modifier for &#8220;house&#8221; in v. 14 the word would presumably refer to a second part of the harem, one which was under the supervision of a separate official. But in this case the definite article would be expected before &#8220;second&#8221; (cf. LXX <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#948;&#949;&#973;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">ton deuteron</font>). Some scholars emend the text to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;</font> (<i>shenit</i>, &#8220;a second time&#8221;), but this does not completely resolve the difficulty since the meaning remains unclear. The translation adopted above follows the LXX and understands the word to refer to a separate group of women in the king&#8217;s harem, a group housed apparently in a distinct part of the residence complex.</p>
