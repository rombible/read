<A NAME="213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=59><b>sn</b> <i>Hadassah</i> is a Jewish name that probably means &#8220;myrtle&#8221;; the name <i>Esther</i> probably derives from the Persian word for &#8220;star,&#8221; although some scholars derive it from the name of the Babylonian goddess Ishtar. Esther is not the only biblical character for whom two different names were used. Daniel (renamed Belteshazzar) and his three friends Hananiah (renamed Shadrach), Mishael (renamed Meshach), and Azariah (renamed Abednego) were also given different names by their captors.</p>
