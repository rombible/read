<A NAME="22"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=48><b>sn</b> There may be a tinge of regret expressed in the king&#8217;s remembrance of Vashti. There is perhaps a hint that he wished for her presence once again, although that was not feasible from a practical standpoint. The suggestions by the king&#8217;s attendants concerning a replacement seem to be an effort to overcome this nostalgia. Certainly it was to their advantage to seek the betterment of the king&#8217;s outlook. Those around him the most were probably the most likely to suffer the effects of his ire.</p>
