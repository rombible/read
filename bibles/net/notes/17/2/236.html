<A NAME="236"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=82><b>sn</b> That Mordecai <i>was sitting at the king&#8217;s gate</i> apparently means that he was a high-ranking government official. It was at the city gate where important business was transacted. Being in this position afforded Mordecai an opportunity to become aware of the plot against the king&#8217;s life, although the author does not include the particular details of how this information first came to Mordecai&#8217;s attention.</p>
