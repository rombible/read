<A NAME="243"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=89><b>sn</b> The text of Esther does not disclose exactly how Mordecai learned about the plot against the king&#8217;s life. Ancient Jewish traditions state that Mordecai overheard conspiratorial conversation, or that an informant brought this information to him, or that it came to him as a result of divine prompting. These conjectures are all without adequate support from the biblical text. The author simply does not tell the source of Mordecai&#8217;s insight into this momentous event.</p>
