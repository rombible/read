<A NAME="29"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=55><b>sn</b> <i>Mordecai</i> is a pagan name that reflects the name of the Babylonian deity Marduk. Probably many Jews of the period had two names, one for secular use and the other for use especially within the Jewish community.
