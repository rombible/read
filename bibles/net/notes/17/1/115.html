<a name="115"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=15><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text of Esther does not indicate why this elaborate show of wealth and power was undertaken. According to the LXX these were &#8220;the days of the wedding&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#7985; &#7969;&#956;&#941;&#961;&#945;&#953; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#947;&#940;&#956;&#959;&#965;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Jai Jhmerai tou gamou</font>), presumably the king&#8217;s wedding. However, a number of scholars have called attention to the fact that this celebration takes place just shortly before Xerxes&#8217; invasion of Greece. It is possible that the banquet was a rallying for the up-coming military effort. See Herodotus, <i>Histories</i> 7.8. There is no reason to adopt the longer reading of the LXX here.</p>
