<a name="125"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=25><b>sn</b> <i>Vashti</i> is the name of Xerxes&#8217; queen according to the Book of Esther. But in the Greek histories of this period the queen&#8217;s name is given as Amestris (e.g., Herodotus, <i>Histories</i> 9.108-13). The name Vashti does not seem to occur in the nonbiblical records from this period. Apparently the two women are not to be confused, but not enough is known about this period to reconcile completely the biblical and extrabiblical accounts.</p>
