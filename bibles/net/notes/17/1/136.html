<a name="136"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=36><b>tc</b> The location of the prepositional phrase &#8220;according to law&#8221; is somewhat unusual in the Hebrew text, but not so much so as to require emendation. Some scholars suggest deleting the phrase as an instance of dittography from the final part of the immediately preceding word in v. 14. Others suggest taking the phrase with the end of v. 14 rather than with v. 15. Both proposals, however, lack adequate justification.</p>
