<A NAME="51"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=152><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;of the house of the king&#8221;; NASB, NRSV &#8220;of the king&#8217;s palace.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="52"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=153><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;the house of the king&#8221;; NASB &#8220;the king&#8217;s rooms&#8221;; NIV, NLT &#8220;the king&#8217;s hall.&#8221; This expression is used twice in this verse. In the first instance, it is apparently the larger palace complex that is in view, whereas in the second instance the expression seems to refer specifically to the quarters from which the king governed.</p>
<A NAME="53"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=154><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the entrance of the house&#8221; (so ASV).</p>
<A NAME="54"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=155><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;she obtained grace in his eyes&#8221;; NASB &#8220;she obtained favor in his sight&#8221;; NIV &#8220;he was pleased with her&#8221;; NLT &#8220;he welcomed her.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="55"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=156><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;What to you?&#8221;; NAB, NIV NRSV &#8220;What is it, Queen Esther?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="56"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=157><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;If upon the king it is good&#8221;; NASB &#8220;If it please the king.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="57"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=158><b>sn</b> <i>As much as half the kingdom</i>. Such a statement would no doubt have been understood for the exaggeration that it clearly was. Cf. the similar NT scene recorded in Mark 6:23, where Herod makes a similar promise to the daughter of Herodias. In that case the request was for the head of John the Baptist, which is a lot less than half the kingdom.</p>
<A NAME="58"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=159><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;answered and said.&#8221; This is somewhat redundant in contemporary English and has been simplified in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="59"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=160><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;if upon the king it is good.&#8221; Cf. the similar expression in v. 4, which also occurs in 7:3; 8:5; 9:13.</p>
<A NAME="510"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=161><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and tomorrow&#8221; (so NASB); NAB, NRSV &#8220;and then.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="511"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=162><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will do according to the word of the king,&#8221; i.e., answer the question that he has posed. Cf. NCV &#8220;Then I will answer your question about what I want.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="512"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=163><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;happy and good of heart&#8221;; NASB &#8220;glad and pleased of heart&#8221;; NIV &#8220;happy and in high spirits.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="513"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=164><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;tremble from before him&#8221;; NIV &#8220;nor showed fear in his presence&#8221;; TEV &#8220;or show any sign of respect as he passed.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="514"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=165><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;sent and brought.&#8221; The expression is probably a hendiadys (a figure of speech in which a single idea is expressed through two words or phrases), in which case the two verbs could be translated simply as &#8220;summoned&#8221; (so NAB) or &#8220;sent for&#8221; (NASB).</p>
<A NAME="515"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=166><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the glory of his riches&#8221; (so KJV, NASB); NRSV &#8220;the splendor of his riches.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="516"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=167><b>sn</b> According to Esth 9:10 Haman had ten sons.</p>
<A NAME="517"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=168><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;caused to come&#8221;; KJV &#8220;did let no man come in&#8230;but myself.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="518"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=169><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;called to her&#8221;; KJV &#8220;invited unto her&#8221;; NAB &#8220;I am to be her guest.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="519"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=170><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his&#8221;; the referent (Haman) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="520"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=171><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fifty<i> </i>cubits.&#8221; Assuming a standard length for the cubit of about 18 inches (45 cm), this would be about seventy-five feet (22.5 meters), which is a surprisingly tall height for the gallows. Perhaps the number assumes the gallows was built on a large supporting platform or a natural hill for visual effect, in which case the structure itself may have been considerably smaller. Cf. NCV &#8220;a seventy-five foot platform&#8221;; CEV &#8220;a tower built about seventy-five feet high.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="521"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=172><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;joyful&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;in good spirits&#8221;; TEV &#8220;happy.&#8221;</p>
