<a name="11"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Paul.&#8221; The word &#8220;from&#8221; is not in the Greek text, but has been supplied to indicate the sender of the letter.</p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2><b>tn</b> Traditionally, &#8220;servants&#8221; or &#8220;bondservants.&#8221; Though <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#959;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">doulos</font>) is normally translated &#8220;servant,&#8221; the word does not bear the connotation of a free individual serving another. BDAG notes that &#8220;&#8216;servant&#8217; for &#8216;slave&#8217; is largely confined to Biblical transl. and early American times&#8230;in normal usage at the present time the two words are carefully distinguished&#8221; (BDAG 260 s.v.). The most accurate translation is &#8220;bondservant&#8221; (sometimes found in the ASV for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#959;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font>), in that it often indicates one who sells himself into slavery to another. But as this is archaic, few today understand its force.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Undoubtedly the background for the concept of being the Lord&#8217;s slave or servant is to be found in the Old Testament scriptures. For a Jew this concept did not connote drudgery, but honor and privilege. It was used of national Israel at times (Isa 43:10), but was especially associated with famous OT personalities, including such great men as Moses (Josh 14:7), David (Ps 89:3; cf. 2 Sam 7:5, 8) and Elijah (2 Kgs 10:10); all these men were &#8220;servants (or slaves) of the Lord.&#8221;</p>

<a name="14"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=4><b>sn</b> <i>The</i> <i>overseers </i>(or &#8220;church leaders,&#8221; L&amp;N 53.71) is another term for the same official position of leadership as the &#8220;elder.&#8221; This is seen in the interchange of the two terms in Titus 1:6-7 and in Acts 20:17, 28, as well as in the parallels between Titus 1:6-7 and 1 Tim 3:1-7.</p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=5><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Grace to you and peace.&#8221;</p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=6><b>tn</b> This could also be translated &#8220;for your every remembrance of me.&#8221; See discussion below.</p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=7><b>sn</b> <i>Your participation </i>(<i>Grk</i> &#8220;fellowship&#8221;) could refer to Paul rejoicing because of the Philippian converts&#8217; &#8220;fellowship&#8221; in the gospel along with him, but it is more likely that this refers to their active &#8220;participation&#8221; with him in the gospel by means of the financial support they sent to Paul on more than one occasion, discussed later in this letter (4:10-19, esp. 4:15-16).</p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=8><b>tn</b> Several alternatives for translating vv. 3-5 are possible: (1) &#8220;I thank my God every time <i>I remember you</i>, yes, always in my every prayer for all of you. I pray with joy because of your participation&#8230;&#8221; (see NAB; also M. Silva, <i>Philippians</i> [BECNT], 43-44; G. D. Fee, <i>Philippians</i> [NICNT], 76-80); (2) &#8220;I thank my God because of <i>your every remembrance of me</i>. Always in my every prayer for all of you I pray with joy. [I am grateful] for your participation&#8230;&#8221; (see Moffatt; also P. T. O&#8217;Brien, <i>Philippians </i>[NIGTC], 58-61). Option (1) is quite similar to the translation above, but sees v. 4a as more or less parenthetical. Option (2) is significantly different in that Paul thanks God because the Philippians remember him rather than when he remembers them.</p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=9><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;since I am sure of this very thing.&#8221; The verse begins with an adverbial participle that is dependent on the main verb in v. 3 (&#8220;I thank&#8221;). Paul here gives one reason for his thankfulness.</p>
<a name="110"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=10><b>tn</b> The referent is clearly God from the overall context of the paragraph and the mention of &#8220;the day of Christ Jesus&#8221; at the end, which would be redundant if Christ were referred to here.</p>
<a name="111"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=11><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;among.&#8221;</p>
<a name="112"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=12><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;it&#8221; is not in the Greek text but has been supplied. Direct objects were frequently omitted in Greek when clear from the context.</p>
<a name="113"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=13><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Just as.&#8221; The sense here is probably, &#8220;So I give thanks (v. 3) <i>just as</i> it is right for me&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<a name="114"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=14><b>tn</b> Or possibly &#8220;because you have me in your heart.&#8221;</p>
<a name="115"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=15><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;in my bonds.&#8221; The meaning &#8220;imprisonment&#8221; derives from a figurative extension of the literal meaning (&#8220;bonds,&#8221; &#8220;fetters,&#8221; &#8220;chains&#8221;), L&amp;N 37.115.</p>
<a name="116"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=16><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;God&#8217;s&#8221; is supplied from the context (v. 2) to clarify the meaning.</p>
<a name="117"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=17><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;brothers,&#8221; but the Greek word may be used for &#8220;brothers and sisters&#8221; or &#8220;fellow Christians&#8221; as here (cf. BDAG 18 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#972;&#962;</font> 1, where considerable nonbiblical evidence for the plural <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#959;&#943;</font> [<font face="Greektl">adelfoi</font>] meaning &#8220;brothers and sisters&#8221; is cited).</p>
<a name="118"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=18><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;for the advance of the gospel.&#8221; The genitive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#8016;&#945;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#943;&#959;&#965;</font> (<font face="Greektl">euangeliou</font>) is taken as objective. </p>
<a name="119"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=19><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;so that the whole imperial guard.&#8221; The <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8037;&#963;&#964;&#949;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jwste</font>) clause that begins v. 13 indicates two results of the spread of the gospel: Outsiders know why Paul is imprisoned (v. 13) and believers are emboldened by his imprisonment (v. 14).</p>
<a name="120"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=20><b>sn</b> <i>The whole imperial guard </i>(<i>Grk</i> &#8220;praetorium&#8221;) can refer to the elite troops stationed in Rome or the headquarters of administrators in the provinces (cf. Matt 27:27; Mark 15:16; John 18:28, 33; 19:9; Acts 23:35). In either case a metonymy is involved, with the place (the praetorium) put for those (soldiers or government officials) who were connected with it or stationed in it.</p>
<a name="121"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=21><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;it has become known by the whole imperial guard and all the rest.&#8221;</p>

To be sure, the pedigree of the witnesses is not nearly as great for the shorter reading (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46 </sup>D<sup>2 </sup>1739 1881 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>), but it explains well the rise of the other reading. Further, it explains the rise of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#965;&#961;&#943;&#959;&#965;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kuriou</font>, &#8220;of the Lord&#8221;), the reading of F and G (for if these <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> had followed a <i>Vorlage</i> with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font>, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#965;&#961;&#943;&#959;&#965;</font> would not have been expected). Further, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font> is in different locations among the <span class="smallcaps">mss</span>; such dislocations are usually signs of scribal additions to the text. Thus, the Byzantine text and a few other witnesses here have the superior reading, and it should be accepted as the original.</p>
<a name="127"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=27><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;thinking to cause trouble to my bonds.&#8221;</p>
<a name="128"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=28><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;But.&#8221; The conjunction <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#955;&#955;&#940;</font> (<font face="Greektl">alla</font>) may be emphatic or contrastive. If the former, the idea may be that Paul will continue rejoicing because of the proclamation of the gospel or because of his imminent release from prison (v. 19); if the latter, Paul is now turning his attention solely to this second reason to rejoice, viz., that he will soon be released from prison. In this latter view the clause should be translated, &#8220;But I will also rejoice since I know&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<a name="129"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=29><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;salvation.&#8221; Deliverance from prison (i.e., release) is probably what Paul has in view here, although some take this as a reference to his ultimate release from the body, i.e., dying and being with Christ (v. 23).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The phrase <i>this will turn out for my deliverance</i> may be an echo of Job 13:16 (LXX).</p>
<a name="130"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=30><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;according to my eager expectation and hope.&#8221; The <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#940;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kata</font>) phrase is taken as governing the following <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joti</font>) clause (&#8220;that I will not be ashamed&#8230;&#8221;); the idea could be expressed more verbally as &#8220;I confidently hope that I will not be ashamed&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<a name="131"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=31><b>tn</b> Or possibly, &#8220;be intimidated, be put to shame.&#8221; </p>

<a name="135"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=35><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;what I shall prefer.&#8221; The Greek verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#7985;&#961;&#941;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jairew</font>) could also mean &#8220;choose,&#8221; but in this context such a translation is problematic for it suggests that Paul could perhaps choose suicide (cf. L&amp;N 30.86).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>I don&#8217;t know what I prefer. </i>Paul is here struggling with what would be most beneficial for both him and the church. He resolves this issue in vv. 24-25.</p>

<a name="140"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=40><b>sn</b> Paul&#8217;s confidence in his release from prison (<i>I know that I will remain and continue with all of you</i>) implies that this Roman imprisonment did not end in his death. Hence, there is the likelihood that he experienced a <i>second</i> Roman imprisonment later on (since the belief of the early church was that Paul died under Nero in Rome). If so, then the pastoral letters (1-2 Tim, Titus) could well fit into a life of Paul that goes beyond any descriptions in the book of Acts (which ends with Paul&#8217;s first Roman imprisonment). Some have argued that the pastorals cannot be genuine because they cannot fit into the history of Acts. But this view presupposes that Paul&#8217;s first Roman imprisonment was also his last.</p>

Paul is here picking up on that motif and elevating it to the citizenship of heaven. Cf. 3:20 (<i>our citizenship is in heaven</i>).</p>

<a name="145"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=45><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;the faith of the gospel&#8221; could mean one of three things: &#8220;the faith that is the gospel&#8221; (genitive of apposition), &#8220;the faith that originates from the gospel&#8221; (genitive of source), or &#8220;faith in the gospel&#8221; (objective genitive).</p>

The dative accents what will happen <i>to the enemies</i> (called a dative of disadvantage [see <i>ExSyn</i> 143-44]), while the genitive accents what the believers will <i>possess</i> (and, in fact, <i>do already</i> possess, as v. 29 makes clear).</p>
