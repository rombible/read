<A NAME="41"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=110><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;brothers.&#8221; See note on the phrase &#8220;brothers and sisters&#8221; in 1:12.</p>
<A NAME="42"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=111><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;faithful fellow worker.&#8221; This is more likely a descriptive noun, although some scholars interpret the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#973;&#950;&#965;&#947;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">suzugos</font>) here as a proper name (&#8220;Syzygos&#8221;), L&amp;N 42.45.</p>
<A NAME="43"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=112><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;in the gospel,&#8221; a metonymy in which the gospel itself is substituted for the ministry of making the gospel known.</p>
<A NAME="44"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=113><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;let your gentleness be seen by all.&#8221; The passive voice construction has been converted to active voice in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="45"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=114><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;will guard the hearts of you and the minds of you.&#8221; To improve the English style, the second occurrence of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8017;&#956;&#8182;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jumwn</font>, &#8220;of you&#8221;) has not been translated, since it is somewhat redundant in English.</p>
<A NAME="46"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=115><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;brothers.&#8221; See note on the phrase &#8220;brothers and sisters&#8221; in 1:12.</p>
<A NAME="47"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=116><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;for you were even concerned, but you lacked opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="48"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=117><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;of contentment&#8221; are not in the Greek text, but are implied by Paul&#8217;s remarks at the end of v. 11.</p>
<A NAME="49"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=118><b>tn</b> The Greek word translated &#8220;all things&#8221; is in emphatic position at the beginning of the Greek sentence.</p>
<A NAME="410"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=119><b>tc</b> Although some excellent witnesses lack explicit reference to the one strengthening Paul (so <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* A B D* I 33 1739 lat co Cl), the majority of witnesses (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>2</sup> D<sup>2</sup> [F G] <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 075 1881 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> sy) add <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8183;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Cristw</font>) here (thus, &#8220;through Christ who strengthens me&#8221;). But this kind of reading is patently secondary, and is a predictable variant. Further, the shorter reading is much harder, for it leaves the agent unspecified.</p>
<A NAME="411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=120><b>map</b> For location see JP1-C1; JP2-C1; JP3-C1; JP4-C1.</p>
<A NAME="412"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=121><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;several times&#8221;; <i>Grk</i>, &#8220;both once and twice.&#8221; The literal expression &#8220;once and twice&#8221; is frequently used as a Greek idiom referring to an indefinite low number, but more than once (&#8220;several times&#8221;); see L&amp;N 60.70.</p>
<A NAME="413"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=122><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Not that I am seeking the gift.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;I do not say this&#8230;&#8221; has been supplied in the translation to complete the thought for the modern reader.</p>
<A NAME="414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=123><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;according to the riches of his glory.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;of his glory&#8221; is treated as an attributive genitive in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="415"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=124><b>tn</b> Or perhaps, &#8220;The brothers and sisters&#8221; (so TEV, TNIV; cf. NRSV &#8220;The friends&#8221;; CEV &#8220;The Lord&#8217;s followers&#8221;) If &#8220;brothers&#8221; refers to Paul&#8217;s traveling companions, it is probably that only men are in view (cf. NAB, NLT). Since v. 22 mentions &#8220;all the saints,&#8221; which presumably includes everyone, it is more probable here that only Paul&#8217;s traveling companions are in view.</p>
<A NAME="416"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=125><b>tc</b> Most witnesses, including several important ones (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A D <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 33 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat sy bo), have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">amhn</font>, &#8220;amen&#8221;) at the end of this letter, while an impressive combination of Alexandrian and Western <sc>mss (B F G 075 6 1739* 1881 sa) lack the valedictory particle. Such a conclusion is routinely added by scribes to NT books because a few of these books originally had such an ending (cf. Rom 16:27; Gal 6:18; Jude 25). A majority of Greek witnesses have the concluding <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font> in every NT book except Acts, James, and 3 John (and even in these books, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font> is found in some witnesses). It is thus a predictable variant. Thus, on internal grounds, with sufficient support from external evidence, the preferred reading is the omission of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font>.</p>
