<A NAME="25"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=56><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;not according to selfish ambition.&#8221; There is no main verb in this verse; the subjunctive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#966;&#961;&#959;&#957;&#8134;&#964;&#949;</font> (<font face="Greektl">fronhte</font>, &#8220;be of the same mind&#8221;) is implied here as well. Thus, although most translations supply the verb &#8220;do&#8221; at the beginning of v. 3 (e.g., &#8220;do nothing from selfish ambition&#8221;), the idea is even stronger than that: &#8220;Don&#8217;t even <i>think</i> any thoughts motivated by selfish ambition.&#8221;</p>
