The same word &#8220;likeness&#8221; is used in both passages. It implies that there is a form that does not necessarily correspond to reality. In Rom 8:3, the meaning is that Christ <i>looked like</i> sinful humanity. Here the meaning is similar: Jesus <i>looked</i> <i>like</i> other <i>men</i> (note <font face="Greektl">anqrwpoi</font>), but was in fact different from them in that he did not have a sin nature.</p>
