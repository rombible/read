<A NAME="215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=66><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;with fear and trembling.&#8221; The Greek words <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#966;&#972;&#946;&#959;&#962;</font> and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#961;&#972;&#956;&#959;&#962;</font> both imply fear in a negative sense (L&amp;N 25.251 and 16.6 respectively) while the former can also refer to respect and awe for deity (L&amp;N 53.59). Paul&#8217;s use of the terms in other contexts refers to &#8220;awe and reverence in the presence of God&#8221; (P. T. O&#8217;Brien, <i>Philippians</i> [NIGTC], 284; see discussion on 282-84). The translation &#8220;awe and reverence&#8221; was chosen to portray the attitude the believer should have toward God as they consider their behavior in light of God working through Jesus Christ (2:6-11) and in the believer&#8217;s life (2:13) to accomplish their salvation.</p>
