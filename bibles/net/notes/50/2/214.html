<A NAME="214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=65><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;and by being found in form as a man.&#8221; The versification of vv. 7 and 8 (so also NRSV) is according to the versification in the NA<sup>27</sup> and UBS<sup>4</sup> editions of the Greek text. Some translations, however, break the verses in front of this phrase (NKJV, NASB, NIV, NLT). The same material has been translated in each case; the only difference is the versification of that material.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>By sharing in human nature. </i>This last line of v. 7 (line d) stands in tension with the previous line, line c (&#8220;by looking like other men&#8221;). Both lines have a word indicating form or likeness. Line c, as noted above, implies that Christ only <i>appeared</i> to be like other people. Line d, however, uses a different term that implies a correspondence between form and reality. Further, line c uses the plural &#8220;men&#8221; while line d uses the singular &#8220;man.&#8221; The theological point being made is that Christ looked just like other men, but he was not like other men (in that he was not sinful), though he was fully human.</p>
