<A NAME="28"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=59><b>tc</b> The bulk of the Western text (D*<sup>,c</sup> F G K it) dropped <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) here, most likely due to ascetic concerns.

The protasis is in verse 1, while vv. 2-4 constitute the apodosis. There is but one verb not in a subordinate clause in vv. 2-4, the imperative &#8220;complete&#8221; in v. 2. This is followed by a subjunctive after <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jina</font>, translated as an epexegetical clause, &#8220;and be of the same mind&#8221;) and three instrumental participles. Thus the focus of these four verses is to &#8220;be of the same mind&#8221; and all that follows this instruction is the means for accomplishing that. </p>
