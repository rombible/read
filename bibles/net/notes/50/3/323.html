Thus, <i>perfect</i> would then be in quotation marks and Paul would then argue that no one &#8211; neither they nor he &#8211; is in fact perfect. The thrust of vv. 1-16 is that human credentials can produce <i>nothing</i> that is pleasing to God (vv. 1-8). Instead of relying on such, Paul urges his readers to trust God for their righteousness (v. 9) rather than their own efforts, and at the same time to press on for the prize that awaits them (vv. 12-14). He argues further that perfection is unattainable in this life (v. 15), yet the level of maturity that one has reached should not for this reason be abandoned (v. 16).</p>
