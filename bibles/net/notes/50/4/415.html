<A NAME="415"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=124><b>tn</b> Or perhaps, &#8220;The brothers and sisters&#8221; (so TEV, TNIV; cf. NRSV &#8220;The friends&#8221;; CEV &#8220;The Lord&#8217;s followers&#8221;) If &#8220;brothers&#8221; refers to Paul&#8217;s traveling companions, it is probably that only men are in view (cf. NAB, NLT). Since v. 22 mentions &#8220;all the saints,&#8221; which presumably includes everyone, it is more probable here that only Paul&#8217;s traveling companions are in view.</p>
