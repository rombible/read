<a name="18"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=8><b>tn</b> Several alternatives for translating vv. 3-5 are possible: (1) &#8220;I thank my God every time <i>I remember you</i>, yes, always in my every prayer for all of you. I pray with joy because of your participation&#8230;&#8221; (see NAB; also M. Silva, <i>Philippians</i> [BECNT], 43-44; G. D. Fee, <i>Philippians</i> [NICNT], 76-80); (2) &#8220;I thank my God because of <i>your every remembrance of me</i>. Always in my every prayer for all of you I pray with joy. [I am grateful] for your participation&#8230;&#8221; (see Moffatt; also P. T. O&#8217;Brien, <i>Philippians </i>[NIGTC], 58-61). Option (1) is quite similar to the translation above, but sees v. 4a as more or less parenthetical. Option (2) is significantly different in that Paul thanks God because the Philippians remember him rather than when he remembers them.</p>
