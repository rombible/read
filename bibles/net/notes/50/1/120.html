<a name="120"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=20><b>sn</b> <i>The whole imperial guard </i>(<i>Grk</i> &#8220;praetorium&#8221;) can refer to the elite troops stationed in Rome or the headquarters of administrators in the provinces (cf. Matt 27:27; Mark 15:16; John 18:28, 33; 19:9; Acts 23:35). In either case a metonymy is involved, with the place (the praetorium) put for those (soldiers or government officials) who were connected with it or stationed in it.</p>
