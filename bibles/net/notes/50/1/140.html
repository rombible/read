<a name="140"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=40><b>sn</b> Paul&#8217;s confidence in his release from prison (<i>I know that I will remain and continue with all of you</i>) implies that this Roman imprisonment did not end in his death. Hence, there is the likelihood that he experienced a <i>second</i> Roman imprisonment later on (since the belief of the early church was that Paul died under Nero in Rome). If so, then the pastoral letters (1-2 Tim, Titus) could well fit into a life of Paul that goes beyond any descriptions in the book of Acts (which ends with Paul&#8217;s first Roman imprisonment). Some have argued that the pastorals cannot be genuine because they cannot fit into the history of Acts. But this view presupposes that Paul&#8217;s first Roman imprisonment was also his last.</p>
