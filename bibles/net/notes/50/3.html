<A NAME="32"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=81><b>sn</b> <i>Dogs </i>is a figurative reference to false teachers whom Paul regards as just as filthy as dogs.</p>

<A NAME="34"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=83><b>tn</b> There is a significant wordplay here in the Greek text. In v. 2 a rare, strong word is used to describe those who were pro-circumcision (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#956;&#8053;</font>, <font face="Greektl">katatomh</font>, &#8220;mutilation&#8221;; see BDAG 528 s.v.), while in v. 3 the normal word for circumcision is used (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#964;&#959;&#956;&#8053;</font>, <font face="Greektl">peritomh</font>; see BDAG 807 s.v.). Both have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#956;&#8053;</font> (the feminine form of the adjective <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#956;&#972;&#962;</font> [<font face="Greektl">tomo&quot;</font>], meaning &#8220;cutting, sharp&#8221;) as their root; the direction of the action of the former is down or off (from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#940;</font>, <font face="Greektl">kata</font>), hence the implication of mutilation or emasculation, while the direction of the action of the latter is around (from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#943;</font>, <font face="Greektl">peri</font>). The similarity in sound yet wide divergence of meaning between the two words highlights in no uncertain terms the differences between Paul and his opponents.</p>
<A NAME="35"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=84><b>tc</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#949;&#973;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">latreuw</font>; here the participial form, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#949;&#973;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</font> [<font face="Greektl">latreuonte&quot;</font>]) either takes a dative direct object or no object at all, bearing virtually a technical nuance of &#8220;worshiping God&#8221; (see BDAG 587 s.v.). In this text, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#957;&#949;&#973;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pneumati</font>) takes an instrumental force (&#8220;by the Spirit&#8221;) rather than functioning as object of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#949;&#973;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</font>. However, the word after <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#957;&#949;&#973;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;</font> is in question, no doubt because of the collocation with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#949;&#973;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</font>. Most witnesses, including some of the earliest and best representatives of the Alexandrian, Western, and Byzantine texts (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* A B C D<sup>2</sup> F G 0278<sup>vid</sup> 33 1739 1881 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> co Ambr), read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">qeou</font>; thus, &#8220;worship by the Spirit of God&#8221;). But several other important witnesses (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>2</sup> D* P <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 075 365 1175 lat sy Chr) have the dative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#8183;</font> (<font face="Greektl">qew</font>) here (&#8220;worship God by the Spirit&#8221;). <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46</sup> is virtually alone in its omission of the divine name, probably due to an unintentional oversight. The dative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#8183;</font> was most likely a scribal emendation intended to give the participle its proper object, and thus avoid confusion about the force of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#957;&#949;&#973;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;</font>. Although the Church came to embrace the full deity of the Spirit, the NT does not seem to speak of <i>worshiping</i> the Spirit explicitly. The reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#8183;</font> thus appears to be a clarifying reading. On external and internal grounds, then, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font> is the preferred reading.</p>
<A NAME="36"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=85><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;have no confidence in the flesh.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="37"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=86><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;though I have reason for confidence even in the flesh.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="38"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=87><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;flesh.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="39"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=88><b>sn</b> A <i>Pharisee </i>was a member of one of the most important and influential religious and political parties of Judaism in the time of Jesus. There were more Pharisees than Sadducees (according to Josephus, <i>Ant.</i> 17.2.4 [17.42] there were more than 6,000 Pharisees at about this time). Pharisees differed with Sadducees on certain doctrines and patterns of behavior. The Pharisees were strict and zealous adherents to the laws of the OT and to numerous additional traditions such as angels and bodily resurrection.</p>
<A NAME="310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=89><b>tn</b> The word here translated &#8220;dung&#8221; was often used in Greek as a vulgar term for fecal matter. As such it would most likely have had a certain shock value for the readers. This may well be Paul&#8217;s meaning here, especially since the context is about what the <i>flesh</i> produces.</p>
<A NAME="311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=90><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;faith in Christ.&#8221; A decision is difficult here. Though traditionally translated &#8220;faith in Jesus Christ,&#8221; an increasing number of NT scholars are arguing that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#962; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pisti&quot; Cristou</font>) and similar phrases in Paul (here and in Rom 3:22, 26; Gal 2:16, 20; 3:22; Eph 3:12) involve a <i>subjective</i> genitive and mean &#8220;Christ&#8217;s faith&#8221; or &#8220;Christ&#8217;s faithfulness&#8221; (cf., e.g., G. Howard, &#8220;The &#8216;Faith of Christ&#8217;,&#8221; <i>ExpTim</i> 85 [1974]: 212-15; R. B. Hays, <i>The Faith of Jesus Christ</i> [SBLDS]; Morna D. Hooker, &#8220;<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#928;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#962; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</font>,&#8221; <i>NTS</i> 35 [1989]: 321-42). Noteworthy among the arguments for the subjective genitive view is that when <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#962;</font> takes a personal genitive it is almost never an objective genitive (cf. Matt 9:2, 22, 29; Mark 2:5; 5:34; 10:52; Luke 5:20; 7:50; 8:25, 48; 17:19; 18:42; 22:32; Rom 1:8; 12; 3:3; 4:5, 12, 16; 1 Cor 2:5; 15:14, 17; 2 Cor 10:15; Phil 2:17; Col 1:4; 2:5; 1 Thess 1:8; 3:2, 5, 10; 2 Thess 1:3; Titus 1:1; Phlm 6; 1 Pet 1:9, 21; 2 Pet 1:5). On the other hand, the <i>objective</i> genitive view has its adherents: A. Hultgren, &#8220;The <i>Pistis Christou</i> Formulations in Paul,&#8221; <i>NovT</i> 22 (1980): 248-63; J. D. G. Dunn, &#8220;Once More, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#928;&#921;&#931;&#932;&#921;&#931; &#935;&#929;&#921;&#931;&#932;&#927;&#933;</font>,&#8221; <i>SBL Seminar Papers</i>,<i> 1991,</i> 730-44. Most commentaries on Romans and Galatians usually side with the objective view. </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>ExSyn </i>116, which notes that the grammar is not decisive, nevertheless suggests that &#8220;the faith/faithfulness of Christ is not a denial of faith <i>in </i>Christ as a Pauline concept (for the idea is expressed in many of the same contexts, only with the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#969;</font> rather than the noun), but implies that the object of faith is a worthy object, for he himself is faithful.&#8221; Though Paul elsewhere teaches justification by faith, this presupposes that the <i>object</i> of our faith is reliable and worthy of such faith.</p>
<A NAME="312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=91><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;in fact&#8221; are supplied because of English style, picking up the force of the Greek article with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pistei</font>). See also the following note on the word &#8220;Christ&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=92><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;based on the faithfulness.&#8221; The article before <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pistei</font>) is taken as anaphoric, looking back to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#8048; &#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#969;&#962; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">dia pistew&quot; Cristou</font>); hence, &#8220;Christ&#8217;s&#8221; is implied.</p>
<A NAME="314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=93><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;based on faith.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=94><b>tn</b> The articular infinitive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#947;&#957;&#8182;&#957;&#945;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">tou gnwnai</font>, &#8220;to know&#8221;) here expresses purpose. The words &#8220;My aim is&#8221; have been supplied in the translation to emphasize this nuance and to begin a new sentence (shorter sentences are more appropriate for English style).</p>
<A NAME="316"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=95><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;to know him, the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=97><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;that for which I also was laid hold of by Christ Jesus.&#8221; The passive has been translated as active in keeping with contemporary English style.</p>

Thus, <i>perfect</i> would then be in quotation marks and Paul would then argue that no one &#8211; neither they nor he &#8211; is in fact perfect. The thrust of vv. 1-16 is that human credentials can produce <i>nothing</i> that is pleasing to God (vv. 1-8). Instead of relying on such, Paul urges his readers to trust God for their righteousness (v. 9) rather than their own efforts, and at the same time to press on for the prize that awaits them (vv. 12-14). He argues further that perfection is unattainable in this life (v. 15), yet the level of maturity that one has reached should not for this reason be abandoned (v. 16).</p>
<A NAME="324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=103><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;reveal this to you.&#8221; The referent of the pronoun &#8220;this&#8221; is the fact that the person is thinking differently than Paul does. This has been specified in the translation with the phrase &#8220;the error of your ways&#8221;; Paul is stating that God will make it known to these believers when they are not in agreement with Paul.</p>
<A NAME="325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=104><b>tc</b> Although <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#957;&#972;&#957;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kanoni</font>, &#8220;standard, rule&#8221;) is found in most witnesses, though in various locations in this verse (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>2</sup> D<sup>2</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 075 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>), it is almost surely a motivated reading, for it clarifies the cryptic <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8183; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183;</font> (<font face="Greektl">tw autw</font>, &#8220;the same&#8221;). Both the fact that the word floats, and that there are other variants which accomplish greater clarity by other means, strongly suggests the secondary nature of any of the longer readings here. Further, the shortest text has excellent and early support in <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>16,46</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* A B I<sup>vid</sup> 6 33 1739 co, rendering it decidedly the preferred reading. The translation adds &#8220;standard&#8221; because of English requirements, not because of textual basis.</p>
<A NAME="326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=105><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Nevertheless, to what we have attained, to the same hold fast.&#8221;</p>
