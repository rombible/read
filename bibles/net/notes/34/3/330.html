<A NAME="330"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=189><b>tc</b> While the MT reads 2nd person feminine singular <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lakh</font>, &#8220;for you&#8221;), the LXX reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8020;&#964;&#8053; </font>(<font face="Greektl">Jauth</font>, &#8220;for her&#8221;). The Dead Sea Scrolls from Wadi Murabba&#8217;at read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1498;</font> (&#8220;for you&#8221;). The MT reading is preferred for several reasons: (1) it is supported by the scrolls from Wadi Murabba&#8217;at; (2) it is the most difficult reading; and (3) it explains the origin of the LXX which probably harmonized this with the preceding 3rd person feminine singular pronoun. Abrupt switches from third to second person are commonly found in poetic and prophetic literature (e.g., Deut 32:15; Isa 5:8; Jer 29:19; Job 16:7) as well as in Northwest Semitic curses (see S. Gevirtz, &#8220;West-Semitic Curses and the Problem of the Origins of Hebrew Law,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 11 [1961]: 147, n. 4).</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;From whence shall I find comforters for you?&#8221;</p>
