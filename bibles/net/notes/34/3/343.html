<A NAME="343"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=202><b>tc</b> The past-time reference of the context indicates that the Pual verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1512;&#1467;&#1496;&#1468;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yÿruttÿshu</font>) is a preterite describing past action (&#8220;they were smashed to pieces&#8221;) rather than an imperfect describing future action (&#8220;they will be smashed to pieces&#8221;). The past-time sense is supported by the Syriac and Vulgate. The LXX, however, misunderstood the form as an imperfect. Not recognizing that the form is a preterite, the <i>BHS</i> editors suggest emending to Pual perfect <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1467;&#1496;&#1468;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ruttÿshu</font>, &#8220;they were smashed to pieces&#8221;). This emendation is unnecessary once the possibility of a preterite is recognized. The Masoretic reading is supported by the reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1496;&#1513;&#1493;</font> found in the Dead Sea Scrolls (4QpNah 3:10).</p>
