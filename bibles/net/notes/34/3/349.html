<A NAME="349"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=208><b>sn</b> This extended simile compares the siege of Nineveh with reapers shaking a tree to harvest the &#8220;first-ripe fruit.&#8221; Fruit that matured quickly and ripened early in the season dropped from the trees more easily than the later crop which developed more slowly (Isa 28:4). To harvest the later crop the worker had to climb the tree (sixteen to twenty feet tall) and pick the figs by hand from each branch. On the other hand, the fruit from the early harvest could be gathered quickly and with a minimum of effort by simply shaking the trunk of the tree (G. Dalman, <i>Arbeit und Sitte in Palestina</i>, 1:378-80). The point of this simile is that Nineveh would fall easily and quickly.</p>
