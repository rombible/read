<a name="177"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">77</span><note=77><b>tn</b> The term &#8220;Assyrians&#8221; is not in the Hebrew text, but is supplied from context for clarity. If left unspecified, the prophetic statement could be understood to mean that the wicked [i.e., wicked conquerors in general] would never again invade Judah. Cf. NLT &#8220;your enemies from Nineveh.&#8221;</p>
