<a name="131"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=31><b>tn</b> The Masoretic disjunctive accent marker (<font face="Scholar">zaqeph parvum</font>) divides the lines here. Most English versions reflect this line division (KJV, RSV, NASB, NIV, NRSV, NKJV). Some extend the line: &#8220;Yahweh is better than a fortress&#8221; (NJB); &#8220;The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is good to those who hope in him&#8221; (NJPS); and &#8220;The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is good to those who trust him&#8221; (NEB). This issue is complicated by the textual problems in this verse.</p>
