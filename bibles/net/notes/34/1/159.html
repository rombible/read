Several other versions (LXX, Syr, Targum) read the plural form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avaru</font>, &#8220;and they will pass away&#8221;). Several scholars emend the MT to the plural form, noting that the next word (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1514;&#1460;&#1498;&#1456;</font>, <font face="Scholar">vÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">innitikh</font>) begins with <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>); they suggest that the plural ending of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;</font> dropped out due to haplography or faulty word division (e.g., T. Longman, &#8220;Nahum,&#8221; <i>The Minor Prophets</i>, 2:798). Another scholar retains the consonantal text, but repoints the form as an infinitive absolute: &#8220;They will be cut off, passing away&#8221; (K. J. Cathcart). On the other hand, more conservative scholars defend the MT reading and try to solve the problem by suggesting a shift from a plural referent (the Assyrians) to a singular referent (God or the Assyrian king): &#8220;They shall be cut down, when he passes through&#8221; (KJV) and &#8220;They will be cut off and he will pass over&#8221; (R. L. Smith, <i>Micah-Malachi</i> [WBC], 77). Still others suggest that the singular form functions as a collective: &#8220;They will be cut off and [they] will pass away&#8221; (W. A. Maier, <i>Nahum</i>, 206; K&amp;D 27:15). <br>However, rather than resorting to textual emendations or performing syntactical improbabilities, the best solution may be simply to posit the presence of a rhetorical, stylistic device. The shift from these plural forms to the concluding singular form may be an example of heterosis of the plural to the singular (see E. W. Bullinger, <i>Figures of Speech</i>, 525 [4.5]). This is a common poetic device used for emphasis, especially at the climactic point in a speech (e.g., Gen 29:27; Num 22:6; 32:25; Job 12:7; 18:2; Esth 9:23; Ps 73:7; Prov 14:1, 9; John 3:11; 1 Tim 2:15).</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;pass away.&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avar</font>, &#8220;to pass through&#8221;) is a key word in Nahum 1; it occurs three times (Nah 1:8, 12, 15 [2:1 HT]). This verb is often used in reference to water, both the raging onset of flood waters (Nah 1:8) and the passive trickling or dwindling away of receding waters (Job 6:15; 11:16).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The phrase <i>trickle away</i> is an example of a hypocatastasis (implied comparison); Nahum compares the destruction of the mighty Assyrians with the trickling away of once high waters. This imagery has strong rhetorical impact because the Assyrians often boasted that they overwhelmed their enemies like a flood. It is ironic then that they would soon dwindle away to a mere trickle! This is also an appropriate image in the light of the historical destruction of Nineveh through the use of flood waters, as predicted by the prophet (Nah 2:7-9) and recorded by ancient historians (Diodorus Siculus, <i>Bibliotheca Historica</i> 2.26-27; Xenophon, <i>Anabasis</i> 3.4.12; also see P. Haupt, &#8220;Xenophon&#8217;s Account of the Fall of Nineveh,&#8221; <i>JAOS</i> 28 [1907]: 99-107).</p>
