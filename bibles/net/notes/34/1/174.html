<a name="174"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">74</span><note=74><b>sn</b> The <i>sacred vows to praise God</i> were often made by Israelites as a pledge to proclaim the mercy of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> if he would be gracious to deliver (e.g., Gen 28:20; 31:13; Lev 7:16; Judg 11:30, 39; 1 Sam 1:11, 21; 2 Sam 15:7-8; Pss 22:25 [26]; 50:14; 56:12 [13]; 61:5 [6], 8 [9]; 65:1 [2]; 66:13; 116:14, 18; Eccl 5:4 [3]; Jonah 1:16; 2:9 [10]). The words &#8220;to praise God&#8221; are not in the Hebrew, but are added in the translation for clarification.</p>
