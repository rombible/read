Most English versions render it as &#8220;know&#8221; here (KJV, RSV, NASB, NKJV) but at least two recognize the nuance &#8220;protect&#8221; (NRSV, NIV [which reads &#8220;cares for&#8221;]). It often refers to God protecting and caring for his people (2 Sam 7:20; Ps 144:3). When the subject is a king (suzerain) and the object is a servant (vassal), it often has covenantal overtones. In several ancient Near Eastern languages this term depicts the king (suzerain) recognizing his treaty obligation to protect and rescue his servant (vassal) from its enemies. For example, a letter from Abdi-Ashirta governor of Ammuru to the Egyptian king Amenophis III ends with a plea for protection from the raids of the Mittani: &#8220;May the king my lord <i>know</i> [= protect] me&#8221; (<font face="Scholar">yi</font>-<font face="Scholar">da</font>-<font face="Scholar">an</font>-<font face="Scholar">ni</font>; <i>EA</i> 60:30-32). Similarly, in the treaty between Muwattallis and Alaksandus, the Hittite suzerain assures his vassal that in case he was attacked, &#8220;As he is an enemy of you, even so he is an enemy to the Sun; I the Sun, will <i>know</i> [= &#8220;protect&#8221;] only you, Alaksandus&#8221; (see H. B. Huffmon, &#8220;The Treaty Background of Hebrew YADA`,&#8221; <i>BASOR</i> 181 (1966): 31-37; idem, &#8220;A Further Note on the Treaty Background of Hebrew YADA`,&#8221; <i>BASOR</i> 184 (1966): 36-38.</p>
