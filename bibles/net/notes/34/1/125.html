The Hebrew verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">amad</font>, &#8220;stand&#8221;) here denotes &#8220;to resist, withstand.&#8221; It is used elsewhere of warriors taking a stand in battle to hold their ground against enemies (Judg 2:14; Josh 10:8; 21:44; 23:9; 2 Kgs 10:4; Dan 11:16; Amos 2:15). It is also used of people trying to protect their lives from enemy attack (Esth 8:11; 9:16). Like a mighty warrior, the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will attack his enemies, but none will be able to make a stand against him; none will be able to hold their ground against him; and none will be able to protect themselves from his onslaught (Pss 76:7[8]; 147:17; Mal 3:2).</p>
