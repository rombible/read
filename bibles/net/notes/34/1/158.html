It is used figuratively here to describe the destruction of the Assyrian army (BDB 159 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1494;&#1463;&#1494;</font>; <i>HALOT</i> 186 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1494;&#1494;</font>).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The expression <i>they will be cut off</i> is an example of a hypocatastasis (implied comparison); Nahum intentionally chose this term to compare the destruction of the Assyrians to the shearing of sheep. This word-play has great rhetorical impact because the Assyrians frequently used sheep imagery when boasting of the ease and brutality with which they defeated their enemies (see D. Marcus, &#8220;Animal Similes in Assyrian Royal Inscriptions,&#8221; <i>Or</i> 46 [1977]: 92-93). It is both appropriate (poetic justice) and ironic (reversal of situation) that the Assyrians themselves should suffer a fate which they boasted of inflicting upon others. They will be an easy, helpless prey for the Divine Warrior. Their punishment will fit their crimes.</p>
