<a name="152"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=52><b>sn</b> Verse 12 begins with a typical prophetic introduction (&#8220;This is what the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> says&#8221;) in language similar to the typical ancient Near Eastern messenger formula (see C. Westermann, <i>Basic Forms of Prophetic Speeches</i>, 100-115). This formula is frequently used to introduce prophetic speeches (e.g., Jer 2:5; Ezek 2:4; Amos 1:3). The messenger formula indicates that the prophet&#8217;s message is not his own, but is a revelatory and prophetic oracle from the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. It confirms the authenticity of the message.</p>
