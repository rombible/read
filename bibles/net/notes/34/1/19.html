<a name="19"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=9><b>tc</b> The <i>BHS</i> editors suggest emending MT &#8220;power&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1495;&#1463;</font>, <font face="Scholar">koakh</font>) to &#8220;mercy&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1462;&#1505;&#1462;&#1491;</font>, <font face="Scholar">khesed</font>) as in Exod 34:6; Num 14:18; Joel 2:13; Jonah 4:2; Ps 103:8; Neh 9:17. However, this is unnecessary, it has no textual support, and it misses the rhetorical point intended by Nahum&#8217;s modification of the traditional expression.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This is an allusion to the well-known statement, &#8220;The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is slow to anger but great in mercy&#8221; (Exod 34:6; Num 14:18; Joel 2:13; Jonah 4:2; Ps 103:8; Neh 9:17). Nahum subtly modifies this by substituting &#8220;great in mercy&#8221; with &#8220;great in power.&#8221; God&#8217;s patience at the time of Jonah (Jonah 4:2) one century earlier (ca. 750 <span class="smallcaps">b.c.</span>), had run out. Nineveh had exhausted the &#8220;great mercy&#8221; of God and now would experience the &#8220;great power&#8221; of God. </p>
