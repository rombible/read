<a name="167"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=67><b>tn</b> <i>Heb </i>&#8220;has commanded concerning you.&#8221; The referent of the 2nd person masculine singular suffix (&#8220;you&#8221;) probably refers to the Assyrian king (cf. 3:18-19) rather than to the personified city of Nineveh (so NIV). Elsewhere in the book of Nahum, the city of Nineveh is referred to by the feminine rather than masculine gender. Some modern English versions supply terms not in the Hebrew text to indicate the addressee more clearly: NIV &#8220;Nineveh&#8221;; NLT &#8220;the Assyrians in Nineveh.&#8221;</p>
