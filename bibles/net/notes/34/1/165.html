<a name="165"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=65><b>sn</b> The phrase <i>the shackles that are on you</i> draws an implied comparison between the chains and stocks of prisoners or slaves with the burden of international vassaldom to a tyrannical suzerain who demands absolute obedience and requires annual tributary offerings (e.g., Ps 2:3; Isa 52:2; Jer 27:2; 30:8). &#8220;Shackles&#8221; were the agent of covenantal discipline (e.g., Deut 28:48). Isaiah stated that the Assyrian &#8220;yoke&#8221; was the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&#8217;s instrument of discipline (Isa 28:22). The phrase <i>I will tear apart the shackles that are on you</i> draws an implied comparison (hypocatastasis) between removing the iron chains from a prisoner/slave and freeing a vassal from the oppression of a tyrannical suzerain through military conquest (Ps 2:3; Isa 52:2).</p>
