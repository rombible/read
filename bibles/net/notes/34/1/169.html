<a name="169"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">69</span><note=69><b>tn</b> The MT reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501; &#1511;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1462;&#1498;&#1464;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">asim qivrekha</font>, &#8220;I will make your grave&#8221;) is usually understood as a figure of speech (metonymy of effect) meaning that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will destroy/execute the Assyrian king. On the other hand, the Targum and Syriac treat this as a double-accusative construction &#8211; the implied second object of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> being <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514; &#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1462;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mibbet </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elohekha</font>, &#8220;the house [i.e., &#8220;temple&#8221;] of your gods&#8221;): &#8220;I will make it [the house (i.e., temple) of your gods] your grave.&#8221; Cathcart suggests revocalizing the MT <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> to a Hiphil imperfect <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ashiyim</font>) from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1461;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shamem</font>, &#8220;to devastate&#8221;): &#8220;I will devastate your grave.&#8221; Cathcart notes that the destruction of one&#8217;s grave, like the threat of no burial, was a common ancient Near Eastern treaty-curse: &#8220;Tombs, especially royal tombs, were often protected by curses directed against persons who might violate and desecrate them, and the very curse kings used to have inscribed on their tombs were precisely the curse of no progeny and no resting-place&#8221; (K. J. Cathcart, &#8220;Treaty-Curses and the Book of Nahum,&#8221; <i>CBQ</i> 35 [1973]: 180-81). This might reflect the background of the ancient Near Eastern <font face="Scholar">kudurru</font> curses which were made against those who might devastate a royal grave and which were put into effect by the gods of the king (see F. C. Fensham, &#8220;Common Trends in Curses of the Near Eastern Treaties and Kudurru-Inscriptions Compared with Maledictions of Amos and Isaiah,&#8221; <i>ZAW</i> 75 [1963]: 157-59). Despite the fact the king&#8217;s grave was allegedly protected by the Assyrian gods, the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> would nevertheless successfully destroy it, and it would be the Assyrian king who would receive the curse. This approach respects the traditional consonantal text and only involves the revocalization of the MT&#8217;s <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sin</font>) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shin</font>).</p>
