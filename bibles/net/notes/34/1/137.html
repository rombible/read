<a name="137"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=37><b>tn</b> Some scholars connect &#8220;in an overwhelming flood&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1496;&#1462;&#1507; &#1506;&#1465;&#1489;&#1461;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">uvÿshetef </font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">over</font>) with the preceding line: &#8220;he protects those who trust him in an overwhelming flood.&#8221; However, others connect it with the following line: &#8220;But with an overwhelming flood he will make a complete end of its [Nineveh&#8217;s] site.&#8221; D. T. Tsumura (&#8220;Janus Parallelism in Nah 1:8,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 102 [1983]: 109-11) suggests that it does double duty and should be read with both lines: &#8220;he knows those who trust him in an overwhelming flood, / but with an overwhelming flood he will make a complete end of its [Nineveh&#8217;s] site.&#8221; Connecting it with the preceding line creates a tight parallelism and a balanced 5+5 metrical count. Connecting it with the following line harmonizes with Nah 2:9 [8], which describes the walls of Nineveh being destroyed by flood waters, and with historical evidence (Diodorus Siculus, <i>Bibliotheca Historica</i>, 2.27.1-3; Xenophon, <i>Anabasis</i>, 3.4.12) and modern archaeological evidence (A. T. Olmstead, <i>History of Assyria</i>, 637). This might be an example of intentional ambiguity: God will protect his people from the very calamity that he will use to destroy his enemies.</p>
