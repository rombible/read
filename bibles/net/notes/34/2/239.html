Nahum pictures the river banks inside Nineveh overflowing in a torrent, crashing into the royal palace and eroding its limestone slab foundations.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Ironically, a few decades earlier, Sennacherib engaged in a program of flood control because the Tebiltu River often flooded its banks inside Nineveh and undermined the palace foundations. Sennacherib also had to strengthen the foundations of his palace with &#8220;mighty slabs of limestone&#8221; so that &#8220;its foundation would not be weakened by the flood of high water&#8221; (D. D. Luckenbill, <i>Ancient Records of Assyria and Babylon</i>, 99-100). At the time of the fall of Nineveh, the Palace of Ashurbanipal was located on the edge of the sharpest bend of the Khoser River as it flowed through the city; when the Khoser overflowed its banks, the palace foundation was weakened (J. Reade, &#8220;Studies in Assyrian Geography, Part I: Sennacherib and the Waters of Nineveh,&#8221; <i>RA</i> 72 [1978]: 51).</p>
