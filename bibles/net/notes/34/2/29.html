<A NAME="29"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=89><b>tn</b> The Qal perfect <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shav</font>, &#8220;restore, return&#8221;) is an example of the so-called &#8220;prophetic perfect.&#8221; In this case, the perfect tense does not denote past-time action, but a future-time action that is pictured as complete (certain) and independent (not contingent upon other factors). The so-called &#8220;prophetic perfect&#8221; or &#8220;perfect of confidence&#8221; vividly expresses a future action that is deemed &#8220;as good as done&#8221; (Num 24:17; Isa 5:13; 8:23-9:1). See R. J. Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, 33, §165; <i>IBHS</i> 489-90 §30.5.1. Though the transitive use of the Qal of this verb is problematic, most scholars derive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1489;</font> from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shuv</font>, &#8220;to turn, to return, to restore&#8221;). However, W. A. Maier (<i>Nahum</i>, 232) contends that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1489;</font> is derived from I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shavav</font>, &#8220;to cut off, to destroy, to smite&#8221;) which is related to Arabic <font face="Scholar">sabba</font> (&#8220;to cut&#8221;), Aramaic <font face="Scholar">sibba</font>&#8217;(&#8220;splinter&#8221;), and New Hebrew. Maier admits that this would be the only occurrence of a verb from I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1489;</font> in the OT; however, he argues that the appearance of the plural noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shÿvavim</font>, &#8220;splinters&#8221;) in Hos 8:6 provides adequate support. There are several problems with Maier&#8217;s proposal. First, his support from Arabic, Aramaic (Targum) and New Hebrew is all late. Second, it creates a <i>hapax</i> <i>legomenon</i> (a word that occurs only once in the Hebrew Bible) for a well-known Hebrew word which frequently appears in climactic contexts in prophetic speeches, as here. Third, the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shuv</font>, &#8220;to turn, to return, to restore&#8221;) makes perfectly good sense in this context. The meaning of this usage of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1489;</font> (from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;</font>) is debated. The LXX took it in the negative sense &#8220;has turned aside.&#8221; On the other hand, it is nuanced in a positive, salvific sense by the Vulgate, Targum, and Syriac. The salvific nuance is best for the following reasons: (1) its direct object is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1456;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ge</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">on</font>) which should be understood in the positive sense of &#8220;majesty; exaltation; glory&#8221; (see following note on the word &#8220;majesty&#8221;); (2) the motive clause introduced by causative/ explanatory <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>, &#8220;for&#8221;) would make little sense, saying that the reason the <sc>Lord was about to destroy Nineveh was because he had turned away the pride of Judah; however, it makes good sense to say that the <sc>Lord would destroy Nineveh because he was about to deliver Judah; and (3) a reference to the <sc>Lord turning aside from Judah would be out of harmony with the rest of the book.</p>
