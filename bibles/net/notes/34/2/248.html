<A NAME="248"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=128><b>tn</b> The term &#8220;pool&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1499;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">bÿrekhah</font>) usually refers to a man-made artificial water reservoir fed by water aqueducts rather than to a natural pond (<i>HALOT</i> 161 s.v.). For example, it is used in reference to man-made water reservoirs for the royal gardens (Eccl 2:6; Neh 2:14); man-made water reservoirs in Jerusalem, some of which were fed by aqueducts (2 Kgs 18:17; 20:20; Isa 7:3; 22:9, 11; 36:2; Neh 3:15, 16); the pool of Gibeon (2 Sam 2:13); the pool of Hebron (2 Sam 4:12); the pool of Samaria (1 Kgs 22:38); and the pools of Heshbon (Song 7:5). The pool of Siloam, built by Hezekiah and fed by the underground aqueduct known as Hezekiah&#8217;s Tunnel, is designated by the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1499;&#1464;&#1492;</font> in 2 Kgs 20:20 and the Siloam Inscription (line 5).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Nineveh was like a pool of water</i>. This is an appropriate simile because Nineveh was famous for its artificial pools, many of which serviced the royal gardens. Two rivers also flowed through the city: the Tebiltu and the Khoser.</p>
