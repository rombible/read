<A NAME="237"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=117><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;mantelet.&#8221; The Hebrew noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1465;&#1499;&#1461;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sokhekh</font>, &#8220;mantelet&#8221;) is a military technical term referring to a large movable shelter used as a protective cover for soldiers besieging a fortified city, designed to shield them from the arrows shot down from the city wall (<i>HALOT</i> 754 s.v.; BDB 697 s.v.). This noun is a <i>hapax</i> <i>legomenon</i> (a word that only occurs once in the Hebrew Bible) and is derived from the verb III <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sakhakh</font>, &#8220;to cover; to protect&#8221;; <i>TWOT</i> 2:623-24). K. J. Cathcart (<i>Nahum in the Light of Northwest Semitic </i>[BibOr], 95) suggests that the translation &#8220;mantelet&#8221; is supported by the use of the verb III <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> in Ps 140:7 [8]: &#8220;Yahweh, my Lord, my fortress of safety; shelter (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">sakotah</font>) my head in the day of arms.&#8221; This is reflected in several recent English versions: &#8220;wheeled shelters&#8221; (NJPS), &#8220;protective shield&#8221; (NIV), &#8220;covering used in a siege&#8221; (NASB margin), and &#8220;mantelet&#8221; (ASV, NAB, NASB, NRSV). Cf. also TEV &#8220;the shield for the battering ram.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The Hebrew term translated <i>covered siege tower</i> probably does not refer to a battering ram, but to a movable protective tower, used to cover the soldiers and the siege machinery. These are frequently depicted in Neo-Assyrian bas-reliefs, such as the relief of Sennacherib&#8217;s siege of Lachish. The Neo-Assyrians used both small, hut-like shelters that could be carried by a few men, as well as larger, tower-like structures rolled on wheels to the top of siege embankments. These mantelets protected the attackers while they built the embankments and undermined the foundations of the city walls to hasten their collapse. Siege towers were equipped with machines designed to hurl stones to smash the fortifications and firebrands to start conflagrations (see A. H. Layard, <i>Nineveh and Its Remains</i>, 2:281-86).</p>
