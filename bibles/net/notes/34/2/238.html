C. Thompson and R. W. Hutchinson, <i>A Century of Exploration at Nineveh</i>, 120-132). However, the Tebiltu often flooded its banks inside the city, undermining palace foundations and weakening other structures. To reduce this flooding, Sennacherib changed the course of the Tebiltu inside the city. Outside the city, he dammed up the Khoser and created a reservoir, regulating the flow of water into the city through an elaborate system of double sluice gates (D. D. Luckenbill, <i>Ancient Records of Assyria and Babylon</i>, 99-100; J. Reade, &#8220;Studies in Assyrian Geography, Part I: Sennacherib and the Waters of Nineveh,&#8221; <i>RA</i> 72 [1978]: 47-72; idem, &#8220;Studies in Assyrian Geography, Part II: The Northern Canal System,&#8221; <i>RA</i> 72 [1978]: 157-80). According to classical tradition (Diodorus and Xenophon), just before Nineveh fell, a succession of very high rainfalls deluged the area. The Khoser River swelled and the reservoir was breached. The waters rushed through the overloaded canal system, breaking a hole twenty stades (about 2.3 miles or 3.7 km) wide in the city wall and flooding the city. When the waters receded, the Babylonians stormed into Nineveh and conquered the city (Diodorus Siculus, <i>Bibliotheca Historica</i>, 2.26-27, especially 27.1-3; Xenophon, <i>Anabasis</i>, 3.4.12; P. Haupt, &#8220;Xenophon&#8217;s Account of the Fall of Nineveh,&#8221; <i>JAOS</i> 28 [1907]: 65-83). This scenario seems to be corroborated by the archaeological evidence (A. T. Olmstead, <i>History of Assyria</i>, 637).</p>
