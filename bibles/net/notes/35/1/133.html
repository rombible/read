<a name="133"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=33><b>tn</b> The precise meaning of v. 11a is uncertain. The present translation assumes the first line further describes the Babylonian hordes, comparing them to a destructive wind. Another option is to understand <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ruakh</font>) as &#8220;spirit,&#8221; rather than &#8220;wind,&#8221; and take the form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ashem</font>) with what precedes (as suggested by the scribal punctuation). Repointing this form as a geminate verb from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shamam</font>, &#8220;be astonished&#8221;), one could then translate the line, &#8220;The spirit passed on and departed, and I was astonished.&#8221; In this case the line would describe the cessation of the divine revelation which began in v. 5. For a detailed defense of this view, see J. J. M. Roberts, <i>Nahum, Habakkuk, and Zephaniah </i>(OTL), 97-100.</p>
