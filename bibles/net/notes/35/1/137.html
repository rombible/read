<a name="137"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=37><b>tc</b> The MT reads, &#8220;we will not die,&#8221; but an ancient scribal tradition has &#8220;you [i.e., God] will not die.&#8221; This is preferred as a more difficult reading that can explain the rise of the other variant. Later scribes who copied the manuscripts did not want to associate the idea of death with God in any way, so they softened the statement to refer to humanity.</p>
