<A NAME="325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=145><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;ancient ways [or, &#8220;doings&#8221;] are his.&#8221; The meaning of this line is unclear. Traditionally it has been translated, &#8220;his ways are eternal.&#8221; However, in this context (see vv. 3, 7) it is more likely that the line speaks of the <sc>Lord taking the same route as in the days of Moses and Deborah (see Deut 33:2; Judg 5:4). See J. J. M. Roberts, <i>Nahum, Habakkuk, and Zephaniah </i>(OTL), 154.</p>
