<A NAME="39"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=129><b>tn</b> In vv. 3-15 there is a mixture of eleven prefixed verbal forms (without <i>vav</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>] consecutive or with <i>vav</i> conjunctive), sixteen suffixed forms, and three prefixed forms with <i>vav</i> consecutive. All of the forms are best taken as indicating completed action from the speaker&#8217;s standpoint (all of the prefixed forms being regarded as preterites). The forms could be translated with the past tense, but this would be misleading, for this is not a mere recital of God&#8217;s deeds in Israel&#8217;s past history. Habakkuk here describes, in terms reminiscent of past theophanies, his prophetic vision of a future theophany (see v. 7, &#8220;I saw&#8221;). From the prophet&#8217;s visionary standpoint the theophany is &#8220;as good as done.&#8221; This translation uses the English present tense throughout these verses to avoid misunderstanding. A similar strategy is followed by the NEB; in contrast note the NIV and NRSV, which consistently use past tenses throughout the section, and the NASB, which employs present tenses in vv. 3-5 and mostly past tenses in vv. 6-15.</p>
