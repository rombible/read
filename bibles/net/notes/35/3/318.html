<A NAME="318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=138><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and there [is] the covering of his strength&#8221;; or &#8220;and there is his strong covering.&#8221; The meaning of this line is unclear. The point may be that the lightning bolts are merely a covering, or outward display, of God&#8217;s raw power. In Job 36:32 one reads that God &#8220;covers his hands with light [or, &#8220;lightning&#8221;].&#8221;</p>
