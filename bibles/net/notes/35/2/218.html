<A NAME="218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=79><b>sn</b> <i>Sheol</i> is the proper name of the subterranean world which was regarded as the land of the dead. In ancient Canaanite thought Death was a powerful god whose appetite was never satisfied. In the OT Sheol/Death, though not deified, is personified as greedy and as having a voracious appetite. See Prov 30:15-16; Isa 5:14; also see L. I. J. Stadelmann, <i>The Hebrew Conception of the World</i>, 168.</p>
