<A NAME="215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=76><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;loyalty&#8221;; or &#8220;integrity.&#8221; The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">emunah</font>) has traditionally been translated &#8220;faith,&#8221; but the term nowhere else refers to &#8220;belief&#8221; as such. When used of human character and conduct it carries the notion of &#8220;honesty, integrity, reliability, faithfulness.&#8221; The antecedent of the suffix has been understood in different ways. It could refer to God&#8217;s faithfulness, but in this case one would expect a first person suffix (the original form of the LXX has &#8220;my faithfulness&#8221; here). Others understand the &#8220;vision&#8221; to be the antecedent. In this case the reliability of the prophecy is in view. For a statement of this view, see J. J. M. Roberts, <i>Nahum, Habakkuk, and Zephaniah </i>(OTL), 111-12. The present translation assumes that the preceding word &#8220;[the person of] integrity&#8221; is the antecedent. In this case the <sc>Lord is assuring Habakkuk that those who are truly innocent will be preserved through the coming oppression and judgment by their godly lifestyle, for God ultimately rewards this type of conduct. In contrast to these innocent people, those with impure desires (epitomized by the greedy Babylonians; see v. 5) will not be able to withstand God&#8217;s judgment (v. 4a). </p>
