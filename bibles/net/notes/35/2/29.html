<A NAME="29"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=70><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and a witness to the end and it does not lie.&#8221; The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1508;&#1461;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yafeakh</font>) has been traditionally understood as a verb form from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">puakh</font>, &#8220;puff, blow&#8221;; cf. NEB &#8220;it will come in breathless haste&#8221;; NASB &#8220;it hastens toward the goal&#8221;) but recent scholarship has demonstrated that it is actually a noun meaning &#8220;witness&#8221; (cf. NIV &#8220;it speaks of the end / and will not prove false&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;it speaks of the end, and does not lie&#8221;). See J. J. M. Roberts, <i>Nahum, Habakkuk, and Zephaniah </i>(OTL), 106. &#8220;The end&#8221; corresponds to &#8220;the appointed time&#8221; of the preceding line and refers to the time when the prophecy to follow will be fulfilled.</p>
