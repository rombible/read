<A NAME="216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=77><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Indeed wine betrays a proud man and he does not dwell.&#8221; The meaning of the last verb, &#8220;dwell,&#8221; is uncertain. Many take it as a denominative of the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">navah</font>, &#8220;dwelling place&#8221;). In this case it would carry the idea, &#8220;he does not settle down,&#8221; and would picture the drunkard as restless (cf. NIV &#8220;never at rest&#8221;; NASB &#8220;does not stay at home&#8221;). Some relate the verb to an Arabic cognate and translate the phrase as &#8220;he will not succeed, reach his goal.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The Babylonian tyrant is the <i>proud, restless man</i> described in this line as the last line of the verse, with its reference to the conquest of the nations, makes clear. Wine is probably a metaphor for imperialistic success. The more success the Babylonians experience, the more greedy they become just as a drunkard wants more and more wine to satisfy his thirst. But eventually this greed will lead to their downfall, for God will not tolerate such imperialism and will judge the Babylonians appropriately (vv. 6-20).</p>
