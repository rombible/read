The &#8220;appointed time&#8221; refers to the time when the divine judgment anticipated in vv. 6-20 will be realized.</p>
<A NAME="29"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=70><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and a witness to the end and it does not lie.&#8221; The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1508;&#1461;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yafeakh</font>) has been traditionally understood as a verb form from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">puakh</font>, &#8220;puff, blow&#8221;; cf. NEB &#8220;it will come in breathless haste&#8221;; NASB &#8220;it hastens toward the goal&#8221;) but recent scholarship has demonstrated that it is actually a noun meaning &#8220;witness&#8221; (cf. NIV &#8220;it speaks of the end / and will not prove false&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;it speaks of the end, and does not lie&#8221;). See J. J. M. Roberts, <i>Nahum, Habakkuk, and Zephaniah </i>(OTL), 106. &#8220;The end&#8221; corresponds to &#8220;the appointed time&#8221; of the preceding line and refers to the time when the prophecy to follow will be fulfilled.</p>
<A NAME="210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=71><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;it&#8221;; the referent (the message) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="211"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=72><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;If it should delay, wait for it.&#8221; The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1494;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khazon</font>, &#8220;vision, message&#8221;) is the subject of the third person verbs in v. 3 and the antecedent of the pronominal suffix in the phrase &#8220;for it.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=73><b>tn</b> The meaning of this line is unclear, primarily because of the uncertainty surrounding the second word, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">apÿlah</font>). Some read this as an otherwise unattested verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">afal</font>, &#8220;swell&#8221;) from which are derived nouns meaning &#8220;mound&#8221; and &#8220;hemorrhoid.&#8221; This &#8220;swelling&#8221; is then understood in an abstract sense, &#8220;swell with pride.&#8221; This would yield a translation, &#8220;As for the proud, his desires are not right within him&#8221; (cf. NASB &#8220;as for the proud one&#8221;; NIV &#8220;he is puffed up&#8221;; NRSV &#8220;Look at the proud!&#8221;). A multitude of other interpretations of this line, many of which involve emendations of the problematic form, may be found in the commentaries and periodical literature. The present translation assumes an emendation to a Pual form of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1507;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alaf</font>, &#8220;be faint, exhausted&#8221;). (See its use in the Pual in Isa 51:20, and in the Hitpael in Amos 8:13 and Jonah 4:8.) In the antithetical parallelism of the verse, it corresponds to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khayah</font>, &#8220;live&#8221;). The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488; &#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492; &#1504;&#1463;&#1508;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1465; &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lo</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar"> yoshrah nafsho bo</font>), literally, &#8220;not upright his desire within him,&#8221; is taken as a substantival clause that contrasts with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsadiq</font>, &#8220;the righteous one&#8221;) and serves as the subject of the preceding verb. Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nefesh</font>) is understood in the sense of &#8220;desire&#8221; (see BDB 660-61 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> for a list of passages where the word carries this sense).</p>
<A NAME="213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=74><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;righteous.&#8221; The oppressed individuals mentioned in 1:4 are probably in view here.</p>
<A NAME="214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=75><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;will be preserved.&#8221; In the immediate context this probably refers to physical preservation through both the present oppression and the coming judgment (see Hab 3:16-19).</p>
<A NAME="215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=76><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;loyalty&#8221;; or &#8220;integrity.&#8221; The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">emunah</font>) has traditionally been translated &#8220;faith,&#8221; but the term nowhere else refers to &#8220;belief&#8221; as such. When used of human character and conduct it carries the notion of &#8220;honesty, integrity, reliability, faithfulness.&#8221; The antecedent of the suffix has been understood in different ways. It could refer to God&#8217;s faithfulness, but in this case one would expect a first person suffix (the original form of the LXX has &#8220;my faithfulness&#8221; here). Others understand the &#8220;vision&#8221; to be the antecedent. In this case the reliability of the prophecy is in view. For a statement of this view, see J. J. M. Roberts, <i>Nahum, Habakkuk, and Zephaniah </i>(OTL), 111-12. The present translation assumes that the preceding word &#8220;[the person of] integrity&#8221; is the antecedent. In this case the <sc>Lord is assuring Habakkuk that those who are truly innocent will be preserved through the coming oppression and judgment by their godly lifestyle, for God ultimately rewards this type of conduct. In contrast to these innocent people, those with impure desires (epitomized by the greedy Babylonians; see v. 5) will not be able to withstand God&#8217;s judgment (v. 4a). </p>
<A NAME="216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=77><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Indeed wine betrays a proud man and he does not dwell.&#8221; The meaning of the last verb, &#8220;dwell,&#8221; is uncertain. Many take it as a denominative of the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">navah</font>, &#8220;dwelling place&#8221;). In this case it would carry the idea, &#8220;he does not settle down,&#8221; and would picture the drunkard as restless (cf. NIV &#8220;never at rest&#8221;; NASB &#8220;does not stay at home&#8221;). Some relate the verb to an Arabic cognate and translate the phrase as &#8220;he will not succeed, reach his goal.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The Babylonian tyrant is the <i>proud, restless man</i> described in this line as the last line of the verse, with its reference to the conquest of the nations, makes clear. Wine is probably a metaphor for imperialistic success. The more success the Babylonians experience, the more greedy they become just as a drunkard wants more and more wine to satisfy his thirst. But eventually this greed will lead to their downfall, for God will not tolerate such imperialism and will judge the Babylonians appropriately (vv. 6-20).</p>
<A NAME="217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=78><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;who opens wide like Sheol his throat.&#8221; Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nefesh</font>) is understood in a physical sense, meaning &#8220;throat,&#8221; which in turn is figurative for the appetite. See H. W. Wolff, <i>Anthropology of the Old Testament</i>, 11-12.</p>
<A NAME="218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=79><b>sn</b> <i>Sheol</i> is the proper name of the subterranean world which was regarded as the land of the dead. In ancient Canaanite thought Death was a powerful god whose appetite was never satisfied. In the OT Sheol/Death, though not deified, is personified as greedy and as having a voracious appetite. See Prov 30:15-16; Isa 5:14; also see L. I. J. Stadelmann, <i>The Hebrew Conception of the World</i>, 168.</p>

<A NAME="224"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=85><b>tn</b> This question is interjected parenthetically, perhaps to express rhetorically the pain and despair felt by the Babylonians&#8217; victims.</p>
