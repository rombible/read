<a name="119"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=19><b>tc</b> The oldest and most important witnesses to this text, as well as a few others (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>*<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> </font>B 6 1739 sa<sup>ms </sup>bo<sup>pt</sup>), lack the words <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8183; &#952;&#949;&#8183;</font> (<font face="Greektl">tw qew</font>, &#8220;God&#8221;), while the rest have them. An accidental omission could well account for the shorter reading, especially since <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#8183;</font> would have been written as a <i>nomen sacrum</i> (<font face="Greek Uncials">eucaristwtwqMw</font>). However, one might expect to see, in some <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> at least, a dropping of the article but not the divine name. Internally, the Pauline introductory thanksgivings elsewhere always include <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8183; &#952;&#949;&#8183;</font> after <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#8016;&#967;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8182;</font> (<font face="Greektl">eucaristw</font>, &#8220;I thank&#8221;; cf. Rom 1:8; 1 Cor 1:4; Phil 1:3; Phlm 4; in the plural, note Col 1:3; 1 Thess 1:2). However, both the fact that this is already used in 1 Cor 1:4 (thus perhaps motivating scribes to add it ten verses later), and that in later portions of his letters Paul does not consistently use the collocation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#8016;&#967;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8182;</font> with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8183; &#952;&#949;&#8183;</font> (Rom 16:4; 1 Cor 10:30), might give one pause. Still, nowhere else in the <i>corpus Paulinum</i> do we see a sentence begin with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#8016;&#967;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8182; </font>without an accompanying <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8183; &#952;&#949;&#8183;</font>.<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> </font>A decision is difficult, but on balance it is probably best to retain the words.</p>
