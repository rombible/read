<a name="132"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=32><b>sn</b> A quotation from Jer 9:24. The themes of Jer 9 have influenced Paul&#8217;s presentation in vv. 26-31. Jeremiah calls upon the wise, the strong, and the wealthy not to trust in their resources but in their knowledge of the true God &#8211; and so to <i>boast in the Lord</i>. Paul addresses the same three areas of human pride.</p>
