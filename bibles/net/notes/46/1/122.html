<a name="122"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=22><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the scribe.&#8221; The traditional rendering of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#961;&#945;&#956;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">grammateu&quot;</font>) as &#8220;scribe&#8221; does not communicate much to the modern English reader, for whom the term might mean &#8220;professional copyist,&#8221; if it means anything at all. The people referred to here were recognized experts in the law of Moses and in traditional laws and regulations. Thus &#8220;expert in the Mosaic law&#8221; comes closer to the meaning for the modern reader.</p>
