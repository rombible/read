The meaning is not affected in either case, but the reading &#8220;Christ Jesus&#8221; is preferred both because it has somewhat better attestation and because it is slightly more difficult and thus more likely the original (a scribe who found it would be prone to change it to the more common expression). At the same time, Paul is fond of the order &#8220;Christ Jesus.&#8221; As well, the later Pauline letters almost uniformly use this order in the salutations. Thus, on both external and internal grounds, &#8220;Christ Jesus&#8221; is the preferred reading here. </p>
