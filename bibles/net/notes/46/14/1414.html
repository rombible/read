<A NAME="1414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=212><b>sn</b> <i>For they are not permitted to speak. </i>In light of 11:2-16, which gives permission for women to pray or prophesy in the church meetings, the silence commanded here seems not to involve the absolute prohibition of a woman addressing the assembly. Therefore (1) some take <i>be silent</i> to mean not taking an authoritative teaching role as 1 Tim 2 indicates, but (2) the better suggestion is to relate it to the preceding regulations about evaluating the prophets (v. 29). Here Paul would be indicating that the women should not speak up during such an evaluation, since such questioning would be in violation of the submission to male leadership that the OT calls for (<i>the law</i>, e.g., Gen 2:18).</p>
