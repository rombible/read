<A NAME="1413"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=211><b>tn</b> The word for &#8220;woman&#8221; and &#8220;wife&#8221; is the same in Greek. Because of the reference to husbands in v. 35, the word may be translated &#8220;wives&#8221; here. But in passages governing conduct in church meetings like this (cf. 11:2-16; 1 Tim 2:9-15) the general meaning &#8220;women&#8221; is more likely.</p>
