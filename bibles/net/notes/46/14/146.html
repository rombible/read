This conjunction was frequently added by scribes in epistolary literature as a clarifying word, making the connection with the preceding more explicit. As such, it has the earmarks of being a motivated reading and thus should be rejected. NA<sup>27</sup> places the word in brackets, indicating doubts as to its authenticity.</p>
