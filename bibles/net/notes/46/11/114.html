<A NAME="114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=172><b>tc</b> The Byzantine texttype and a few other witnesses (H<sup>c</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936; </font><font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>) essentially duplicate v. 26 at the end of this verse (with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#940;&#961;</font> [<font face="Greektl">gar</font>, &#8220;for&#8221;] in second instead of third position), which itself is a quotation from Ps 24:1 (23:1 LXX). Not only is there a vast number of early, important, and diverse witnesses that lack this extra material (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A B C* D F G H* P 33 81 365 630 1175 1739 1881 2464 latt co), but the quotation seems out of place at this point in the discourse for Paul is here discussing reasons <i>not</i> to partake of food that has been sacrificed to idols. Perhaps scribes felt that since food is from the Lord, to eat meat sacrificed to idols contradicts that belief. Either way, the better witnesses lack the clause which, had it been authentic to v. 28, would have not occasioned such a widespread excision. The evidence is thus compelling for the shorter reading.</p>
