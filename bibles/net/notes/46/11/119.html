<A NAME="119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=177><b>sn</b> Paul does not use a word specifying what type of &#8220;covering&#8221; is meant (veil, hat, etc.). The Greek word he uses here (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#958;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#943;&#945;</font> <font face="Greektl">exousia</font>; translated <i>symbol of authority</i>) could be (1) a figure of speech that may substitute the result (the right to participate in worship) for the appropriate appearance that makes it possible (the covered head). Or (2) it refers to the outward symbol (having the head covered) as representing the inward attitude the woman is to possess (deference to male leadership in the church).</p>
