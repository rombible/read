<A NAME="116"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=174><b>tn</b> Although the Greek word translated &#8220;benefit&#8221; occurs only once in this verse, the Greek article occurs twice. This indicates an implied repetition of the term, which has been included twice in the translation for the sake of clarity and English style.</p>
