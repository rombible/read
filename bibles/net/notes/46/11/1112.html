<A NAME="1112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=180><b>sn</b> No word for veil or head covering occurs in vv. 3-14 (see the note on <i>authority</i> in v. 10). That the hair is regarded by Paul as a <i>covering</i> in v. 15 is not necessarily an argument that the hair is the same as the head covering that he is describing in the earlier verses (esp. v. 10). Throughout this unit of material, Paul points out the <i>similarities</i> of long hair with a head covering. But his doing so seems to suggest that the two are not to be identified with each other. Precisely because they are similar they do not appear to be identical (cf. vv. 5, 6, 7, 10, 13). If head covering = long hair, then what does v. 6 mean (&#8220;For if a woman will not cover her head, she should cut off her hair&#8221;)? This suggests that the covering is not the same as the hair itself.</p>
