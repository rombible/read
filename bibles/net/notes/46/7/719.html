<A NAME="719"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=124><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;virgins.&#8221; There are three main views as to which group of people is referred to by the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#952;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">parqenos</font>) here, and the stance taken here directly impacts one&#8217;s understanding of vv. 36-38. (1) The term could refer to virgin women who were not married. The central issue would then be whether or not their fathers should give them in marriage to eligible men. (This is the view which has been widely held throughout the history of the Church.) (2) A minority understand the term to refer to men and women who are married but who have chosen to live together without sexual relations. This position might have been possible in the Corinthian church, but there is no solid evidence to support it. (3) The view adopted by many modern commentators (see, e.g., Fee, Conzelmann, Barrett) is that the term refers to young, engaged women who were under the influence of various groups within the Corinthian church not to go through with their marriages. The central issue would then be whether the young men and women should continue with their plans and finalize their marriages. For further discussion, see G. D. Fee, <i>First Corinthians</i> (NICNT), 325-28.</p>
