<A NAME="72"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=107><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;each man should have his own wife.&#8221; &#8220;Have&#8221; in this context means &#8220;have marital relations with&#8221; (see the following verse). The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#967;&#941;&#964;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ecetw</font>, &#8220;have&#8221;) occurs twice in the Greek text, but has not been repeated in the translation for stylistic reasons. This verb occurs 8 times in the LXX (Exod 2:1; Deut 28:30; 2 Chr 11:21; 1 Esd 9:12, 18; Tob 3:8; Isa 13:16; 54:1) with the meaning &#8220;have sexual relations with,&#8221; and 9 times elsewhere in the NT with the same meaning (Matt 20:23; 22:28; Mark 6:18; 12:33; Luke 20:28; John 4:18 [twice]; 1 Cor 5:1; 7:29).</p>
