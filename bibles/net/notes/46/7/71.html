<A NAME="71"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=106><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;It is good for a man not to touch a woman,&#8221; a euphemism for sexual relations. This idiom occurs ten times in Greek literature, and all of the references except one appear to refer to sexual relations (cf., e.g., Josephus, <i>Ant</i>. 1.8.1 [1.163]; Gen 20:6 [LXX]; Prov 6:29 [LXX]). For discussion see G. D. Fee, <i>First Corinthians </i>(NICNT), 275. Many recent interpreters believe that here again (as in 6:12-13) Paul cites a slogan the Corinthians apparently used to justify their actions. If this is so, Paul agrees with the slogan in part, but corrects it in the following verses to show how the Corinthians misused the idea to justify abstinence within marriage (cf. 8:1, 4; 10:23). See also G. D. Fee, &#8220;1 Corinthians 7:1 in the NIV,&#8221; <i>JETS</i> 23 (1980): 307-14.</p>
