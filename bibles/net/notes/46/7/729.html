<A NAME="729"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=134><b>sn</b> <i>1 Cor 7:36-38. </i>There are two common approaches to understanding the situation addressed in these verses. One view involves a father or male guardian deciding whether to give his daughter or female ward in marriage (cf. NASB, NIV margin). The evidence for this view is: (1) the phrase in v. 37 (<i>Grk</i>) &#8220;to keep his own virgin&#8221; fits this view well (&#8220;keep his own virgin [in his household]&#8221; rather than give her in marriage), but it does not fit the second view (there is little warrant for adding &#8220;her&#8221; in the way the second view translates it: &#8220;to keep <i>her</i> as a virgin&#8221;). (2) The verb used twice in v. 38 (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#945;&#956;&#943;&#950;&#969;</font>, <font face="Greektl">gamizw</font>) normally means &#8220;to give in marriage&#8221; not &#8220;to get married.&#8221; The latter is usually expressed by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#945;&#956;&#941;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">gamew</font>), as in v. 36b. (3) The father deciding what is best regarding his daughter&#8217;s marriage reflects the more likely cultural situation in ancient Corinth, though it does not fit modern Western customs. While Paul gives his advice in such a situation, he does not command that marriages be arranged in this way universally. If this view is taken, the translation will read as follows: &#8220;<b>7:36</b> If anyone thinks he is acting inappropriately toward his unmarried daughter, if she is past the bloom of youth and it seems necessary, he should do what he wishes; he does not sin. Let them marry. <b>7:37</b> But the man who is firm in his commitment, and is under no necessity but has control over his will, and has decided in his own mind to keep his daughter unmarried, does well. <b>7:38</b> So then the one who gives his daughter in marriage does well, but the one who does not give her does better.&#8221; The other view is taken by NRSV, NIV text, NJB, REB: a single man deciding whether to marry the woman to whom he is engaged. The evidence for this view is: (1) it seems odd to use the word &#8220;virgin&#8221; (vv. 36, 37, 38) if &#8220;daughter&#8221; or &#8220;ward&#8221; is intended. (2) The other view requires some difficult shifting of subjects in v. 36, whereas this view manages a more consistent subject for the various verbs used. (3) The phrases in these verses are used consistently elsewhere in this chapter to describe considerations appropriate to the engaged couple themselves (cf. vv. 9, 28, 39). It seems odd not to change the phrasing in speaking about a father or guardian. If this second view is taken, the translation will read as follows: &#8220;<b>7:36</b> If anyone thinks he is acting inappropriately toward his fiancée, if his passions are too strong and it seems necessary, he should do what he wishes; he does not sin. Let them marry. <b>7:37</b> But the man who is firm in his commitment, and is under no necessity but has control over his will, and has decided in his own mind to keep her as his fiancée, does well. <b>7:38</b> So then, the one who marries his fiancée does well, but the one who does not marry her does better.&#8221;</p>
