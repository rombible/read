<A NAME="725"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=130><b>tc</b> There are three viable variant readings at this point in the text. (1) The reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969; &#947;&#965;&#957;&#8052; &#7969; &#7940;&#947;&#945;&#956;&#959;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7969; &#960;&#945;&#961;&#952;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jh gunh Jh agamo&quot; kai Jh parqeno&quot;</font>, &#8220;the unmarried woman and the virgin&#8221;) is represented by ancient and important <sc>mss, as well as some significant versions (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>15</sup> B 104 365 1505 <i>pc</i> vg co). (2) The reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969; &#947;&#965;&#957;&#8052; &#7969; &#7940;&#947;&#945;&#956;&#959;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7969; &#960;&#945;&#961;&#952;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#7969; &#7940;&#947;&#945;&#956;&#959;&#962;</font> (&#8220;the unmarried woman and the unmarried virgin&#8221;) is also found in ancient and important <sc>mss (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A 33 1739 1881 <i>pc</i>). (3) The reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969; &#947;&#965;&#957;&#8052; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7969; &#960;&#945;&#961;&#952;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#7969; &#7940;&#947;&#945;&#956;&#959;&#962; </font>(&#8220;the woman and the unmarried virgin&#8221;) is found in Western <sc>mss (D F G) and the majority of Byzantine cursives. Based upon external evidence, the first and second readings are the strongest; the readings both reach deep into the second century with strong testimony from <sc>mss of the Alexandrian texttype. Internal evidence seems equally balanced: Scribes may have wanted to add <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969; &#7940;&#947;&#945;&#956;&#959;&#962;</font> to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#952;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font> for stylistic reasons, but they might also have wanted to remove it because it sounded redundant. Because Paul&#8217;s meaning is not quite clear, a decision on the proper textual reading is difficult. On the whole scribes tended to add to the text, not take from it. Thus the first reading should be favored as original, but this decision should be regarded as less than certain.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;The unmarried woman and the virgin.&#8221; The identity of the &#8220;virgin&#8221; here is a matter of interpretation (see note on &#8220;people who have never married&#8221; in v. 25 for discussion), which has in fact contributed to textual variation at this point in the text (see the text critical note above). As far as the translation is concerned, one must determine if one group of women or two are in view. It is possible that Paul means to refer to only one class of women here, namely unmarried virgins, but the use of the adjective <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969; &#7940;&#947;&#945;&#956;&#959;&#962; </font>(<font face="Greektl">Jh agamo&quot;</font>, &#8220;unmarried&#8221;) with &#8220;woman&#8221; and not &#8220;virgin&#8221; precludes that interpretation; in addition, the use of the article with both &#8220;woman&#8221; and &#8220;virgin&#8221; implies that two distinct groups are in view. If two groups are in view, English would more naturally use the conjunction &#8220;or&#8221; to indicate the distinction. Thus the translation &#8220;An unmarried woman or a virgin&#8221; has been used to make clear that two groups are in view.</p>
