<A NAME="1615"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=265><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;the churches of Asia&#8221;; in the NT &#8220;Asia&#8221; always refers to the Roman province of Asia, made up of about one-third of the west and southwest end of modern Asia Minor. Asia lay to the west of the region of Phrygia and Galatia. The words &#8220;the province of&#8221; are supplied to indicate to the modern reader that this does not refer to the continent of Asia.</p>
<A NAME="1616"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=266><b>sn</b> On <i>Aquila and Prisca</i> see also Acts 18:2, 18, 26; Rom 16:3-4; 2 Tim 4:19. In the NT &#8220;Priscilla&#8221; and &#8220;Prisca&#8221; are the same person. The author of Acts uses the full name Priscilla, while Paul uses the diminutive form <i>Prisca</i>.</p>
<A NAME="1617"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=267><b>tc</b> The plural form of this verb, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#963;&#960;&#940;&#950;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">aspazontai</font>, &#8220;[they] greet&#8221;), is found in several good <sc>mss (B F G 075 0121 0243 33 1739 1881) as well as the Byzantine cursives. But the singular is read by an equally impressive group (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> C D K P <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 104 2464 <i>pc</i>). This part of the verse is lacking in codex A. Deciding on the basis of external evidence is quite difficult. Internally, however, the singular appears to have given rise to the plural: (1) The rest of the greetings in this verse are in the plural; this one was probably made plural by some scribes for purposes of assimilation; and, more significantly, (2) since both Aquila and Prisca are mentioned as the ones who send the greeting, the plural is more natural. The singular is, of course, not impossible Greek; indeed, a singular verb with a compound subject is used with some frequency in the NT (cf. Matt 13:55; Mark 8:27; 14:1; John 2:2; 3:22; 4:36, 53; Acts 5:29; 16:31; 1 Tim 6:4). This is especially common when &#8220;Jesus and his disciples&#8221; is the subject. What is significant is that when such a construction is found the emphasis is placed on the first-named person (in this case, Aquila). Normally when these two are mentioned in the NT, Priscilla is mentioned first (Acts 18:18, 26; Rom 16:3; 2 Tim 4:19). Only here and in Acts 18:2 (the first mention of them) is Aquila mentioned before Priscilla. Many suggest that Priscilla is listed first due to prominence. Though that is possible, both the mention of Aquila first here and the singular verb give him special prominence (cf. <i>ExSyn</i> 401-2). What such prominence means in each instance is difficult to assess. Nevertheless, here is a Pauline instance in which Aquila is given prominence. Too much can be made of the word order argument in either direction.</p>
<A NAME="1618"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=268><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;brothers.&#8221; See note on the phrase &#8220;brothers and sisters&#8221; in 1:10.</p>
<A NAME="1619"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=269><b>tn</b> The Greek text has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#945;&#961;&#940;&#957;&#945; &#952;&#940;</font> (<font face="Greektl">marana qa</font>). These Aramaic words can also be read as <font face="Greektl">maran aqa</font>, translated &#8220;Our Lord has come!&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1620"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=270><b>tc</b> Although the majority of <sc>mss (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> </font>A C D<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> &#936; </font>075 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font><font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> </font>lat bo) conclude this letter with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">amhn</font>, &#8220;amen&#8221;), such a conclusion is routinely added by scribes to NT books because a few of these books originally had such an ending (cf. Rom 16:27; Gal 6:18; Jude 25). A majority of Greek witnesses have the concluding <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957; </font>in every NT book except Acts, James, and 3 John (and even in these books, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font> is found in some witnesses). It is thus a predictable variant. Although far fewer witnesses lack the valedictory particle (B F 0121 0243 33 81 630 1739* 1881 sa), their collective testimony is difficult to explain if the omission is not authentic. </p>
