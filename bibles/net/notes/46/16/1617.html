<A NAME="1617"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=267><b>tc</b> The plural form of this verb, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#963;&#960;&#940;&#950;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">aspazontai</font>, &#8220;[they] greet&#8221;), is found in several good <sc>mss (B F G 075 0121 0243 33 1739 1881) as well as the Byzantine cursives. But the singular is read by an equally impressive group (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> C D K P <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 104 2464 <i>pc</i>). This part of the verse is lacking in codex A. Deciding on the basis of external evidence is quite difficult. Internally, however, the singular appears to have given rise to the plural: (1) The rest of the greetings in this verse are in the plural; this one was probably made plural by some scribes for purposes of assimilation; and, more significantly, (2) since both Aquila and Prisca are mentioned as the ones who send the greeting, the plural is more natural. The singular is, of course, not impossible Greek; indeed, a singular verb with a compound subject is used with some frequency in the NT (cf. Matt 13:55; Mark 8:27; 14:1; John 2:2; 3:22; 4:36, 53; Acts 5:29; 16:31; 1 Tim 6:4). This is especially common when &#8220;Jesus and his disciples&#8221; is the subject. What is significant is that when such a construction is found the emphasis is placed on the first-named person (in this case, Aquila). Normally when these two are mentioned in the NT, Priscilla is mentioned first (Acts 18:18, 26; Rom 16:3; 2 Tim 4:19). Only here and in Acts 18:2 (the first mention of them) is Aquila mentioned before Priscilla. Many suggest that Priscilla is listed first due to prominence. Though that is possible, both the mention of Aquila first here and the singular verb give him special prominence (cf. <i>ExSyn</i> 401-2). What such prominence means in each instance is difficult to assess. Nevertheless, here is a Pauline instance in which Aquila is given prominence. Too much can be made of the word order argument in either direction.</p>
