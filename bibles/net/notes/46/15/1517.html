<A NAME="1517"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=233><b>sn</b> Many suggestions have been offered for the puzzling expression <i>baptized for the dead</i>. There are up to 200 different explanations for the passage; a summary is given by K. C. Thompson, &#8220;I Corinthians 15,29 and Baptism for the Dead,&#8221; <i>Studia Evangelica</i> 2.1 (TU 87), 647-59. The most likely interpretation is that some Corinthians had undergone baptism to bear witness to the faith of fellow believers who had died without experiencing that rite themselves. Paul&#8217;s reference to the practice here is neither a recommendation nor a condemnation. He simply uses it as evidence from the lives of the Corinthians themselves to bolster his larger argument, begun in 15:12, that resurrection from the dead is a present reality in Christ and a future reality for them. Whatever they may have proclaimed, the Corinthians&#8217; actions demonstrated that they had hope for a bodily resurrection. </p>
