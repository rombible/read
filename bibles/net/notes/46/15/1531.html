<A NAME="1531"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=247><b>tn</b> The Greek word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8165;&#953;&#960;&#8053;</font> (<font face="Greektl">rJiph</font>) refers to a very rapid movement (BDAG 906 s.v.). This has traditionally been translated as &#8220;twinkling,&#8221; which implies an exceedingly fast &#8211; almost instantaneous &#8211; movement of the eyes, but this could be confusing to the modern reader since twinkling in modern English often suggests a faint, flashing light. In conjunction with the genitive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8000;&#966;&#952;&#945;&#955;&#956;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ofqalmou</font>, &#8220;of an eye&#8221;), &#8220;blinking&#8221; is the best English equivalent (see, e.g., L&amp;N 16.5), although it does not convey the exact speed implicit in the Greek term.</p>
