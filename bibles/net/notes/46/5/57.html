<A NAME="57"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=79><b>tn</b> Verses 4b-5a are capable of various punctuations: (1) &#8220;and I am with you in spirit, through the power of our Lord Jesus turn this man over to Satan&#8221;; (2) &#8220;and I am with you in spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus, turn this man over to Satan&#8221;; (3) &#8220;and I am with you in spirit, along with the power of our Lord Jesus, turn this man over to Satan&#8221; (as adopted in the text). The first option suggests the Lord&#8217;s power is needed when the church is to hand the man over to Satan; the second option suggests that the Lord&#8217;s power is present when Paul is gathered with the Corinthians in spirit; the third option leaves the relation of the Lord&#8217;s power to the surrounding phrases vague, perhaps implying that both are in view.</p>
