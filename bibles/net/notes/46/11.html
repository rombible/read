<A NAME="111"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=169><b>sn</b> &#8220;<i>Everything is lawful.</i>&#8221;<i> </i>Here again Paul cites certain slogans the Corinthians used to justify their behavior (cf. 6:12-13; 7:1; 8:1, 4). Paul agrees with the slogans in part, but corrects them to show how the Corinthians have misused these ideas.</p>
<A NAME="112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=170><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;builds up.&#8221; The object &#8220;others&#8221; is not expressed but is implied, as v. 24 shows. Paul picks up a theme he introduced at the start of this section of the letter (8:1).</p>
<A NAME="113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=171><b>sn</b> A quotation from Ps 24:1; an allusion to Ps 50:12; 89:11.</p>
<A NAME="114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=172><b>tc</b> The Byzantine texttype and a few other witnesses (H<sup>c</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936; </font><font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>) essentially duplicate v. 26 at the end of this verse (with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#940;&#961;</font> [<font face="Greektl">gar</font>, &#8220;for&#8221;] in second instead of third position), which itself is a quotation from Ps 24:1 (23:1 LXX). Not only is there a vast number of early, important, and diverse witnesses that lack this extra material (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A B C* D F G H* P 33 81 365 630 1175 1739 1881 2464 latt co), but the quotation seems out of place at this point in the discourse for Paul is here discussing reasons <i>not</i> to partake of food that has been sacrificed to idols. Perhaps scribes felt that since food is from the Lord, to eat meat sacrificed to idols contradicts that belief. Either way, the better witnesses lack the clause which, had it been authentic to v. 28, would have not occasioned such a widespread excision. The evidence is thus compelling for the shorter reading.</p>
<A NAME="115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=173><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;about that for which&#8221;; the referent (the food) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="116"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=174><b>tn</b> Although the Greek word translated &#8220;benefit&#8221; occurs only once in this verse, the Greek article occurs twice. This indicates an implied repetition of the term, which has been included twice in the translation for the sake of clarity and English style.</p>
<A NAME="117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=175><b>tc</b> The Western and Byzantine texts, as well as one or two Alexandrian <sc>mss (D F G <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936; </font>33 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font><font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> </font>latt sy), combine in reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#959;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">adelfoi</font>, &#8220;brothers&#8221;) here, while the Alexandrian witnesses (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> </font>A B C P 81 630 1175 1739 1881 2464 co) largely lack the address. The addition of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#959;&#943;</font> is apparently a motivated reading, however, for scribes would have naturally wanted to add it to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#960;&#945;&#953;&#957;&#8182; &#948;&#8050; &#8017;&#956;&#8118;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">epainw de Juma&quot;</font>, &#8220;now I praise you&#8221;), especially as this begins a new section. On the other hand, it is difficult to explain how the shorter reading could have arisen from the longer one. Thus, on both internal and external grounds, the shorter reading is strongly preferred. </p>
<A NAME="118"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=176><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the husband is the head of his wife.&#8221; The same Greek words translated &#8220;man&#8221; and &#8220;woman&#8221; can mean, as determined by context, &#8220;husband&#8221; and &#8220;wife&#8221; respectively. Such an approach is followed by NAB, TEV, NRSV, and NLT (with some variations).</p>
<A NAME="119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=177><b>sn</b> Paul does not use a word specifying what type of &#8220;covering&#8221; is meant (veil, hat, etc.). The Greek word he uses here (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#958;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#943;&#945;</font> <font face="Greektl">exousia</font>; translated <i>symbol of authority</i>) could be (1) a figure of speech that may substitute the result (the right to participate in worship) for the appropriate appearance that makes it possible (the covered head). Or (2) it refers to the outward symbol (having the head covered) as representing the inward attitude the woman is to possess (deference to male leadership in the church).</p>
<A NAME="1110"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=178><b>sn</b> Paul does not explain this reference to <i>the angels</i>, and its point is not entirely clear. It seems to reflect an awareness that angels are witnesses to church life (cf. Eph 3:10) and would be particularly sensitive to resistance against God&#8217;s created order.</p>
<A NAME="1111"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=179><b>sn</b> Paul does not mean <i>nature</i> in the sense of &#8220;the natural world&#8221; or &#8220;Mother Nature.&#8221; It denotes &#8220;the way things are&#8221; because of God&#8217;s design.</p>
<A NAME="1112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=180><b>sn</b> No word for veil or head covering occurs in vv. 3-14 (see the note on <i>authority</i> in v. 10). That the hair is regarded by Paul as a <i>covering</i> in v. 15 is not necessarily an argument that the hair is the same as the head covering that he is describing in the earlier verses (esp. v. 10). Throughout this unit of material, Paul points out the <i>similarities</i> of long hair with a head covering. But his doing so seems to suggest that the two are not to be identified with each other. Precisely because they are similar they do not appear to be identical (cf. vv. 5, 6, 7, 10, 13). If head covering = long hair, then what does v. 6 mean (&#8220;For if a woman will not cover her head, she should cut off her hair&#8221;)? This suggests that the covering is not the same as the hair itself.</p>
<A NAME="1113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=181><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;those approved may be evident among you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=182><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;first&#8221; is not in the Greek text, but is implied. It has been supplied in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1115"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=183><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;in this manner.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1116"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=184><b>tn</b> The word more literally means, &#8220;judging between, recognizing, distinguishing.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=185><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;are asleep.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#959;&#953;&#956;&#940;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">koimaw</font>) literally means &#8220;sleep,&#8221; but it is often used in the Bible as a euphemism for the death of a believer.</p>
<A NAME="1118"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=186><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;brothers.&#8221; See note on the phrase &#8220;brothers and sisters&#8221; in 1:10.</p>
