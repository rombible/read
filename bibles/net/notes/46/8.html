<A NAME="81"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=136><b>sn</b> &#8220;<i>We all have knowledge.</i>&#8221;<i> </i>Here and in v. 4 Paul cites certain slogans the Corinthians apparently used to justify their behavior (cf. 6:12-13; 7:1; 10:23). Paul agrees with the slogans in part, but corrects them to show how the Corinthians have misused these ideas.</p>
<A NAME="82"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=137><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;this one.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="83"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=138><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;him&#8221;; in the translation the most likely referent (God) has been specified for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="84"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=139><b>sn</b> &#8220;<i>An idol in this world is nothing</i>&#8221;<i> </i>and &#8220;<i>There is no God but one.</i>&#8221;<i> </i>Here and in v. 1 Paul cites certain slogans the Corinthians apparently used to justify their behavior (cf. 6:12-13; 7:1; 10:23). Paul agrees with the slogans in part, but corrects them to show how the Corinthians have misused these ideas.</p>
<A NAME="85"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=140><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;through whom [are] all things and we [are] through him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="86"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=141><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;built up&#8221;; This is the same word used in v. 1b. It is used ironically here: The weak person is &#8220;built up&#8221; to commit what he regards as sin.</p>
<A NAME="87"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=142><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the one who is weak&#8230;the brother for whom Christ died,&#8221; but see note on the word &#8220;Christian&#8221; in 5:11.</p>
<A NAME="88"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=143><b>tn</b> This may be an indirect middle, &#8220;destroys himself.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="89"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=144><b>tn</b> See note on the phrase &#8220;brothers and sisters&#8221; in 1:10.</p>
<A NAME="810"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=145><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;my brother.&#8221; Both &#8220;my brother or sister&#8221; earlier in the verse and &#8220;one of them&#8221; here translate the same Greek phrase. Since the same expression occurs in the previous line, a pronoun phrase is substituted here to suit English style, which is less tolerant of such repetition.</p>
