<A NAME="611"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=98><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;both this [stomach] and these [foods].&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> There is debate as to the extent of the Corinthian slogan which Paul quotes here. Some argue that the slogan is only the first sentence &#8211; &#8220;Food is for the stomach and the stomach is for food&#8221; &#8211; with the second statement forming Paul&#8217;s rejoinder, while others argue that the slogan contains both sentences (as in the translation above). The argument which favors the latter is the tight conceptual and grammatical parallelism which occurs if Paul&#8217;s response begins with &#8220;The body is not for sexual immorality&#8221; and then continues through the end of v. 14. For discussion and diagrams of this structure, see G. D. Fee, <i>First Corinthians</i> (NICNT), 253-57.</p>
