<A NAME="65"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=92><b>tn</b> This term is sometimes rendered &#8220;effeminate,&#8221; although in contemporary English usage such a translation could be taken to refer to demeanor rather than behavior. BDAG 613 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#945;&#955;&#945;&#954;&#972;&#962;</font> 2 has &#8220;pert. to being passive in a same-sex relationship, <i>effeminate</i> esp. of <i>catamites</i>, of men and boys who are sodomized by other males in such a relationship.&#8221; L&amp;N 88.281 states, &#8220;the passive male partner in homosexual intercourse &#8211; &#8216;homosexual.&#8217; &#8230;As in Greek, a number of other languages also have entirely distinct terms for the active and passive roles in homosexual intercourse.&#8221; See also the discussion in G. D. Fee, <i>First Corinthians</i> (NICNT), 243-44. A number of modern translations have adopted the phrase &#8220;male prostitutes&#8221; for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#945;&#955;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#943;</font> in 1 Cor 6:9 (NIV, NRSV, NLT) but this could be misunderstood by the modern reader to mean &#8220;males who sell their services to women,&#8221; while the term in question appears, at least in context, to relate to homosexual activity between males. Furthermore, it is far from certain that prostitution as commonly understood (the selling of sexual favors) is specified here, as opposed to a consensual relationship. Thus the translation &#8220;passive homosexual partners&#8221; has been used here.</p>
