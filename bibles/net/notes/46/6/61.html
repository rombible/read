<A NAME="61"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=88><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;if you have ordinary lawsuits, appoint as judges those who have no standing in the church!&#8221; This alternative reading (cf. KJV, NIV) takes the Greek verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#952;&#943;&#950;&#949;&#964;&#949;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kaqizete</font>) as an ironic imperative instead of a question. This verb comes, however, at the end of the sentence. It is not impossible that Paul meant for it to be understood this way, but its placement in the sentence does not make this probable.</p>
