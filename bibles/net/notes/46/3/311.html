<A NAME="311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=55><b>tn</b> Although 1 Cor 3:9 is frequently understood to mean, &#8220;we are coworkers <i>with</i> God,&#8221; such a view assumes that the genitive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">qeou</font>) is associative because of its relationship to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#965;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#947;&#959;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">sunergoi</font>). However, not only is a genitive of association not required by the syntax (cf. <i>ExSyn</i> 130), but the context is decidedly against it: Paul and Apollos are insignificant compared to the God whom they serve (vv. 5-8).</p>
