<A NAME="103"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=157><b>tc</b> &#8225; A number of witnesses, some of them important, have the passive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#946;&#945;&#960;&#964;&#943;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#945;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ebaptisqhsan</font>, &#8220;were baptized&#8221;) instead of the middle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#946;&#945;&#960;&#964;&#943;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#959;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ebaptisanto</font>, &#8220;baptized [themselves]&#8221;) in v. 2 (so <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A C D F G <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 33 <i>al</i> latt). However, the middle is not without its representation (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46c</sup> B 1739 1881 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> Or; the original hand of <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46</sup> read the imperfect middle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#946;&#945;&#960;&#964;&#943;&#950;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#959; </font>[<font face="Greektl">ebaptizonto</font>]). The passive looks like a motivated reading in that it is clearer and conforms to typical Pauline usage (his thirteen instances of the verb are all either active or passive). B. M. Metzger, in representing a minority opinion of the UBS Committee, suggests that the middle would have been appropriate for Jewish baptism in which the convert baptizes himself (<i>TCGNT</i> 493). But this assumes that the middle is a <i>direct</i> middle, a rare occurrence in the NT (and never elsewhere with this verb). Further, it is not really baptism that is in view in v. 2, but passing through the Red Sea (thus, a metaphorical use). Although the present editors agree with the minority&#8217;s resultant reading, it is better to take the middle as causative/permissive and the scribes as changing it to a passive for clarity&#8217;s sake. Translational differences are minimal, though some exegetical implications are involved (see <i>ExSyn</i> 427). </p>
