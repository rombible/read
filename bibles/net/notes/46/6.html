<A NAME="61"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=88><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;if you have ordinary lawsuits, appoint as judges those who have no standing in the church!&#8221; This alternative reading (cf. KJV, NIV) takes the Greek verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#952;&#943;&#950;&#949;&#964;&#949;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kaqizete</font>) as an ironic imperative instead of a question. This verb comes, however, at the end of the sentence. It is not impossible that Paul meant for it to be understood this way, but its placement in the sentence does not make this probable.</p>
<A NAME="62"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=89><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;to decide between his brother (and his opponent),&#8221; but see the note on the word &#8220;Christian&#8221; in 5:11.</p>
<A NAME="63"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=90><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;does a brother sue a brother,&#8221; but see the note on the word &#8220;Christian&#8221; in 5:11.</p>
<A NAME="64"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=91><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;brothers.&#8221; The Greek term &#8220;brother&#8221; literally refers to family relationships, but here it is used in a broader sense to connote familial relationships within the family of God (cf. BDAG 18 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#972;&#962;</font> 2.a). See also the note on the phrase &#8220;brothers and sisters&#8221; in 1:10.</p>
<A NAME="65"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=92><b>tn</b> This term is sometimes rendered &#8220;effeminate,&#8221; although in contemporary English usage such a translation could be taken to refer to demeanor rather than behavior. BDAG 613 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#945;&#955;&#945;&#954;&#972;&#962;</font> 2 has &#8220;pert. to being passive in a same-sex relationship, <i>effeminate</i> esp. of <i>catamites</i>, of men and boys who are sodomized by other males in such a relationship.&#8221; L&amp;N 88.281 states, &#8220;the passive male partner in homosexual intercourse &#8211; &#8216;homosexual.&#8217; &#8230;As in Greek, a number of other languages also have entirely distinct terms for the active and passive roles in homosexual intercourse.&#8221; See also the discussion in G. D. Fee, <i>First Corinthians</i> (NICNT), 243-44. A number of modern translations have adopted the phrase &#8220;male prostitutes&#8221; for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#945;&#955;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#943;</font> in 1 Cor 6:9 (NIV, NRSV, NLT) but this could be misunderstood by the modern reader to mean &#8220;males who sell their services to women,&#8221; while the term in question appears, at least in context, to relate to homosexual activity between males. Furthermore, it is far from certain that prostitution as commonly understood (the selling of sexual favors) is specified here, as opposed to a consensual relationship. Thus the translation &#8220;passive homosexual partners&#8221; has been used here.</p>
<A NAME="66"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=93><b>tn</b> On this term BDAG 135 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#961;&#963;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#954;&#959;&#943;&#964;&#951;&#962;</font> states, &#8220;a male who engages in sexual activity w. a pers. of his own sex, <i>pederast </i>1 Cor 6:9&#8230;of one who assumes the dominant role in same-sex activity, opp. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#945;&#955;&#945;&#954;&#972;&#962;</font>&#8230;1 Ti 1:10; Pol 5:3. Cp. Ro 1:27.&#8221; L&amp;N 88.280 states, &#8220;a male partner in homosexual intercourse &#8211; &#8216;homosexual.&#8217;&#8230;It is possible that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#961;&#963;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#954;&#959;&#943;&#964;&#951;&#962;</font> in certain contexts refers to the active male partner in homosexual intercourse in contrast with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#945;&#955;&#945;&#954;&#972;&#962;</font>, the passive male partner.&#8221; Since there is a distinction in contemporary usage between sexual orientation and actual behavior, the qualification &#8220;practicing&#8221; was supplied in the translation, following the emphasis in BDAG.</p>
<A NAME="67"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=94><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;revilers&#8221;; BDAG 602 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#959;&#943;&#948;&#959;&#961;&#959;&#962;</font> defines the term as &#8220;<i>reviler, abusive person</i>.&#8221; Because the term &#8220;abusive&#8221; without further qualification has become associated in contemporary English with both physical and sexual abuse, the qualifier &#8220;verbally&#8221; has been supplied in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="68"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=95><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;and some [of you] were these.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="69"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=96><b>tc</b> The external evidence in support of the reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Ihsou Cristou</font>, &#8220;Jesus Christ&#8221;) is quite impressive: <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>11vid,46</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> </font>B C<sup>vid</sup> D* P 33 81 104 365 629 630 1739 1881 2464 <i>al </i>lat bo as well as several fathers, while the reading with merely <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;</font> has significantly poorer support (A D<sup>2</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font><font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> </font>sa). Although the wording of the original could certainly have been expanded, it is also possible that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</font> as a <i>nomen sacrum</i> could have accidentally dropped out. Although the latter is not as likely under normal circumstances, in light of the early and widespread witnesses for the fuller expression, the original wording seems to have been <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</font>.</p>
<A NAME="610"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=97><b>sn</b> <i>All things are lawful for me. </i>In the expressions in vv. 12-13 within quotation marks, Paul cites certain slogans the Corinthians apparently used to justify their behavior. Paul agrees with the slogans in part, but corrects them to show how the Corinthians have misused these ideas.</p>
<A NAME="611"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=98><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;both this [stomach] and these [foods].&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> There is debate as to the extent of the Corinthian slogan which Paul quotes here. Some argue that the slogan is only the first sentence &#8211; &#8220;Food is for the stomach and the stomach is for food&#8221; &#8211; with the second statement forming Paul&#8217;s rejoinder, while others argue that the slogan contains both sentences (as in the translation above). The argument which favors the latter is the tight conceptual and grammatical parallelism which occurs if Paul&#8217;s response begins with &#8220;The body is not for sexual immorality&#8221; and then continues through the end of v. 14. For discussion and diagrams of this structure, see G. D. Fee, <i>First Corinthians</i> (NICNT), 253-57.</p>
<A NAME="612"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=99><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;is in relationship with.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="613"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=100><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;is one body,&#8221; implying the association &#8220;with her.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="614"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=101><b>sn</b> A quotation from Gen 2:24.</p>
<A NAME="615"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=102><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;in relationship with.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="616"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=103><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;is one spirit,&#8221; implying the association &#8220;with him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="617"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=104><b>sn</b> It is debated whether this is a Corinthian slogan. If it is not, then Paul is essentially arguing that there are two types of sin, nonsexual sins which take place outside the body and sexual sins which are against a person&#8217;s very own body. If it is a Corinthian slogan, then it is a slogan used by the Corinthians to justify their immoral behavior. With it they are claiming that anything done in the body or through the body had no moral relevance. A decision here is very difficult, but the latter is to be preferred for two main reasons. (1) This is the most natural understanding of the statement as it is written. To construe it as a statement by Paul requires a substantial clarification in the sense (e.g., &#8220;All <i>other </i>sins&#8230;&#8221; [NIV]). (2) Theologically the former is more difficult: Why would Paul single out sexual sins as more intrinsically related to the body than other sins, such as gluttony or drunkenness? For these reasons, it is more likely that the phrase in quotation marks is indeed a Corinthian slogan which Paul turns against them in the course of his argument, although the decision must be regarded as tentative.</p>
<A NAME="618"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=105><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the &#8216;in you&#8217; Holy Spirit.&#8221; The position of the prepositional phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#8017;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">en Jumin</font>, &#8220;in you&#8221;) between the article and the adjective effectively places the prepositional phrase in first attributive position. Such constructions are generally translated into English as relative clauses.</p>
