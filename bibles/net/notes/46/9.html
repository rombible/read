It is supported by <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* B D*<sup>,c</sup> 33 1739 1881 as well as early patristic authors.

Not only is the harder reading in keeping with Pauline style, but it is also found in the earlier and better witnesses.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Paul breaks off his thought at mid-sentence (indicated by the dash in the translation) and it is somewhat difficult to determine his <i>reason for boasting</i>. Most likely Paul would rather die than be deprived of the boast that he had offered the gospel free of charge even though as an apostle he had the right to such support (9:14). Did he say this as a way of criticizing his opponents? Perhaps only indirectly. His focus has more to do with not hindering the gospel than what his opponents were doing (9:12). </p>
<A NAME="98"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=153><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;more converts.&#8221; The word &#8220;people&#8221; is not in the Greek text, but is implied. It has been supplied in the translation to clarify the meaning.</p>
<A NAME="99"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=154><b>tc</b> The Byzantine text, as well as a few other witnesses (D<sup>2</sup> [L] <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936; </font>1881 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>) lack this parenthetical material, while geographically widespread, early, and diverse witnesses have the words (so <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> </font>A B C D* F G P 33 104 365 1175 1505 1739 <i>al </i>latt). The phrase may have dropped out accidentally through homoioteleuton (note that both the preceding phrase and the parenthesis end in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8017;&#960;&#8056; &#957;&#972;&#956;&#959;&#957;</font> [<font face="Greektl">Jupo nomon</font>, &#8220;under the law&#8221;]), or intentionally by overscrupulous scribes who felt that the statement &#8220;I myself am not under the law&#8221; could have led to license.</p>
