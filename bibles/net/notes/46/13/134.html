<A NAME="134"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=198><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;we are seeing through [= using] a mirror by means of a dark image.&#8221; Corinth was well known in the ancient world for producing some of the finest bronze mirrors available. Paul&#8217;s point in this analogy, then, is not that our current understanding and relationship with God is distorted (as if the mirror reflected poorly), but rather that it is &#8220;indirect,&#8221; (i.e., the nature of looking in a mirror) compared to the relationship we will enjoy with him in the future when we see him &#8220;face to face&#8221; (cf. G. D. Fee, <i>First Corinthians</i> [NICNT], 648). The word &#8220;indirectly&#8221; translates the Greek phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#945;&#7984;&#957;&#943;&#947;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953; </font>(<font face="Greektl">ejn ainigmati</font>, &#8220;in an obscure image&#8221;) which itself may reflect an allusion to Num 12:8 (LXX <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8016; &#948;&#953;&#8127; &#945;&#7984;&#957;&#953;&#947;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957;</font>), where God says that he speaks to Moses &#8220;mouth to mouth [= face to face]&#8230;and not in dark figures [of speech].&#8221; Though this allusion to the OT is not explicitly developed here, it probably did not go unnoticed by the Corinthians who were apparently familiar with OT traditions about Moses (cf. 1 Cor 10:2). Indeed, in 2 Cor 3:13-18 Paul had recourse with the Corinthians to contrast Moses&#8217; ministry under the old covenant with the hope afforded through apostolic ministry and the new covenant. Further, it is in this context, specifically in 2 Cor 3:18, that the apostle invokes the use of the mirror analogy again in order to unfold the nature of the Christian&#8217;s progressive transformation by the Spirit.</p>
