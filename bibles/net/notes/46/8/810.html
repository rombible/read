<A NAME="810"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=145><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;my brother.&#8221; Both &#8220;my brother or sister&#8221; earlier in the verse and &#8220;one of them&#8221; here translate the same Greek phrase. Since the same expression occurs in the previous line, a pronoun phrase is substituted here to suit English style, which is less tolerant of such repetition.</p>
