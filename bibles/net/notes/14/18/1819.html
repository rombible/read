<A NAME="1819"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=532><b>sn</b> One does not expect Micaiah, having just vowed to speak only what the <sc>Lord tells him, to agree with the other prophets and give the king an inaccurate prophecy. Micaiah&#8217;s actions became understandable later, when we discover that the <sc>Lord desires to deceive the king and lead him to his demise. The <sc>Lord even dispatches a lying spirit to deceive Ahab&#8217;s prophets. Micaiah can lie to the king because he realizes this lie is from the <sc>Lord. It is important to note that in v. 13 Micaiah only vows to speak the word of his God; he does not necessarily say he will tell the truth. In this case the <sc>Lord&#8217;s word is deliberately deceptive. Only when the king adjures him to tell the truth (v. 15), does Micaiah do so. </p>
