<A NAME="1825"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=538><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has two imperfects connected by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1490;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿgam</font>). These verbs could be translated as specific futures, &#8220;you will deceive and also you will prevail,&#8221; in which case the <sc>Lord is assuring the spirit of success on his mission. However, in a commissioning context (note the following imperatives) such as this, it is more likely that the imperfects are injunctive, in which case one could translate, &#8220;Deceive, and also overpower.&#8221;</p>
