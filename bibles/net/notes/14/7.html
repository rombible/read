<A NAME="76"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=214><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text omits reference to the grain offerings at this point, but note that they are included both in the list in the second half of the verse (see note on &#8220;offerings&#8221; at the end of this verse) and in the parallel account in 1 Kgs 8:64. The construction <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1504;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et-hamminkhah</font>; <i>vav</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>] + accusative sign + noun with article; &#8220;grain offerings&#8221;) was probably omitted accidentally by homoioarcton. Note the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et</font>) that immediately follows.</p>
<A NAME="77"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=215><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to hold the burnt sacrifices, grain offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.&#8221; Because this is redundant, the translation employs a summary phrase: &#8220;all these offerings.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="78"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=216><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Solomon held the festival at that time for seven days, and all Israel was with him, a very great assembly from Lebo Hamath to the wadi of Egypt.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="714"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=222><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;temple of sacrifice.&#8221; This means the <sc>Lord designated the temple as the place for making sacrifices, and this has been clarified in the translation.</p>

<A NAME="717"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=225><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the land,&#8221; which stands here by metonymy for the vegetation growing in it.</p>
<A NAME="718"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=226><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;over whom my name is called.&#8221; The Hebrew idiom &#8220;call the name over&#8221; indicates ownership. See 2 Sam 12:28.</p>
<A NAME="719"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=227><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;seek my face,&#8221; where &#8220;my face&#8221; is figurative for God&#8217;s presence and acceptance.</p>
<A NAME="720"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=228><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and turn from their sinful ways.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="721"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=229><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;hear.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="722"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=230><b>sn</b> Here the phrase <i>heal their land</i> means restore the damage done by the drought, locusts and plague mentioned in v. 13.</p>
<A NAME="723"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=231><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my eyes will be open and my ears attentive to the prayer of this place.&#8221; Note Solomon&#8217;s request in 6:40.</p>
<A NAME="724"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=232><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for my name to be there perpetually [or perhaps, &#8220;forever&#8221;].&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="725"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=233><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and my eyes and my heart will be there all the days.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="726"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=234><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;As for you, if you walk before me, as David your father walked, by doing all which I commanded you, [and] you keep my rules and my regulations.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Verse 17 is actually a lengthy protasis (&#8220;if&#8221; section) of a conditional sentence, the apodosis (&#8220;then&#8221; section) of which appears in v. 18.</p>
<A NAME="727"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=235><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will establish the throne of your kingdom.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="728"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=236><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;there will not be cut off from you a man ruling over Israel.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="729"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=237><b>tn</b> The Hebrew pronoun is plural, suggesting that Solomon and all Israel (or perhaps Solomon and his successors) are in view. To convey this to the English reader, the translation &#8220;you people&#8221; has been employed.</p>
<A NAME="730"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=238><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;which I placed before you.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="731"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=239><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and walk and serve other gods and bow down to them.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="732"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=240><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;them.&#8221; The switch from the second to the third person pronoun is rhetorically effective, for it mirrors God&#8217;s rejection of his people &#8211; he has stopped addressing them as &#8220;you&#8221; and begun addressing them as &#8220;them.&#8221; However, the switch is awkward and confusing in English, so the translation maintains the direct address style.</p>
<A NAME="733"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=241><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;them.&#8221; See the note on &#8220;you&#8221; earlier in this verse.</p>
<A NAME="734"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=242><b>tc</b> Instead of &#8220;I will throw away,&#8221; the parallel text in 1 Kgs 9:7 has &#8220;I will send away.&#8221; The two verbs sound very similar in Hebrew, so the discrepancy is likely due to an oral transmissional error.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and this temple which I consecrated for my name I will throw away from before my face.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="735"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=243><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;him,&#8221; which appears in context to refer to Israel (i.e., &#8220;you&#8221; in direct address). Many translations understand the direct object of the verb &#8220;make&#8221; to be the temple (NEB, NASB, NIV, NRSV &#8220;it&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="736"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=244><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and I will make him [i.e., Israel] a proverb and a taunt,&#8221; that is, a proverbial example of destruction and an object of reproach. </p>
<A NAME="737"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=245><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and this house which was high/elevated.&#8221; The statement makes little sense in this context, which predicts the desolation that judgment will bring. Some treat the clause as concessive, &#8220;Even though this temple is lofty [now].&#8221; Others, following the lead of several ancient versions, emend the text to, &#8220;this temple will become a heap of ruins.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="738"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=246><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they will say.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="739"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=247><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fathers.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="740"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=248><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they took hold of other gods and bowed down to them and served them.&#8221;</p>
