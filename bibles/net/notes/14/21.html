<A NAME="212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=629><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fathers&#8221; (also in vv. 10, 12, 19).</p>
<A NAME="213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=630><b>sn</b> The phrase <i>the City of David</i> refers here to the fortress of Zion in Jerusalem, not to Bethlehem. See 2 Sam 5:7.</p>
<A NAME="214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=631><b>tn</b> The parallel account in 2 Kgs 8:16-24 has the variant spelling &#8220;Jehoram.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=632><b>sn</b> A number of times in 2 Chronicles &#8220;Israel&#8221; is used instead of the more specific &#8220;Judah&#8221;; see 2 Chr 12:6; 23:2). In the interest of consistency some translations (e.g., NAB, NRSV) substitute &#8220;Judah&#8221; for &#8220;Israel&#8221; here.</p>
<A NAME="216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=633><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Jehoram arose over the kingdom of his father and strengthened himself.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=636><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab did, for the daughter of Ahab was his wife.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2110"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=637><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the eyes of.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="2112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=639><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;covenant.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="2113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=640><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;which he made to David, just as he had promised to give him and his sons a lamp all the days.&#8221; Here &#8220;lamp&#8221; is metaphorical, symbolizing the Davidic dynasty.</p>
<A NAME="2114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=641><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;his&#8221;; the referent (Jehoram) has been specified in the translation for clarity and for stylistic reasons.</p>

<A NAME="2116"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=643><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he arose at night and defeated Edom, who had surrounded him, and the chariot officers.&#8221; The Hebrew text as it stands gives the impression that Jehoram was surrounded and launched a victorious nighttime counterattack. Yet v. 10 goes on to state that the Edomite revolt was successful. The translation above assumes an emendation of the Hebrew text. Adding a third masculine singular pronominal suffix to the accusative sign before Edom (reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1465;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">oto</font>, &#8220;him&#8221;] instead of just <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et</font>]) and taking Edom as the subject of verbs allows one to translate the verse in a way that is more consistent with the context, which depicts an Israelite defeat, not victory. See also 2 Kgs 8:21. </p>
<A NAME="2117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=644><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Edom rebelled from under the hand of Judah until this day.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="2119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=646><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he.&#8221; This pronoun could refer to Judah, but the context focuses on Jehoram&#8217;s misdeeds. See especially v. 11.</p>
<A NAME="2120"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=647><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he caused the residents of Jerusalem to commit adultery.&#8221; In this context spiritual unfaithfulness to the <sc>Lord is in view rather than physical adultery.</p>

Because of its length and complexity (and the tendency of contemporary English to use shorter sentences), the translation has divided it up into several English sentences.</p>
