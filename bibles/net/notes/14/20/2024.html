<A NAME="2024"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=591><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all Judah.&#8221; The words &#8220;you people of&#8221; are supplied in the translation for clarity. The Hebrew text uses the name &#8220;Judah&#8221; by metonymy for the people of Judah. Unlike the previous instance in v. 13 where infants, wives, and children are mentioned separately, this reference appears to include them all.</p>
