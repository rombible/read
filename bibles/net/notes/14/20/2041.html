<A NAME="2041"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=608><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they helped, each one his fellow, for destruction.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1494;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">azar</font>), traditionally understood as the well-attested verb meaning &#8220;to help,&#8221; is an odd fit in this context. It is possible that it is from a homonymic root, perhaps meaning to &#8220;attack.&#8221; This root is attested in Ugaritic in a nominal form meaning &#8220;young man, warrior, hero.&#8221; For a discussion of the proposed root, see <i>HALOT</i> 811 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1494;&#1512;</font>. </p>
