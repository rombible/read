<A NAME="737"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=245><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and this house which was high/elevated.&#8221; The statement makes little sense in this context, which predicts the desolation that judgment will bring. Some treat the clause as concessive, &#8220;Even though this temple is lofty [now].&#8221; Others, following the lead of several ancient versions, emend the text to, &#8220;this temple will become a heap of ruins.&#8221; </p>
