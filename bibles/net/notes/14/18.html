<A NAME="187"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=520><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="188"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=521><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the word of the <sc>Lord.&#8221; Jehoshaphat is requesting a prophetic oracle revealing the Lord&#8217;s will in the matter and their prospects for success. For examples of such oracles, see 2 Sam 5:19, 23-24.</p>
<A NAME="189"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=522><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Should we go against Ramoth Gilead for war or should I refrain?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1810"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=523><b>tn</b> Though Jehoshaphat had requested an oracle from &#8220;the <sc>Lord&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yÿhvah</font>, &#8220;Yahweh&#8221;), the Israelite prophets stop short of actually using this name and substitute the title <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elohim</font>, &#8220;the God&#8221;). This ambiguity may explain in part Jehoshaphat&#8217;s hesitancy and caution (vv. 7-8). He seems to doubt that the 400 are genuine prophets of the <sc>Lord.</p>
<A NAME="1811"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=524><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to seek the <sc>Lord from him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1812"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=525><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;hate.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1813"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=526><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all his days.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1814"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=527><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;his name is&#8221; are supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="1815"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=528><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;at,&#8221; which in this case probably means &#8220;near.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1816"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=529><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the words of the prophets are [with] one mouth good for the king.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1817"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=530><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;let your words be like one of them and speak good.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1818"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=531><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Micaiah) has been specified in the translation both for clarity and for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="1819"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=532><b>sn</b> One does not expect Micaiah, having just vowed to speak only what the <sc>Lord tells him, to agree with the other prophets and give the king an inaccurate prophecy. Micaiah&#8217;s actions became understandable later, when we discover that the <sc>Lord desires to deceive the king and lead him to his demise. The <sc>Lord even dispatches a lying spirit to deceive Ahab&#8217;s prophets. Micaiah can lie to the king because he realizes this lie is from the <sc>Lord. It is important to note that in v. 13 Micaiah only vows to speak the word of his God; he does not necessarily say he will tell the truth. In this case the <sc>Lord&#8217;s word is deliberately deceptive. Only when the king adjures him to tell the truth (v. 15), does Micaiah do so. </p>
<A NAME="1820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=533><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;swear an oath by.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1821"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=534><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Micaiah) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1822"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=535><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Micaiah) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1823"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=536><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the spirit.&#8221; The significance of the article prefixed to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ruakh</font>) is uncertain, but it could contain a clue as to this spirit&#8217;s identity, especially when interpreted in light of verse 23. It is certainly possible, and probably even likely, that the article is used in a generic or dramatic sense and should be translated, &#8220;a spirit.&#8221; In the latter case it would show that this spirit was vivid and definite in the mind of Micaiah the storyteller. However, if one insists that the article indicates a well-known or universally known spirit, the following context provides a likely referent. Verse 23 tells how Zedekiah slapped Micaiah in the face and then asked sarcastically, &#8220;Which way did the spirit from the <sc>Lord (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;&#1470;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ruakh-yÿhvah</font>) go when he went from me to speak to you?&#8221; When the phrase &#8220;the spirit of the <sc>Lord&#8221; refers to the divine spirit (rather than the divine breath or mind, as in Isa 40:7, 13) elsewhere, the spirit energizes an individual or group for special tasks or moves one to prophesy. This raises the possibility that the deceiving spirit of vv. 20-22 is the same as the divine spirit mentioned by Zedekiah in v. 23. This would explain why the article is used on <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ruakh</font>); he can be called &#8220;the spirit&#8221; because he is the well-known spirit who energizes the prophets.</p>
<A NAME="1824"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=537><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (the <sc>Lord) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1825"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=538><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has two imperfects connected by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1490;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vÿgam</font>). These verbs could be translated as specific futures, &#8220;you will deceive and also you will prevail,&#8221; in which case the <sc>Lord is assuring the spirit of success on his mission. However, in a commissioning context (note the following imperatives) such as this, it is more likely that the imperfects are injunctive, in which case one could translate, &#8220;Deceive, and also overpower.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1826"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=539><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the bread of affliction and the water of affliction.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1827"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=540><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Listen.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1828"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=541><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verbal forms could be imperatives (&#8220;Disguise yourself and enter&#8221;), but this would make no sense in light of the immediately following context. The forms are better interpreted as infinitives absolute functioning as cohortatives (see <i>IBHS</i> 594 §35.5.2a). Some prefer to emend the forms to imperfects.</p>
<A NAME="1829"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=542><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;small or great.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1830"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=543><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;now a man drew a bow in his innocence&#8221; (i.e., with no specific target in mind, or at least without realizing his target was the king of Israel). </p>
<A NAME="1831"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=544><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (the king) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1832"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=545><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;camp.&#8221;</p>
