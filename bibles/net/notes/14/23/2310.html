<A NAME="2310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=701><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">edut</font>) normally means &#8220;witness&#8221; or &#8220;testimony.&#8221; Here it probably refers to some tangible symbol of kingship, perhaps a piece of jewelry such as an amulet or neck chain (see the discussion in M. Cogan and H. Tadmor, <i>II Kings </i>[AB], 128). Some suggest that a document is in view, perhaps a copy of the royal protocol or of the stipulations of the Davidic covenant (see <i>HALOT</i> 790-91 s.v.). </p>
