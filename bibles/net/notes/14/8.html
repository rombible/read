<A NAME="81"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=249><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Huram&#8221; (also in v. 18). Some medieval Hebrew <sc>mss, along with the LXX, Syriac, and Vulgate spell the name &#8220;Hiram,&#8221; agreeing with 1 Chr 14:1. &#8220;Huram&#8221; is a variant spelling referring to the same individual.</p>
<A NAME="82"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=250><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he built&#8230;[as] cities of fortification, [with] walls, doors, and a bar.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="83"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=251><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Solomon.&#8221; The recurrence of the proper name is unexpected in terms of contemporary English style, so the pronoun has been used in the translation instead.</p>
<A NAME="84"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=252><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the cities of the chariots and the cities of the horses.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="85"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=253><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</p>
<A NAME="86"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=254><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and all the desire of Solomon which he desired to build in Jerusalem and in Lebanon and in all the land of his kingdom.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="87"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=255><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all the people who were left from the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not from Israel.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="88"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=256><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;from their sons who were left after them in the land, whom the sons of Israel did not wipe out, and Solomon raised them up for a work crew to this day.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="89"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=257><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and from the sons of Israel which Solomon did not assign to the laborers for his work.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="810"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=258><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;officers of his chariots and his horses.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="811"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=259><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;these [were] the officials of the governors who belonged to the king, Solomon, 250, the ones ruling over the people.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="812"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=260><b>sn</b> The phrase <i>the City of David</i> refers here to the fortress of Zion in Jerusalem, not to Bethlehem. See 2 Sam 5:7.</p>
<A NAME="813"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=261><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the porch.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="814"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=262><b>tn</b> The Hebrew phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew"> &#1492;&#1463;&#1505;&#1468;&#1467;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font>[<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1463;&#1490;</font>] (<font face="Scholar">khag hassukot</font>, &#8220;[festival of] huts&#8221; [or &#8220;shelters&#8221;]) is traditionally known as the Feast of Tabernacles. The rendering &#8220;booths&#8221; (cf. NAB, NASB, NRSV) is probably better than the traditional &#8220;tabernacles&#8221; in light of the meaning of the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1467;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sukkah</font>, &#8220;hut; booth&#8221;), but &#8220;booths&#8221; are frequently associated with trade shows and craft fairs in contemporary American English. The nature of the celebration during this feast as a commemoration of the wanderings of the Israelites after they left Egypt suggests that a translation like &#8220;temporary shelters&#8221; is more appropriate.</p>
<A NAME="815"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=263><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Solomon) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="816"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=264><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the Levites, according to their posts, to praise and to serve opposite the priests according to the matter of a day in its day.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="817"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=265><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the gatekeepers by their divisions for a gate and a gate.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="818"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=266><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for so [was] the command of David the man of God.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="819"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=267><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they did not turn aside from the command of the king concerning the priests and the Levites with regard to any matter and with regard to the treasuries.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=268><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Huram sent to him by the hand of his servants, ships, and servants [who] know the sea, and they came with the servants of Solomon to Ophir.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="821"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=269><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kikar</font>, &#8220;circle&#8221;) refers generally to something that is round. When used of metals it can refer to a disk-shaped weight made of the metal or, by extension, to a standard unit of weight. According to the older (Babylonian) standard the &#8220;talent&#8221; weighed 130 lbs. (58.9 kg), but later this was lowered to 108.3 lbs. (49.1 kg). More recent research suggests the &#8220;light&#8221; standard talent was 67.3 lbs. (30.6 kg). Using this as the standard for calculation, the weight of the gold was 30,285 lbs. (13,770 kg).</p>
