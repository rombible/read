Yet v. 10 goes on to state that the Edomite revolt was successful. The translation above assumes an emendation of the Hebrew text. Adding a third masculine singular pronominal suffix to the accusative sign before Edom (reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1465;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">oto</font>, &#8220;him&#8221;] instead of just <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">et</font>]) and taking Edom as the subject of verbs allows one to translate the verse in a way that is more consistent with the context, which depicts an Israelite defeat, not victory.
