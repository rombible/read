<A NAME="646"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=177><b>tn</b> Actually two Hebrew words appear here, both of which are usually (but not always) taken as referring to locusts. Perhaps different stages of growth or different varieties are in view, but this is uncertain. NEB has &#8220;locusts new-sloughed or fully grown&#8221;; NASB has &#8220;locust or grasshopper&#8221;; NIV has &#8220;locusts or grasshoppers&#8221;; NRSV has &#8220;locust, or caterpillar.&#8221;</p>
