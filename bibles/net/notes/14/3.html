<A NAME="32"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=66><b>tn</b> In 2 Sam 24:16 this individual is called <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1512;&#1463;&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (&#8220;Aravna&#8221;; traditionally &#8220;Araunah&#8221;). The form of the name found here also occurs in 1 Chr 21:15; 18-28.</p>
<A NAME="33"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=67><b>sn</b> This would be April-May, 966 <sc>b.c. by modern reckoning.</p>
<A NAME="34"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=68><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and these are the founding of Solomon to build the house of God.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="35"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=69><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the length [in] cubits by the former measure was sixty cubits, and a width of twenty cubits.&#8221; Assuming a length of 18 inches (45 cm) for the standard cubit, the length of the foundation would be 90 feet (27 m) and its width 30 feet (9 m).</p>
<A NAME="36"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=70><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the porch which was in front of the length corresponding to the width of the house, twenty cubits.&#8221; The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1461;&#1497;&#1499;&#1463;&#1500; &#1492;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">heykhal habbayit</font>, &#8220;the main hall of the temple,&#8221; which appears in the parallel account in 1 Kgs 6:3) has been accidentally omitted by homoioarcton after <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al-pÿney</font>, &#8220;in front of&#8221;). Note that the following form, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1465;&#1512;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">orekh</font>, &#8220;the length&#8221;), also begins with the Hebrew letter <i>he</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;</font>). A scribe&#8217;s eye probably jumped from the initial <i>he</i> on <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1461;&#1497;&#1499;&#1463;&#1500;</font> to the initial <i>he</i> on <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1465;&#1512;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</font>, leaving out the intervening letters in the process.</p>
<A NAME="37"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=71><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text has &#8220;one hundred and twenty cubits,&#8221; i.e. (assuming a cubit of 18 inches) 180 feet (54 m). An ancient Greek witness and the Syriac version read &#8220;twenty cubits,&#8221; i.e., 30 feet (9 m). It is likely that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">me</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>, &#8220;a hundred&#8221;), is a corruption of an original <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ammot</font>, &#8220;cubits&#8221;).</p>

<A NAME="312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=76><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he plated the house [with] precious stone for beauty, and the gold was the gold of Parvaim.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The location of <i>Parvaim</i>, the source of the gold for Solomon&#8217;s temple, is uncertain. Some have identified it with modern Farwa in Yemen; others relate it to the Sanskrit <font face="Scholar">parvam</font> and understand it to be a general term for the regions east of Palestine.</p>
<A NAME="313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=77><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the house of the holy place of holy places.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=78><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;twenty cubits.&#8221; Assuming a cubit of 18 inches (45 cm), this would give a length of 30 feet (9 m).</p>
<A NAME="315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=79><b>tc</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;twenty cubits.&#8221; Some suggest adding, &#8220;and its height twenty cubits&#8221; (see 1 Kgs 6:20). The phrase could have been omitted by homoioteleuton.</p>
<A NAME="316"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=80><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kikar</font>, &#8220;circle&#8221;) refers generally to something that is round. When used of metals it can refer to a disk-shaped weight made of the metal or, by extension, to a standard unit of weight. According to the older (Babylonian) standard the &#8220;talent&#8221; weighed 130 lbs. (58.9 kg), but later this was lowered to 108.3 lbs. (49.1 kg). More recent research suggests the &#8220;light&#8221; standard talent was 67.3 lbs. (30.6 kg). Using this as the standard for calculation, the weight of the gold plating was 40,380 lbs. (18,360 kg).</p>
<A NAME="317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=81><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the wings of the cherubs, their length was twenty cubits.&#8221; Assuming a cubit of 18 inches (45 cm), the wingspan of the cherubs would have been 30 feet (9 m).</p>
<A NAME="318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=82><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the wing of the one was five cubits from the touching of the wall of the house, and the other wing was five cubits from the touching of the wing of the other cherub.&#8221; Assuming a cubit of 18 inches (45 cm), each wing would have been 7.5 feet (2.25 m) long.</p>
<A NAME="319"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=83><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and the wing of the one (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1491;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ekhad</font>, &#8220;the one&#8221;; this should probably be emended to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1461;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">akher</font>, &#8220;the other&#8221;) cherub was five cubits, touching the wall of the house, and the other wing was five cubits, clinging to the wing of the other cherub.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="320"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=84><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the wings of these cherubs were spreading twenty cubits.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=85><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they were standing on their feet, with their faces to the house.&#8221; An alternative translation of the last clause would be, &#8220;with their faces to the main hall.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="322"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=86><b>sn</b> The figure given here appears to refer to the combined length of both pillars (perhaps when laid end-to-end on the ground prior to being set up; cf. v. 17); the figure given for the height of the pillars in 1 Kgs 7:15, 2 Kgs 25:17, and Jer 52:21 is half this (i.e., eighteen cubits).</p>
<A NAME="323"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=87><b>tc</b> The Syriac reads &#8220;eighteen cubits&#8221; (twenty-seven feet). This apparently reflects an attempt at harmonization with 1 Kgs 7:15, 2 Kgs 25:17, and Jer 52:21.</p>
<A NAME="324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=88><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and he made before the house two pillars, thirty-five cubits [in] length, and the plated capital which was on its top [was] five cubits.&#8221; The significance of the measure &#8220;thirty-five cubits&#8221; (52.5 feet or 15.75 m, assuming a cubit of 18 inches) for the &#8220;length&#8221; of the pillars is uncertain. According to 1 Kgs 7:15, each pillar was eighteen cubits (27 feet or 8.1 m) high. Perhaps the measurement given here was taken with the pillars lying end-to-end on the ground before they were set up.</p>
<A NAME="325"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=89><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text adds here, &#8220;in the inner sanctuary,&#8221; but the description at this point is of the pillars, not the inner sanctuary.</p>
<A NAME="326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=90><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;one on the south and the other on the north.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=91><b>tn</b> The name &#8220;Jachin&#8221; appears to be a verbal form and probably means, &#8220;he establishes.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="328"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=92><b>tn</b> The meaning of the name &#8220;Boaz&#8221; is uncertain. For various proposals, see BDB 126-27 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1465;&#1506;&#1463;&#1494;</font>. One attractive option is to revocalize the name as<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1456;&#1468;&#1506;&#1465;&#1494;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bÿ</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">oz</font>, &#8220;in strength&#8221;) and to understand it as completing the verbal form on the first pillar. Taking the words together and reading from right to left, one can translate the sentence, &#8220;he establishes [it] in strength.&#8221;</p>
