The conditional sentence used in the present translation is an attempt to bring out the logical relationship between these forms. </p>
<A NAME="106"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=333><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;stood before.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="109"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=336><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Rehoboam rejected the advice of the elders which they advised and he consulted the young men with whom he had grown up, who stood before him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1010"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=337><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Lighten the yoke which your father placed on us.&#8221;</p>

The traditional view is that it refers to the little finger (so NEB, NASB, NIV, NRSV, NLT). As the following statement makes clear, Rehoboam&#8217;s point is that he is more harsh and demanding than his father.</p>

<A NAME="1016"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=343><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Rehoboam.&#8221; The pronoun &#8220;he&#8221; has been used in the translation in place of the proper name in keeping with contemporary English style.</p>
<A NAME="1017"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=344><b>tc</b> The Hebrew text reads, &#8220;I will make heavy your yoke,&#8221; but many medieval Hebrew <sc>mss and other ancient textual witnesses have, &#8220;my father made heavy your yoke.&#8221; </p>

<A NAME="1023"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=350><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;each one to your tents, Israel.&#8221; The word &#8220;return&#8221; is supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons.</p>
