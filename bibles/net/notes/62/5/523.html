<A NAME="523"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=245><b>tn</b> The use of the aorist participle (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969; &#957;&#953;&#954;&#8053;&#963;&#945;&#963;&#945;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Jh nikhsasa</font>) to refer to faith as the conquering power that &#8220;has conquered the world&#8221; in 5:4b is problematic. Debate here centers over the temporal value of the aorist participle: (1) It may indicate an action contemporaneous with the (present tense) main verb, in which case the alternation between aorist participle in 5:4b and present participle in 5:5 is one more example of the author&#8217;s love of stylistic variation with no difference in meaning. (2) Nevertheless, an aorist participle with a present tense main verb would normally indicate an action antecedent to that of the main verb, so that the aorist participle would describe a past action. That is the most probable here. Thus the aorist participle stresses that the conquest of the world is something that has already been accomplished.</p>
