<A NAME="534"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=256><b>sn</b> <i>The one who has the Son. </i>The expression &#8220;to have the Son&#8221; in 5:12 means to &#8220;possess&#8221; him in the sense that he is present in the individual&#8217;s life (see 1 John 2:23 for the use of the Greek verb &#8220;to have&#8221; to indicate possession of a divine reality). From the parallel statement in 5:10a it is clear that believing in the Son and thus having God&#8217;s testimony in one&#8217;s self is the same as &#8220;having&#8221; the Son here in 5:12a. This is essentially identical to John 3:16: &#8220;that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.&#8221; In contrast, the negative statement in 5:12b reflects the author&#8217;s evaluation of the opponents: &#8220;the one who does not have the Son does not have (eternal) life.&#8221; The opponents, in spite of their claims to know God, do not possess (nor have they at any time possessed, cf. 2:19) eternal life.</p>
