<A NAME="511"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=233><b>sn</b> <i>Also loves the child fathered by him. </i>Is the meaning of 5:1b a general observation or a specific statement about God and Christians? There are three ways in which the second half of 5:1 has been understood: (1) as a general statement, proverbial in nature, applying to any parent: &#8220;everyone who loves the father also loves the child fathered by him.&#8221; (2) This has also been understood as a statement that is particularly true of one&#8217;s own parent: &#8220;everyone who loves his own father also loves the (other) children fathered by him (i.e., one&#8217;s own brothers and sisters).&#8221; (3) This could be understood as a statement which refers particularly to God, in light of the context (5:1a): &#8220;everyone who loves God who fathered Christians also loves the Christians who are fathered by God.&#8221; Without doubt options (2) and (3) are implications of the statement in its present context, but it seems most probable that the meaning of the statement is more general and proverbial in nature (option 1). This is likely because of the way in which it is introduced by the author with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#8118;&#962; &#8001;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pas Jo</font>) + participle. The author could have been more explicit and said something like, &#8220;everyone who loves God also loves God&#8217;s children&#8221; had he intended option (3) without ambiguity. Yet that, in context, is the ultimate <i>application</i> of the statement, because it ultimately refers to the true Christian who, because he loves God, also loves the brethren, those who are God&#8217;s offspring. This is the opposite of 4:20, where the author asserted that the opponents, who profess to love God but do not love the brethren, cannot really love God because they do not love the brethren.</p>
