<A NAME="552"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=274><b>tn</b> The meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#948;&#953;&#954;&#943;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">adikia</font>) here is &#8220;unrighteousness&#8221; (BDAG 20 s.v. 2). It refers to the opposite of that which is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#943;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">dikaios</font>, &#8220;right, just, righteous&#8221;) which is used by the author to describe both God and Jesus Christ (1 John 1:9; 2:2, 29). Here, having implied that sins committed by believers (sins &#8220;not to death&#8221;) may be prayed for and forgiven, the author does not want to leave the impression that such sin is insignificant, because this could be viewed as a concession to the views of the opponents (who as moral indifferentists have downplayed the significance of sin in the Christian&#8217;s life).</p>
