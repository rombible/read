<A NAME="513"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=235><b>tn</b> The force of the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#940;&#961;</font> (<font face="Greektl">gar</font>) at the beginning of 5:3 is similar to another introductory formula used by the author of 1 John, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#945;&#8021;&#964;&#951; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#943;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai Jauth estin</font>; used in 1:5; 5:4, 11, and 14). The <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#940;&#961;</font> draws an inference based on the preceding statements, particularly the one in 5:2b, regarding the love of God. If in 5:2 loving God and keeping his commandments is the key to knowing that we love God&#8217;s children, it is important to define what the love of God involves, and this is what the author is doing in 5:3. In fact, as the following <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jina</font>) clause makes clear, loving God consists in keeping his commandments.</p>
