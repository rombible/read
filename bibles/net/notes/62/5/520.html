<A NAME="520"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=242><b>sn</b> <i>Conquers the world. </i>Once again, the author&#8217;s language is far from clear at this point, and so is his meaning, but the author has used the verb <i>conquers</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#957;&#953;&#954;&#940;&#969;</font>, <font face="Greektl">nikaw</font>) previously to describe the believer&#8217;s victory over the enemy, the evil one himself, in 2:13-14, and over the secessionist opponents, described as &#8220;false prophets&#8221; in 4:4. This suggests that what the author has in mind here is a victory over the opponents, who now belong to the <i>world</i> and speak its language (cf. 4:5). In the face of the opponents&#8217; attempts through their false teaching to confuse the readers (true believers) about who it is they are supposed to love, the author assures the readers that loving God and keeping his commandments assures us that we really do love God&#8217;s children, and because we have already achieved victory over the world through our faith, keeping God&#8217;s commandments is not a difficult matter.</p>
