<A NAME="530"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=252><b>tn</b> The second <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joti</font>) in 5:9 may be understood in three different ways. (1) It may be causal, in which case it gives the <i>reason</i> why the testimony just mentioned is God&#8217;s testimony: &#8220;because he has testified concerning his Son.&#8221; This is extremely awkward because of the preceding <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause which is almost certainly causal (although the second <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> could perhaps be resumptive in force, continuing the first). (2) The second <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> could be understood as epexegetical (explanatory), in which case it explains <i>what</i> the testimony of God mentioned in the preceding clause consists of: &#8220;because this is the testimony of God, [namely,] that he has testified concerning his Son.&#8221; This is much smoother grammatically, but encounters the logical problem that &#8220;the testimony of God&#8221; is defined in 5:11 (&#8220;And this is the testimony: that God has given us eternal life&#8221;) and the two definitions of what the testimony of God consists of are not identical (some would say that they are not even close). Thus (3) the smoothest way to understand the second <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> logically is to read it as a relative pronoun: &#8220;because this is the testimony of God <i>that</i> he has testified concerning his Son.&#8221; In this case it is exactly parallel to the relative clause which occurs in 5:10b: &#8220;because he has not believed the testimony <i>that</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7971;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Jhn</font>) God has testified concerning his Son.&#8221; (There is in fact a textual problem with the second <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> in 5:9: The Byzantine tradition, along with ms P, reads a relative pronoun [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7971;&#957;</font>] in place of the second <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> in 5:9 identical to the relative pronoun in 5:10b. This represents an obvious effort on the part of scribes to smooth out the reading of the text.) In an effort to derive a similar sense from the second <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> in 5:9 it has been suggested that the conjunction <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> should be read as an indefinite relative pronoun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> (sometimes written <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005; &#964;&#953;</font>). The problem with this suggestion is the use of the neuter relative pronoun to refer to a feminine antecedent (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969; &#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#965;&#961;&#943;&#945;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Jh marturia</font>). It is not without precedent for a neuter relative pronoun to refer to an antecedent of differing gender, especially as some forms tended to become fixed in usage and were used without regard to agreement. But in this particular context it is difficult to see why the author would use a neuter indefinite relative pronoun here in 5:9b and then use the normal feminine relative pronoun (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7971;&#957;</font>) in the next verse. (Perhaps this strains at the limits of even the notorious Johannine preference for stylistic variation, although it is impossible to say what the author might or might not have been capable of doing.) Because of the simplicity and logical smoothness which results from reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> as equivalent to a relative pronoun, the third option is preferred, although it is not without its difficulties (as are all three options).</p>
