<A NAME="559"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=281><b>sn</b> The pronoun <i>This one</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8023;&#964;&#959;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Joutos</font>) refers to a person, but it is far from clear whether it should be understood as a reference (1) to God the Father or (2) to Jesus Christ. R. E. Brown (<i>Epistles of John </i>[AB], 625) comments, &#8220;I John, which began with an example of stunning grammatical obscurity in the prologue, continues to the end to offer us examples of unclear grammar.&#8221; The nearest previous antecedent is <i>Jesus Christ</i>, immediately preceding, but on some occasions when this has been true the pronoun still refers to God (see 1 John 2:3). The first predicate which follows <i>This one</i> in 5:20, <i>the true God</i>, is a description of God the Father used by Jesus in John 17:3, and was used in the preceding clause of the present verse to refer to God the Father (<i>him who is true</i>). Yet the second predicate of <i>This one</i> in 5:20, <i>eternal life</i>, appears to refer to Jesus, because although the Father possesses &#8220;life&#8221; (John 5:26, 6:57) just as Jesus does (John 1:4, 6:57, 1 John 5:11), &#8220;life&#8221; is <i>never</i> predicated of the Father elsewhere, while it is predicated of Jesus in John 11:25 and 14:6 (a self-predication by Jesus). If <i>This one</i> in 5:20 is understood as referring to Jesus, it forms an inclusion with the prologue, which introduced the reader to &#8220;the eternal <i>life</i> which was with the Father and was manifested to us.&#8221; Thus it appears best to understand the pronoun <i>This one</i> in 5:20 as a reference to Jesus Christ. The christological affirmation which results is striking, but certainly not beyond the capabilities of the author (see John 1:1 and 20:28): <i>This One [Jesus Christ] is the true God and eternal life</i>.</p>
