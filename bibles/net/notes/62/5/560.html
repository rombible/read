<A NAME="560"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">60</span><note=282><b>tc</b> Most later <sc>mss (P <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>) have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">amhn</font>, &#8220;amen&#8221;) at the end of this letter. Such a conclusion is routinely added by scribes to NT books because a few of these books originally had such an ending (cf. Rom 16:27; Gal 6:18; Jude 25). A majority of Greek witnesses have the concluding <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957; </font>in every NT book except Acts, James, and 3 John (and even in these books, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font> is found in some witnesses). It is thus a predictable variant. Further, the earliest and best witnesses, along with several others (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A B <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 33 323 630 1505 1739 <i>al</i> sy co), lack the inoffensive particle, rendering its omission as the authentic reading.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The modern reader may wonder what all this has to do with idolatry. In the author&#8217;s mind, to follow the secessionist opponents with their false Christology would amount to idolatry, since it would involve worshiping a false god instead of the true God, Jesus Christ. Thus <i>guard yourselves from idols</i> means for the readers to guard themselves against the opponents and their teaching.</p>
