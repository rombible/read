<A NAME="526"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=248><b>tn</b> A second causal <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joti</font>) clause (after the one at the end of the preceding verse) is somewhat awkward, especially since the reasons offered in each are somewhat different. The content of the second <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause (the one in question here) goes somewhat beyond the content of the first. The first <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause, the one at the end of 5:6, stated the <i>reason</i> why the Spirit is the witness: because the Spirit is the truth. The second <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause, here, states that there are three witnesses, of which the Spirit is one. It is probably best, therefore, to understand this second <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> as indicating a somewhat looser connection than the first, not strictly causal but inferential in sense (the English translation &#8220;for&#8221; captures this inferential sense). See BDF §456.1 for a discussion of this &#8216;looser&#8217; use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font>.</p>
