<A NAME="545"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=267><b>tn</b> Again <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#940;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ean</font>) in 5:16 introduces (as in 5:14) a third-class condition, but this time, with the future indicative (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#7984;&#964;&#8053;&#963;&#949;&#953;</font>, <font face="Greektl">aithsei</font>) in the apodosis, the condition is known as &#8220;more probable future.&#8221; As BDF §371.4 points out, such a condition describes what is to be expected under certain circumstances. If a person sees his Christian brother committing a sin not to death, it is expected that he will make intercession for the sinning brother (&#8220;he should ask&#8230;&#8221;), and that life will be granted to the sinner in answer to the request. The author has already pointed out in 5:14-15 that if believers make requests of God in accordance with his will they may have confidence that they will receive the requests they have asked for, and this is a specific instance.</p>
