However, BDF §138.1 explains that &#8220;the neuter is sometimes used with respect to persons if it is not the individuals but a generic quality that is to be emphasized&#8221;; this seems to be the case here, where a collective aspect is in view: As a group, all those who have been begotten by God, that is, all true believers, overcome the world.</p>
