<A NAME="549"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=271><b>tn</b> The referent of the (understood) third person subject of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#8061;&#963;&#949;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">dwsei</font>) in 5:16 is difficult to determine. Once again the author&#8217;s meaning is obscure. Several possibilities have been suggested for the referent of the subject of this verb: (1) From a grammatical and syntactical standpoint, it would be easiest to understand the subject of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#8061;&#963;&#949;&#953;</font> in 5:16 as the person who makes the request, since this person is the subject of the preceding verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#7984;&#964;&#8053;&#963;&#949;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">aithsei</font>) and the following verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#961;&#969;&#964;&#8053;&#963;&#8131;</font> (<font face="Greektl">erwthsh</font>). From a theological standpoint this is extremely difficult, however, since it would make the person who prays for the sinner the giver of life, and it is questionable whether the author (for whom God is the ultimate source of life) would say that one believer could &#8216;give&#8217; life to another. In this case the meaning would be: &#8220;he [the petitioner] should ask, and he [the petitioner] will grant life to him [the sinner], namely, to those who sin not to death.&#8221; (2) Another option is to see God as the subject of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#8061;&#963;&#949;&#953;</font> in 5:16 and the Giver of life to the sinner. This is far more consistent theologically with the author&#8217;s perspective on God as the Giver of life everywhere else, but it is awkward grammatically (as explained in reference to the previous position above) because it involves a shift in subjects for the three third-person verbs in the context from the person who makes the request (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#7984;&#964;&#8053;&#963;&#949;&#953;</font>) to God (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#8061;&#963;&#949;&#953;</font>) and back to the person who makes the request (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#961;&#969;&#964;&#8053;&#963;&#8131;</font>). In this case the meaning would be: &#8220;he [the petitioner] should ask, and he [God] will grant life to him [the sinner], namely, to those who sin not to death.&#8221; (3) A third possibility is to see God as the subject of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#8061;&#963;&#949;&#953;</font> in 5:16, but the person who makes the request (rather than the sinner) as the referent of the indirect object <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183;</font> (<font face="Greektl">autw</font>) in 5:16. This is possible because the indirect object <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183;</font> is singular, while the dative substantival participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#7937;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#940;&#957;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">toi&quot; Jamartanousin</font>) which follows (which clearly refers to those who sin) is plural. Thus the meaning would be: &#8220;he [the petitioner] should ask, and he [God] will grant life to him [the petitioner], with reference to [his praying for] those who sin not to death.&#8221; Although this is a difficult and awkward construction no matter what solution one takes, on the whole the second alternative seems most probable. Even if option (1) is preferred it must be acknowledged that God is ultimately the source of life, although it is given as a result of the petitioner&#8217;s intercessory prayer and the petitioner becomes, in a sense, the intermediate agent. But in the preceding context (5:11) the author has emphasized that God is the Giver of life, and in spite of the awkwardness in the change of subjects, that would seem to be the most likely meaning here, so option (2) is preferred. Option (3) is improbable because it seems clear that it should be the sinner for whom intercession is made, rather than the petitioner, who is the recipient of life. The petitioner would be assumed to possess life already or he could not be making a request which God would hear. In this case the change from the singular dative indirect object (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183;</font>) to the plural dative substantival participle (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#7937;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#940;&#957;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#957;</font>) is merely a loose construction (which by this time should come as no surprise from the author).</p>
