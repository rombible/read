<A NAME="556"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=278><b>tn</b> The meaning of the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#947;&#949;&#957;&#957;&#951;&#952;&#949;&#8054;&#962; &#7952;&#954; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166; &#964;&#951;&#961;&#949;&#8150; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#972;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jo gennhqeis ek tou qeou threi auton</font>) in 5:18 is extraordinarily difficult. Again the author&#8217;s capacity for making obscure statements results in several possible meanings for this phrase: (1) &#8220;The fathering by God protects him [the Christian].&#8221; Here a textual variant for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#947;&#949;&#957;&#957;&#951;&#952;&#949;&#943;&#962;</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969; &#947;&#941;&#957;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Jh gennhsi&quot;</font>) has suggested to some that the passive participle should be understood as a noun (&#8220;fathering&#8221; or perhaps &#8220;birth&#8221;), but the ms evidence is extremely slight (1505 1852 2138 latt [sy<sup>h</sup>] bo). This almost certainly represents a scribal attempt to clarify an obscure phrase. (2) &#8220;The One fathered by God [Jesus] protects him [the Christian].&#8221; This is a popular interpretation, and is certainly possible grammatically. Yet the introduction of a reference to Jesus in this context is sudden; to be unambiguous the author could have mentioned the &#8220;Son of God&#8221; here, or used the pronoun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954;&#949;&#8150;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ekeinos</font>) as a reference to Jesus as he consistently does elsewhere in 1 John. This interpretation, while possible, seems in context highly unlikely. (3) &#8220;The one fathered by God [the Christian] protects himself.&#8221; Again a textual problem is behind this alternative, since a number of <sc>mss (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A<sup>c</sup> P <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 33 1739 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>) supply the reflexive pronoun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7953;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#972;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jeauton</font>) in place of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#972;&#957;</font> in 5:18. On the basis of the external evidence this has a good possibility of being the original reading, but internal evidence favors <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#972;&#957;</font> as the more difficult reading, since <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7953;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#972;&#957;</font> may be explained as a scribal attempt at grammatical smoothness. From a logical standpoint, however, it is difficult to make much more sense out of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7953;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#972;&#957;</font>; to say what &#8220;the Christian protects himself&#8221; means in the context is far from clear. (4) &#8220;The one fathered by God [the Christian] holds on to him [God].&#8221; This results in further awkwardness, because the third person pronoun (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</font>, <font face="Greektl">autou</font>) in the following clause must refer to the Christian, not God. Furthermore, although <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#951;&#961;&#941;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">threw</font>) can mean &#8220;hold on to&#8221; (BDAG 1002 s.v. 2.c), this is not a common meaning for the verb in Johannine usage, occurring elsewhere only in Rev 3:3. (5) &#8220;The one fathered by God [the Christian], he [God] protects him [the Christian].&#8221; This involves a <i>pendant nominative</i> construction (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#947;&#949;&#957;&#957;&#951;&#952;&#949;&#8054;&#962; &#7952;&#954; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font>) where a description of something within the clause is placed in the nominative case and moved forward ahead of the clause for emphatic reasons. This may be influenced by Semitic style; such a construction is also present in John 17:2 (&#8220;in order that <i>everyone</i> whom You have given to him, he may give <i>to them</i> eternal life&#8221;). This view is defended by K. Beyer (<i>Semitische Syntax im Neuen Testament</i> [SUNT], 1:216ff.) and appears to be the most probable in terms both of syntax and of sense. It makes God the protector of the Christian (rather than the Christian himself), which fits the context much better, and there is precedent in Johannine literature for such syntactical structure.</p>
