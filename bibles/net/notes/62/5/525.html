<A NAME="525"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=247><b>tn</b> This <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joti</font>) is best understood (1) as causal. Some have taken it (2) as declarative, giving the <i>content</i> of the Spirit&#8217;s testimony: &#8220;and the Spirit is the One who testifies that the Spirit is the truth.&#8221; This is certainly possible, since a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause following the cognate verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#965;&#961;&#941;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">marturevw</font>) often gives the content of the testimony (cf. John 1:34; 3:28; 4:39, 44). But in the Gospel of John the Spirit never bears witness on his own behalf, but always on behalf of Jesus (John 15:26, 16:13). There are, in fact, some instances in the Gospel of John where a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause following <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#965;&#961;&#941;&#969;</font> is <i>causal</i> (8:14, 15:27), and that is more likely here: &#8220;and the Spirit is the One who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth.&#8221;</p>
