<A NAME="533"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=255><b>sn</b> In understanding how &#8220;God&#8217;s testimony&#8221; (added to the three witnesses of 5:8) can consist of <i>eternal life</i> it is important to remember the debate between the author and the opponents. It is not the reality of eternal life (whether it exists at all or not) that is being debated here, but rather which side in the debate (the author and his readers or the opponents) possesses it (this is a key point). The letter began with a testimony that &#8220;the eternal life&#8221; has been revealed (1:2), and it is consummated here with the reception or acknowledgment of that eternal life as the final testimony. This testimony (which is God&#8217;s testimony) consists in eternal life itself, which the author and the readers possess, but the opponents do not. This, for the author, constitutes the final apologetic in his case against the opponents.</p>
