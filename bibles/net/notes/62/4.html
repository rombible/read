<A NAME="41"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=175><b>sn</b> <i>1 John 4:1-6. </i>These verses form one of three units within 1 John that almost all interpreters consider a single unit and do not divide up (the other two are 2:12-14 and 15-17). The subject matter is so clearly different from the surrounding context that these clearly constitute separate units of thought. Since the Holy Spirit is not the only spirit active in the world, the author needs to qualify for the recipients how to tell if a spirit comes from God. The &#8220;test&#8221; is the confession in 4:2.</p>
<A NAME="42"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=176><b>tn</b> According to BDAG 255 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#959;&#954;&#953;&#956;&#940;&#950;&#969;</font> 1 the verb means &#8220;to make a critical examination of someth. to determine genuineness, <i>put to the test, examine</i>.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="43"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=177><b>sn</b> <i>Test the spirits. </i>Since in the second half of the present verse the author mentions &#8220;false prophets&#8221; who have &#8220;gone out into the world,&#8221; it appears highly probable that his concept of testing the spirits is drawn from the OT concept of testing a prophet to see whether he is a false prophet or a true one. The procedure for testing a prophet is found in Deut 13:2-6 and 18:15-22. An OT prophet was to be tested on the basis of (a) whether or not his predictive prophecies came true (Deut 18:22) and (b) whether or not he advocated idolatry (Deut 13:1-3). In the latter case the people of Israel are warned that even if the prophet should perform an authenticating sign or wonder, his truth or falsity is still to be judged on the basis of his claims, that is, whether or not he advocates idolatry. Here in 1 John the idea of &#8220;testing the spirits&#8221; comes closer to the second OT example of &#8220;testing the prophets&#8221; mentioned above. According to 1 John 4:2-3, the spirits are to be tested on the basis of their christological confession: The person motivated by the Spirit of God will confess <i>Jesus as the Christ who has come in the flesh</i>, while the person motivated by the spirit of deceit will not <i>confess Jesus</i> and is therefore not from God. This comes close to the idea expressed by Paul in 1 Cor 12:3 where the person speaking charismatic utterances is also to be judged on the basis of his christological confession: &#8220;So I want you to understand that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, &#8216;Jesus is cursed,&#8217; and no one can say &#8216;Jesus is Lord,&#8217; except by the Holy Spirit.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="47"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=181><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;acknowledges.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="48"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=182><b>tn</b> This forms part of the author&#8217;s christological confession which serves as a test of the spirits. Many interpreters have speculated that the author of 1 John is here correcting or adapting a slogan of the secessionist opponents, but there is no concrete evidence for this in the text. Such a possibility is mere conjecture (see R. E. Brown, <i>Epistles of John </i>[AB], 492). The phrase may be understood in a number of different ways, however: (1) the entire phrase &#8220;Jesus Christ come in the flesh&#8221; may be considered the single object of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001;&#956;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#949;&#8150;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jomologei</font>; so B. F. Westcott, A. Brooke, J. Bonsirven, R. E. Brown, S. Smalley, and others); (2) the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001;&#956;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#949;&#8150;</font> may be followed by a double accusative, so that both &#8220;Jesus Christ&#8221; and &#8220;come in the flesh&#8221; are objects of the verb; the meaning would be &#8220;confess Jesus Christ as come in the flesh&#8221; (so B. Weiss, J. Chaine, and others). (3) Another possibility is to see the verb as followed by a double accusative as in (2), but in this case the first object is &#8220;Jesus&#8221; and the second is &#8220;the Christ come in the flesh,&#8221; so that what is being confessed is &#8220;Jesus <i>as</i> the Christ come in the flesh&#8221; (so N. Alexander, J. Stott, J. Houlden, and others). All three options are grammatically possible, although not equally probable. Option (1) has a number of points in its favor: (a) the parallel in 2 John 7 suggests to some that the phrase should be understood as a single object; (b) option (2) makes &#8220;Jesus Christ&#8221; the name of the preincarnate second Person of the Trinity, and this would be the <i>only</i> place in the Johannine literature where such a designation for the preincarnate <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#923;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Logos</font>) occurs; and (c) option (3) would have been much clearer if <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#972;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Criston</font>) were accompanied by the article (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001;&#956;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#949;&#8150; &#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#957; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#972;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Jomologei Ihsoun ton Criston</font>). Nevertheless option (3) is preferred on the basis of the overall context involving the secessionist opponents: Their christological views would allow the confession of the Christ come in the flesh (perhaps in the sense of the Spirit indwelling believers, although this is hard to prove), but they would have trouble confessing that <i>Jesus</i> was (exclusively) the Christ incarnate. The author&#8217;s failure to repeat the qualifying phrases (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#7952;&#957; &#963;&#945;&#961;&#954;&#8054; &#7952;&#955;&#951;&#955;&#965;&#952;&#972;&#964;&#945;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Criston en sarki elhluqota</font>) in the negative repetition in 4:3a actually suggests that the stress is on <i>Jesus</i> as the confession the opponents could not or would not make. It is difficult to see how the parallel in 2 John 7 favors option (1), although R. E. Brown (<i>Epistles of John </i>[AB]<i>, </i>492) thinks it does. The related or parallel construction in John 9:22 (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#940;&#957; &#964;&#953;&#962; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#8001;&#956;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#8053;&#963;&#8131; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#972;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">ean ti&quot; auton Jomologhsh Criston</font>) provides further support for option (3). This is discounted by R. E. Brown because the verb in John 9:22 occurs between the two accusative objects rather than preceding both as here (<i>Epistles of John </i>[AB], 493 &#8211; although Brown does mention Rom 10:9 as another parallel closer in grammatical structure to 1 John 4:2). Brown does not mention the textual variants in John 9:22, however: Both <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>66</sup> and <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>75</sup> (along with K, <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13</sup> and others) read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001;&#956;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#8053;&#963;&#8131; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#972;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jomologhsh auton Criston</font>). This structure exactly parallels 1 John 4:2, and a case can be made that this is actually the preferred reading in John 9:22; furthermore, it is clear from the context in John 9:22 that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#972;&#957;</font> is the complement (what is predicated of the first accusative) since the object (the first accusative) is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#972;&#957;</font> rather than the proper name <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#957;</font>. The parallel in John 9:22 thus appears to be clearer than either 1 John 4:2 or 2 John 7, and thus to prove useful in understanding both the latter constructions.</p>

Thus it is adversative in force: &#8220;every spirit that confesses Jesus as Christ who has come in the flesh is from God, <i>but</i> every Spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="415"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=189><b>tn</b> The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#959;&#965;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ek toutou</font>) in 4:6, which bears obvious similarity to the much more common phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#8179;</font> (<font face="Greektl">en toutw</font>), must refer to what precedes, since there is nothing in the following context for it to relate to, and 4:1-6 is recognized by almost everyone as a discrete unit. There is still a question, however, of <i>what</i> in the preceding context the phrase refers to. Interpreters have suggested a reference (1) only to 4:6; (2) to 4:4-6; or (3) to all of 4:1-6. The last is most likely, because the present phrase forms an inclusion with the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#8179;</font> in 3:24 which introduces the present section. Thus &#8220;by this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of deceit&#8221; refers to all of 4:1-6 with its &#8220;test&#8221; of the spirits by the christological confession made by their adherents in 4:1-3 and with its emphasis on the authoritative (apostolic) eyewitness testimony to the significance of Jesus&#8217; earthly life and ministry in 4:4-6.</p>
<A NAME="416"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=190><b>sn</b> Who or what is <i>the Spirit of truth and the spirit of deceit</i> in 1 John 4:6? (1) Some interpreters regard the &#8220;spirits&#8221; in 4:6 as human spirits. Although 4:1a is ambiguous and might refer either to human spirits or spiritual beings who influence people, it is clear in the context that (2) the author sees behind the secessionist opponents with their false Christology the spirit of the Antichrist, that is, Satan (4:3b), and behind the true believers of the community to which he is writing, the Spirit of God (4:2). This is made clear in 4:4 by the reference to the respective spirits as <i>the One who is in you</i> and <i>the one who is in the world</i>.</p>
<A NAME="417"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=191><b>tn</b> This <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joti</font>) is causal, giving the reason why the readers, as believers, ought to love one another: because love comes from God. The next clause, introduced by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>), does not give a second reason (i.e., is not related to the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause), but introduces a second and additional thought: Everyone who loves is fathered by God and knows God.</p>
<A NAME="418"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=192><b>tn</b> As in 2:23 and 3:4, the author uses <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#8118;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pas</font>) with the present articular participle as a generalization to describe a category of people.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> From the author&#8217;s &#8220;either/or&#8221; perspective (which tends to see things in terms of polar opposites) the use of a generalization like <i>everyone who</i> presents a way of categorizing the opponents on the one hand and the recipients, whom the author regards as genuine Christians, on the other. Thus <i>everyone who loves</i> refers to all true Christians, who give evidence by their love for one another that they have indeed been begotten by God and are thus God&#8217;s children. The opposite situation is described in the following verse, 4:8, where (although <i>everyone</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#8118;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">pas</font>] is omitted) it is clear that a contrast is intended.</p>
<A NAME="419"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=193><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#949;&#957;&#957;&#940;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">gennaw</font>) in this context means <i>to be fathered by God</i> and thus a child of God. The imagery in 1 John is that of the male parent who fathers children (see especially 3:9 and 5:1).</p>
<A NAME="420"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=194><b>tn</b> The author proclaims in 4:8 <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#952;&#949;&#8056;&#962; &#7936;&#947;&#940;&#960;&#951; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#943;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jo qeo&quot; agaph estin</font>), but from a grammatical standpoint this is not a proposition in which subject and predicate nominative are interchangeable (&#8220;God is love&#8221; does not equal &#8220;love is God&#8221;). The predicate noun is anarthrous, as it is in two other Johannine formulas describing God, &#8220;God is light&#8221; in 1 John 1:5 and &#8220;God is Spirit&#8221; in John 4:24. The anarthrous predicate suggests a qualitative force, not a mere abstraction, so that a quality of God&#8217;s character is what is described here.</p>
<A NAME="421"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=195><b>tn</b> Once again there is the problem of determining whether the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#8179;</font> (<font face="Greektl">en toutw</font>) refers (1) to what precedes or (2) to what follows. This is the first of 5 uses of the phrase in the present section (4:9, 10, 13, 17; 5:2). In this case (as also in the next two instances) there is a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joti</font>) clause following which is related and which explains (i.e., which is epexegetical to) the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#8179;</font>. Thus the meaning here is, &#8220;<i>By this</i> the love of God is revealed in us: <i>that</i> God has sent his only Son into the world in order that we might live through him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="422"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=196><b>tn</b> In terms of syntax the force of the genitive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">tou qeou</font>) may be (1) objective, (2) subjective, or (3) both. The phrase occurs for the first time in the letter in 2:5. Here in 4:9 the epexegetical <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joti</font>) clause which follows makes it clear that this is a subjective genitive, emphasizing <i>God&#8217;s love for us</i> rather than our love for God, because it describes God&#8217;s action in sending his Son into the world.</p>
<A NAME="423"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=197><b>tn</b> This phrase is best understood as the equivalent of a dative of sphere, but this description does not specify <i>where</i> the love of God is revealed with regard to believers: &#8220;in our midst&#8221; (i.e., among us) or &#8220;within us&#8221; (i.e., internally within believers). The latter is probable, because in the context the concept of God&#8217;s indwelling of the believer is mentioned in 4:12: &#8220;God resides (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#953;</font>, <font face="Greektl">menei</font>) in us.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="424"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=198><b>sn</b> Although the word translated <i>one and only</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#8053;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">monogenhs</font>) is often rendered &#8220;only begotten,&#8221; such a translation is misleading, since in English it appears to express a metaphysical relationship. The word in Greek was used of an only child (a son [Luke 7:12, 9:38] or a daughter [Luke 8:42]). It was also used of something unique (only one of its kind) such as the mythological bird called the Phoenix (1 Clement 25:2). From here it passes easily to a description of Isaac (Heb 11:17 and Josephus, <i>Ant.</i> 1.13.1 [1.222]) who was not Abraham&#8217;s <i>only</i> son, but was one-of-a-kind because he was the child of the promise. Thus the word means &#8220;one-of-a-kind&#8221; and is reserved for Jesus alone in the Johannine literature of the NT. While all Christians are children of God (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#941;&#954;&#957;&#945; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font>, <font face="Greektl">tekna qeou</font>), Jesus is God&#8217;s Son in a unique, one-of-a-kind sense. The word is used in this way in all its uses in the Gospel of John (1:14, 18; 3:16, 18).</p>

This latter point is similar to the point made in 2:2 and is at the heart of the author&#8217;s dispute with the opponents, because they were denying any salvific value to Jesus&#8217; earthly life and ministry, including his death on the cross.</p>
<A NAME="427"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=201><b>sn</b> As explained at 2:2, inherent in the meaning of the word translated <i>atoning sacrifice </i>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7985;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#956;&#972;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Jilasmos</font>) is the idea of turning away the divine wrath, so that &#8220;propitiation&#8221; is the closest English equivalent. God&#8217;s love for us is expressed in his sending his Son to be the propitiation (the propitiatory sacrifice) for our sins on the cross. This is an indirect way for the author to allude to one of the main points of his controversy with the opponents: the significance for believers&#8217; salvation of Jesus&#8217; earthly life and ministry, including especially his sacrificial death on the cross. The contemporary English &#8220;atoning sacrifice&#8221; communicates this idea more effectively.</p>

The author made the same point already in 1 John 3:16. But this failure to show love for fellow believers is just what the opponents are doing: In 1 John 3:17 the author charged them with refusing to love their brothers by withholding needed material assistance. By their failure to love the brothers sacrificially according to the example Jesus set for believers, the opponents have demonstrated again the falsity of their claims to love God and know God (see 1 John 2:9).</p>

<A NAME="435"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=209><b>sn</b> The genitive <i>of his Spirit</i> here, like the phrase in 3:24, probably reflects a partitive nuance, so that the author portrays God as &#8216;apportioning&#8217; his Spirit to individual believers. This leads to the important observation that the author is not particularly interested in emphasizing (1) the ongoing <i>interior</i> witness of the Holy Spirit (which is what the passage is often understood to mean) but is emphasizing (2) the <i>fact</i> that God has given the Spirit to believers, and it is this fact that gives believers assurance of their relationship to God. In other words, it is the <i>fact</i> that the Holy Spirit has been given to believers, rather than the ongoing interior testimony of the Holy Spirit within the believer, which is the primary source of the believer&#8217;s assurance.</p>

They also occur together in one other context in 1 John, 4:1-2. Of these John 6:69, Peter&#8217;s confession, is the closest parallel to the usage here: &#8220;We have come to <i>believe</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#949;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#954;&#945;&#956;&#949;&#957;</font>] and to<i> know</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#947;&#957;&#8061;&#954;&#945;&#956;&#949;&#957;</font>] that you are the holy One of God.&#8221; Here the order between &#8220;knowing&#8221; and &#8220;believing&#8221; is reversed from 1 John 4:16, but an examination of the other examples from the Gospel of John should make it clear that there is no difference in meaning when the order of the terms is reversed. It appears that the author considered both terms to describe a single composite action. Thus they represent a hendiadys which describes an act of faith/belief/trust on the part of the individual; knowledge (true knowledge) is an inseparable part of this act of faith.</p>
<A NAME="440"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=214><b>tn</b> The force of the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">en</font>) in the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#7969;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">en Jhmin</font>) in 4:16a is disputed: Although (1) &#8220;for&#8221; (in the sense of &#8220;on behalf of&#8221;) is possible and is a common English translation, the other uses of the same phrase in 4:9 (where it refers to God&#8217;s love for us) and 4:12 (where it refers to God&#8217;s indwelling of the believer) suggest that (2) the author intends to emphasize <i>interiority</i> here &#8211; a reference to God&#8217;s love expressed <i>in</i> believers. This is confirmed by the only other uses in 1 John of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#967;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ecw</font>) with the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957;</font> (3:15 and 5:10) both of which literally mean something <i>in</i> someone.</p>

<A NAME="442"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=216><b>tn</b> The referent of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#8179;</font> (<font face="Greektl">en toutw</font>) here is more difficult to determine than most, because while there are both <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jina</font>) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joti</font>) clauses following, it is not clear whether or not they are related to the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#8179;</font>. There are actually three possibilities for the referent of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#8179;</font> in 4:17: (1) it may refer to the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</font> clause which immediately follows, so that the love of believers is brought to perfection <i>in that</i> they have confidence in the day of judgment. The main problem with this interpretation is that since the day of judgment is still future, it necessitates understanding the second use of the preposition &#8220;in&#8221; (second <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957;</font> [<font face="Greektl">en</font>]) to mean &#8220;about&#8221; or &#8220;concerning&#8221; with reference to the day of judgment in order to make logical sense. (2) The <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#8179;</font> may refer to the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause in 4:17b, meaning &#8220;love is perfected with us&#8230;<i>in that</i> just as he [Christ] is, so also are we in this world.&#8221; This makes logical sense, and there are numerous cases where <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#8179;</font> is explained by a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause that follows. However, according to this understanding the intervening <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</font> clause is awkward, and there is no other instance of the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#8179;</font> explained by a following <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause where a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</font> clause intervenes between the two in this way. (3) Thus, the third possibility is that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#8179;</font> refers to what <i>precedes</i> in 4:16b, and this also would make logical sense: &#8220;By this &#8211; by our residing in love so that we reside in God and he resides in us &#8211; is love brought to perfection with us.&#8221; This has the additional advantage of agreeing precisely with what the author has already said in 4:12: &#8220;If we love one another, God remains in us and his love is brought to perfection in us.&#8221; Thus option (3) is best, with the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#8179;</font> referring to what precedes in 4:16b, and the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</font> clause which follows indicates the <i>result</i> of this perfection of love in believers: In the future day of judgment they will have confidence. The <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause would then give the <i>reason</i> for such confidence in the day of judgment: because just as Jesus is, so also are believers in this world &#8211; they are already currently in relationship with God just as Jesus is.</p>

A reference to Christ is confirmed in this context because the author says that &#8220;just as he is, so also are we [believers] <i>in this world</i>&#8221; and since 3:2 indicated that believers are to be like God in the future (but are not yet), the only one believers can be like already in the present age is Jesus Christ.</p>
<A NAME="445"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=219><b>sn</b> The entire phrase <i>fear has to do with punishment</i> may be understood in two slightly different ways: (1) &#8220;fear has its own punishment&#8221; or (2) &#8220;fear has to do with [includes] punishment.&#8221; These are not far apart, however, and the real key to understanding the expression lies in the meaning of the word &#8220;punishment&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#972;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">kolasis</font>). While it may refer to torture or torment (BDAG 555 s.v. 1) there are numerous Koine references involving eternal punishment (2 Macc 4:38; <i>T. Reu.</i> 5:5; <i>T. Gad</i> 7:5) and this is also the use in the only other NT reference, Matt 25:46. In the present context, where the author has mentioned having <i>confidence in the day of judgment</i> (4:17), it seems virtually certain that eternal punishment (or fear of it) is what is meant here. The (only) alternative to perfected love, which results in confidence at the day of judgment, is fear, which has to do with the punishment one is afraid of receiving at the judgment. As 4:18b states, &#8220;<i>the one who fears [punishment] has not been perfected in love</i>.&#8221; It is often assumed by interpreters that the opposite to <i>perfected</i> love (which casts out fear) is <i>imperfect</i> love (which still has fear and therefore no assurance). This is possible, but it is not likely, because the author nowhere mentions &#8216;imperfect&#8217; love, and for him the opposite of &#8216;perfected&#8217; love appears to be not imperfect love but hate (cf. 4:20). In other words, in the antithetical (&#8216;either/or&#8217;) categories in which the author presents his arguments, one is either a genuine believer, who becomes &#8216;perfected&#8217; in love as he resides in love and in a mutually indwelling relationship with God (cf. 4:16b), <i>or</i> one is not a genuine believer at all, but one who (like the opponents) hates his brother, is a liar, and does not know God at all. This individual should well fear judgment and eternal punishment because in the author&#8217;s view that is precisely where such a person is headed.</p>
