The imagery in 1 John is that of the male parent who fathers children. See the note on &#8220;fathered&#8221; in 2:29 for further discussion of this imagery.</p>
<A NAME="510"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=232><b>tc</b> &#8225; Most witnesses ([<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>] A P 1739 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> sy) have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>, &#8220;also&#8221;) before the article <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#972;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ton</font>). But the external evidence for the shorter reading is significant (B <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 048<sup>vid<i> </i></sup>33 <i>pc </i>sa), and the conjunction looks to be a motivated reading in which scribes emulated the wording of 4:21 (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#947;&#945;&#960;&#8119; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#972;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">agapa kai ton</font>). NA<sup>27</sup> places the conjunction in brackets, indicating doubts as to its authenticity. </p>
<A NAME="511"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=233><b>sn</b> <i>Also loves the child fathered by him. </i>Is the meaning of 5:1b a general observation or a specific statement about God and Christians? There are three ways in which the second half of 5:1 has been understood: (1) as a general statement, proverbial in nature, applying to any parent: &#8220;everyone who loves the father also loves the child fathered by him.&#8221; (2) This has also been understood as a statement that is particularly true of one&#8217;s own parent: &#8220;everyone who loves his own father also loves the (other) children fathered by him (i.e., one&#8217;s own brothers and sisters).&#8221; (3) This could be understood as a statement which refers particularly to God, in light of the context (5:1a): &#8220;everyone who loves God who fathered Christians also loves the Christians who are fathered by God.&#8221; Without doubt options (2) and (3) are implications of the statement in its present context, but it seems most probable that the meaning of the statement is more general and proverbial in nature (option 1). This is likely because of the way in which it is introduced by the author with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#8118;&#962; &#8001;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pas Jo</font>) + participle. The author could have been more explicit and said something like, &#8220;everyone who loves God also loves God&#8217;s children&#8221; had he intended option (3) without ambiguity. Yet that, in context, is the ultimate <i>application</i> of the statement, because it ultimately refers to the true Christian who, because he loves God, also loves the brethren, those who are God&#8217;s offspring. This is the opposite of 4:20, where the author asserted that the opponents, who profess to love God but do not love the brethren, cannot really love God because they do not love the brethren.</p>
<A NAME="512"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=234><b>tn</b> Once more there is the familiar difficulty of determining whether the phrase refers (1) to what precedes or (2) to what follows. Here, because <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#8179;</font> (<font face="Greektl">en toutw</font>) is followed by a clause introduced by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#945;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jotan</font>) which appears to be related, it is best to understand <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#8179;</font> as referring to what follows. The following <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#945;&#957;</font> clause is epexegetical to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#8179;</font>, explaining <i>how</i> we know that we love God&#8217;s children: &#8220;by this we know that we love God&#8217;s children, whenever we love God and keep his commandments.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="513"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=235><b>tn</b> The force of the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#940;&#961;</font> (<font face="Greektl">gar</font>) at the beginning of 5:3 is similar to another introductory formula used by the author of 1 John, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#945;&#8021;&#964;&#951; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#943;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai Jauth estin</font>; used in 1:5; 5:4, 11, and 14). The <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#940;&#961;</font> draws an inference based on the preceding statements, particularly the one in 5:2b, regarding the love of God. If in 5:2 loving God and keeping his commandments is the key to knowing that we love God&#8217;s children, it is important to define what the love of God involves, and this is what the author is doing in 5:3. In fact, as the following <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jina</font>) clause makes clear, loving God consists in keeping his commandments.</p>
<A NAME="514"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=236><b>tn</b> Once again the genitive could be understood as (1) objective, (2) subjective, or (3) both. Here an objective sense is more likely (believers&#8217; love for God) because in the previous verse it is clear that God is the object of believers&#8217; love.</p>
<A NAME="515"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=237><b>tn</b> Contrary to the punctuation of NA<sup>27</sup> and UBS<sup>4</sup>, it is best to place a full stop (period) following <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#951;&#961;&#8182;&#956;&#949;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">thrwmen</font>) in 5:3. The subordinate clause introduced by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joti</font>) at the beginning of 5:4 is related to the second half of 5:3 which begins with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943; </font>(<font face="Greektl">kai</font>). <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#922;&#945;&#943;</font> is commonly used by the author to begin a new sentence, probably by analogy with the Hebrew <font face="Scholar">vav</font> consecutive.</p>
<A NAME="516"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=238><b>tn</b> The explicit reason the commandments of God are not burdensome to the believer is given by the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joti</font>) clause at the beginning of 5:4. It is because &#8220;everyone who is begotten by God conquers the world.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="517"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=239><b>tn</b> The masculine might have been expected here rather than the neuter <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#8118;&#957; &#964;&#8056; &#947;&#949;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#957;&#951;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#7952;&#954; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pan to gegennhmenon ek tou qeou</font>) to refer to the person who is fathered by God. However, BDF §138.1 explains that &#8220;the neuter is sometimes used with respect to persons if it is not the individuals but a generic quality that is to be emphasized&#8221;; this seems to be the case here, where a collective aspect is in view: As a group, all those who have been begotten by God, that is, all true believers, overcome the world.</p>
<A NAME="518"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=240><b>sn</b> The author is once more looking at the situation antithetically (in &#8216;either/or&#8217; terms) as he sees the readers on the one hand as true believers (<i>everyone who is fathered by God</i>) who have overcome the world through their faith, and the opponents on the other as those who have claimed to have a relationship with God but really do not; they belong to the world in spite of their claims.</p>
<A NAME="519"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=241><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;overcomes.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="520"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=242><b>sn</b> <i>Conquers the world. </i>Once again, the author&#8217;s language is far from clear at this point, and so is his meaning, but the author has used the verb <i>conquers</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#957;&#953;&#954;&#940;&#969;</font>, <font face="Greektl">nikaw</font>) previously to describe the believer&#8217;s victory over the enemy, the evil one himself, in 2:13-14, and over the secessionist opponents, described as &#8220;false prophets&#8221; in 4:4. This suggests that what the author has in mind here is a victory over the opponents, who now belong to the <i>world</i> and speak its language (cf. 4:5). In the face of the opponents&#8217; attempts through their false teaching to confuse the readers (true believers) about who it is they are supposed to love, the author assures the readers that loving God and keeping his commandments assures us that we really do love God&#8217;s children, and because we have already achieved victory over the world through our faith, keeping God&#8217;s commandments is not a difficult matter.</p>
<A NAME="521"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=243><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And this.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="522"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=244><b>tn</b> The standard English translation for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969; &#957;&#943;&#954;&#951;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jh nikh</font>) is &#8220;victory&#8221; (BDAG 673 s.v.) but this does not preserve the relationship with the cognate verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#957;&#953;&#954;&#940;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">nikaw</font>; used in 2:13,14 and present in this context in participial form in 5:4b and 5:5). One alternative would be &#8220;conquest,&#8221; although R. E. Brown (<i>Epistles of John</i> [AB], 570) suggests &#8220;conquering power&#8221; as a translation for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969; &#957;&#943;&#954;&#951;</font> since here it is a metonymy for the means of victory or the power that gives victory, referring to believers&#8217; faith.</p>
<A NAME="523"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=245><b>tn</b> The use of the aorist participle (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969; &#957;&#953;&#954;&#8053;&#963;&#945;&#963;&#945;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Jh nikhsasa</font>) to refer to faith as the conquering power that &#8220;has conquered the world&#8221; in 5:4b is problematic. Debate here centers over the temporal value of the aorist participle: (1) It may indicate an action contemporaneous with the (present tense) main verb, in which case the alternation between aorist participle in 5:4b and present participle in 5:5 is one more example of the author&#8217;s love of stylistic variation with no difference in meaning. (2) Nevertheless, an aorist participle with a present tense main verb would normally indicate an action antecedent to that of the main verb, so that the aorist participle would describe a past action. That is the most probable here. Thus the aorist participle stresses that the conquest of the world is something that has already been accomplished.</p>
<A NAME="524"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=246><b>tn</b> After a verb of perception (the participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#969;&#957; </font>[<font face="Greektl">Jo pisteuwn</font>]) the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joti</font>) in 5:5 introduces indirect discourse, a declarative or recitative clause giving the <i>content</i> of what the person named by the participle (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#969;&#957;</font>) believes: &#8220;that Jesus is the Son of God.&#8221; As in 4:15, such a confession constitutes a problem for the author&#8217;s opponents but not for his readers who are genuine believers.</p>
<A NAME="525"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=247><b>tn</b> This <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joti</font>) is best understood (1) as causal. Some have taken it (2) as declarative, giving the <i>content</i> of the Spirit&#8217;s testimony: &#8220;and the Spirit is the One who testifies that the Spirit is the truth.&#8221; This is certainly possible, since a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause following the cognate verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#965;&#961;&#941;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">marturevw</font>) often gives the content of the testimony (cf. John 1:34; 3:28; 4:39, 44). But in the Gospel of John the Spirit never bears witness on his own behalf, but always on behalf of Jesus (John 15:26, 16:13). There are, in fact, some instances in the Gospel of John where a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause following <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#965;&#961;&#941;&#969;</font> is <i>causal</i> (8:14, 15:27), and that is more likely here: &#8220;and the Spirit is the One who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="526"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=248><b>tn</b> A second causal <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joti</font>) clause (after the one at the end of the preceding verse) is somewhat awkward, especially since the reasons offered in each are somewhat different. The content of the second <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause (the one in question here) goes somewhat beyond the content of the first. The first <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause, the one at the end of 5:6, stated the <i>reason</i> why the Spirit is the witness: because the Spirit is the truth. The second <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause, here, states that there are three witnesses, of which the Spirit is one. It is probably best, therefore, to understand this second <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> as indicating a somewhat looser connection than the first, not strictly causal but inferential in sense (the English translation &#8220;for&#8221; captures this inferential sense). See BDF §456.1 for a discussion of this &#8216;looser&#8217; use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font>.</p>

This reading, the infamous <i>Comma Johanneum</i>, has been known in the English-speaking world through the King James translation. However, the evidence &#8211; both external and internal &#8211; is decidedly against its authenticity. For a detailed discussion, see <i>TCGNT</i> 647-49. Our discussion will briefly address the external evidence. This longer reading is found only in nine late <sc>mss, four of which have the words in a marginal note. Most of these <sc>mss (221 2318 [18th century] {2473 [dated 1634]} and [with minor variations] 61 88 429 629 636 918) originate from the 16th century; the earliest ms, codex 221 (10th century) includes the reading in a marginal note, added sometime after the original composition. The oldest ms with the <i>Comma</i> in its <i>text</i> is from the 14th century (629), but the wording here departs from all the other <sc>mss in several places. The next oldest <sc>mss on behalf of the <i>Comma</i>, 88 (12th century) 429 (14th) 636 (15th), also have the reading only as a marginal note (<i>v.l.</i>). The remaining <sc>mss are from the 16th to 18th centuries. Thus, there is no sure evidence of this reading in any Greek ms until the 14th century (629), and that ms deviates from all others in its wording; the wording that matches what is found in the <i>TR </i>was apparently composed after Erasmus&#8217; Greek NT was published in 1516. Indeed, the <i>Comma</i> appears in no Greek witness of any kind (either ms, patristic, or Greek translation of some other version) until <sc>a.d. 1215 (in a Greek translation of the Acts of the Lateran Council, a work originally written in Latin). This is all the more significant since many a Greek Father would have loved such a reading, for it so succinctly affirms the doctrine of the Trinity. The reading seems to have arisen in a 4th century Latin homily in which the text was allegorized to refer to members of the Trinity. From there, it made its way into copies of the Latin Vulgate, the text used by the Roman Catholic Church. The Trinitarian formula (known as the <i>Comma Johanneum</i>) made its way into the third edition of Erasmus&#8217; Greek NT (1522) because of pressure from the Catholic Church. After his first edition appeared, there arose such a furor over the absence of the <i>Comma</i> that Erasmus needed to defend himself. He argued that he did not put in the <i>Comma</i> because he found no Greek <sc>mss that included it. Once one was produced (codex 61, written in ca. 1520), Erasmus apparently felt obliged to include the reading. He became aware of this ms sometime between May of 1520 and September of 1521. In his annotations to his third edition he does not protest the rendering now in his text, as though it were made to order; but he does defend himself from the charge of indolence, noting that he had taken care to find whatever <sc>mss he could for the production of his text. In the final analysis, Erasmus probably altered the text because of politico-theologico-economic concerns: He did not want his reputation ruined, nor his <i>Novum Instrumentum </i>to go unsold. Modern advocates of the <i>TR</i> and KJV generally argue for the inclusion of the <i>Comma Johanneum</i> on the basis of heretical motivation by scribes who did not include it. But these same scribes elsewhere include thoroughly orthodox readings &#8211; even in places where the <i>TR</i>/Byzantine <sc>mss lack them. Further, these advocates argue theologically from the position of divine preservation: Since this verse is in the <i>TR</i>, it must be original. (Of course, this approach is circular, presupposing as it does that the <i>TR</i> = the original text.) In reality, the issue is history, not heresy: How can one argue that the <i>Comma Johanneum</i> goes back to the original text yet does not appear until the 14th century in any Greek <sc>mss (and that form is significantly different from what is printed in the <i>TR</i>; the wording of the <i>TR </i>is not found in any Greek <sc>mss until the 16th century)? Such a stance does not do justice to the gospel: Faith must be rooted in history. Significantly, the German translation of Luther was based on Erasmus&#8217; second edition (1519) and lacked the <i>Comma.</i> But the KJV translators, basing their work principally on Theodore Beza&#8217;s 10th edition of the Greek NT (1598), a work which itself was fundamentally based on Erasmus&#8217; third and later editions (and Stephanus&#8217; editions), popularized the <i>Comma</i> for the English-speaking world. Thus, the <i>Comma Johanneum</i> has been a battleground for English-speaking Christians more than for others.</p>

<A NAME="529"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=251><b>tn</b> The problem with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8021;&#964;&#951;</font> (<font face="Greektl">jJauth</font>) in 5:9 lies in determining whether it refers (1) to what precedes or (2) to what follows.

In all of the other instances of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8021;&#964;&#951; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">{auth estin</font>, 1:5; 3:11, 23) the phrase is followed by an epexegetical (explanatory) clause giving the referent (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> [<font face="Greektl">Joti</font>] in 1:5, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</font> [<font face="Greektl">Jina</font>] in 3:11 and 23). The <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause which follows the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8021;&#964;&#951;</font> in 5:9 does <i>not</i> explain the testimony, but should be understood as an adjectival relative clause which qualifies the testimony further. The <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause which explains the testimony of 5:9 (to which the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8021;&#964;&#951;</font> in 5:9 refers) is found in 5:11, where the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8021;&#964;&#951; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;</font> is repeated. Thus the second use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8021;&#964;&#951; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;</font> in 5:11 is <i>resumptive</i>, and the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause which follows the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8021;&#964;&#951;</font> in 5:11 is the epexegetical (explanatory) clause which explains both it and the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8021;&#964;&#951;</font> in 5:9 which it resumes.</p>
<A NAME="530"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=252><b>tn</b> The second <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joti</font>) in 5:9 may be understood in three different ways. (1) It may be causal, in which case it gives the <i>reason</i> why the testimony just mentioned is God&#8217;s testimony: &#8220;because he has testified concerning his Son.&#8221; This is extremely awkward because of the preceding <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause which is almost certainly causal (although the second <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> could perhaps be resumptive in force, continuing the first). (2) The second <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> could be understood as epexegetical (explanatory), in which case it explains <i>what</i> the testimony of God mentioned in the preceding clause consists of: &#8220;because this is the testimony of God, [namely,] that he has testified concerning his Son.&#8221; This is much smoother grammatically, but encounters the logical problem that &#8220;the testimony of God&#8221; is defined in 5:11 (&#8220;And this is the testimony: that God has given us eternal life&#8221;) and the two definitions of what the testimony of God consists of are not identical (some would say that they are not even close). Thus (3) the smoothest way to understand the second <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> logically is to read it as a relative pronoun: &#8220;because this is the testimony of God <i>that</i> he has testified concerning his Son.&#8221; In this case it is exactly parallel to the relative clause which occurs in 5:10b: &#8220;because he has not believed the testimony <i>that</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7971;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Jhn</font>) God has testified concerning his Son.&#8221; (There is in fact a textual problem with the second <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> in 5:9: The Byzantine tradition, along with ms P, reads a relative pronoun [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7971;&#957;</font>] in place of the second <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> in 5:9 identical to the relative pronoun in 5:10b. This represents an obvious effort on the part of scribes to smooth out the reading of the text.) In an effort to derive a similar sense from the second <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> in 5:9 it has been suggested that the conjunction <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> should be read as an indefinite relative pronoun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> (sometimes written <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005; &#964;&#953;</font>). The problem with this suggestion is the use of the neuter relative pronoun to refer to a feminine antecedent (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969; &#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#965;&#961;&#943;&#945;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Jh marturia</font>). It is not without precedent for a neuter relative pronoun to refer to an antecedent of differing gender, especially as some forms tended to become fixed in usage and were used without regard to agreement. But in this particular context it is difficult to see why the author would use a neuter indefinite relative pronoun here in 5:9b and then use the normal feminine relative pronoun (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7971;&#957;</font>) in the next verse. (Perhaps this strains at the limits of even the notorious Johannine preference for stylistic variation, although it is impossible to say what the author might or might not have been capable of doing.) Because of the simplicity and logical smoothness which results from reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> as equivalent to a relative pronoun, the third option is preferred, although it is not without its difficulties (as are all three options).</p>

It is not the reality of eternal life (whether it exists at all or not) that is being debated here, but rather which side in the debate (the author and his readers or the opponents) possesses it (this is a key point). The letter began with a testimony that &#8220;the eternal life&#8221; has been revealed (1:2), and it is consummated here with the reception or acknowledgment of that eternal life as the final testimony. This testimony (which is God&#8217;s testimony) consists in eternal life itself, which the author and the readers possess, but the opponents do not. This, for the author, constitutes the final apologetic in his case against the opponents.</p>

From the parallel statement in 5:10a it is clear that believing in the Son and thus having God&#8217;s testimony in one&#8217;s self is the same as &#8220;having&#8221; the Son here in 5:12a. This is essentially identical to John 3:16: &#8220;that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.&#8221; In contrast, the negative statement in 5:12b reflects the author&#8217;s evaluation of the opponents: &#8220;the one who does not have the Son does not have (eternal) life.&#8221; The opponents, in spite of their claims to know God, do not possess (nor have they at any time possessed, cf. 2:19) eternal life.</p>

<A NAME="549"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=271><b>tn</b> The referent of the (understood) third person subject of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#8061;&#963;&#949;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">dwsei</font>) in 5:16 is difficult to determine. Once again the author&#8217;s meaning is obscure. Several possibilities have been suggested for the referent of the subject of this verb: (1) From a grammatical and syntactical standpoint, it would be easiest to understand the subject of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#8061;&#963;&#949;&#953;</font> in 5:16 as the person who makes the request, since this person is the subject of the preceding verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#7984;&#964;&#8053;&#963;&#949;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">aithsei</font>) and the following verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#961;&#969;&#964;&#8053;&#963;&#8131;</font> (<font face="Greektl">erwthsh</font>). From a theological standpoint this is extremely difficult, however, since it would make the person who prays for the sinner the giver of life, and it is questionable whether the author (for whom God is the ultimate source of life) would say that one believer could &#8216;give&#8217; life to another. In this case the meaning would be: &#8220;he [the petitioner] should ask, and he [the petitioner] will grant life to him [the sinner], namely, to those who sin not to death.&#8221; (2) Another option is to see God as the subject of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#8061;&#963;&#949;&#953;</font> in 5:16 and the Giver of life to the sinner. This is far more consistent theologically with the author&#8217;s perspective on God as the Giver of life everywhere else, but it is awkward grammatically (as explained in reference to the previous position above) because it involves a shift in subjects for the three third-person verbs in the context from the person who makes the request (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#7984;&#964;&#8053;&#963;&#949;&#953;</font>) to God (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#8061;&#963;&#949;&#953;</font>) and back to the person who makes the request (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#961;&#969;&#964;&#8053;&#963;&#8131;</font>). In this case the meaning would be: &#8220;he [the petitioner] should ask, and he [God] will grant life to him [the sinner], namely, to those who sin not to death.&#8221; (3) A third possibility is to see God as the subject of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#8061;&#963;&#949;&#953;</font> in 5:16, but the person who makes the request (rather than the sinner) as the referent of the indirect object <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183;</font> (<font face="Greektl">autw</font>) in 5:16. This is possible because the indirect object <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183;</font> is singular, while the dative substantival participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#7937;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#940;&#957;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">toi&quot; Jamartanousin</font>) which follows (which clearly refers to those who sin) is plural. Thus the meaning would be: &#8220;he [the petitioner] should ask, and he [God] will grant life to him [the petitioner], with reference to [his praying for] those who sin not to death.&#8221; Although this is a difficult and awkward construction no matter what solution one takes, on the whole the second alternative seems most probable. Even if option (1) is preferred it must be acknowledged that God is ultimately the source of life, although it is given as a result of the petitioner&#8217;s intercessory prayer and the petitioner becomes, in a sense, the intermediate agent. But in the preceding context (5:11) the author has emphasized that God is the Giver of life, and in spite of the awkwardness in the change of subjects, that would seem to be the most likely meaning here, so option (2) is preferred. Option (3) is improbable because it seems clear that it should be the sinner for whom intercession is made, rather than the petitioner, who is the recipient of life. The petitioner would be assumed to possess life already or he could not be making a request which God would hear. In this case the change from the singular dative indirect object (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183;</font>) to the plural dative substantival participle (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#7937;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#940;&#957;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#957;</font>) is merely a loose construction (which by this time should come as no surprise from the author).</p>

Here, having implied that sins committed by believers (sins &#8220;not to death&#8221;) may be prayed for and forgiven, the author does not want to leave the impression that such sin is insignificant, because this could be viewed as a concession to the views of the opponents (who as moral indifferentists have downplayed the significance of sin in the Christian&#8217;s life).</p>

<A NAME="556"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=278><b>tn</b> The meaning of the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#947;&#949;&#957;&#957;&#951;&#952;&#949;&#8054;&#962; &#7952;&#954; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166; &#964;&#951;&#961;&#949;&#8150; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#972;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jo gennhqeis ek tou qeou threi auton</font>) in 5:18 is extraordinarily difficult. Again the author&#8217;s capacity for making obscure statements results in several possible meanings for this phrase: (1) &#8220;The fathering by God protects him [the Christian].&#8221; Here a textual variant for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#947;&#949;&#957;&#957;&#951;&#952;&#949;&#943;&#962;</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969; &#947;&#941;&#957;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Jh gennhsi&quot;</font>) has suggested to some that the passive participle should be understood as a noun (&#8220;fathering&#8221; or perhaps &#8220;birth&#8221;), but the ms evidence is extremely slight (1505 1852 2138 latt [sy<sup>h</sup>] bo). This almost certainly represents a scribal attempt to clarify an obscure phrase. (2) &#8220;The One fathered by God [Jesus] protects him [the Christian].&#8221; This is a popular interpretation, and is certainly possible grammatically. Yet the introduction of a reference to Jesus in this context is sudden; to be unambiguous the author could have mentioned the &#8220;Son of God&#8221; here, or used the pronoun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954;&#949;&#8150;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ekeinos</font>) as a reference to Jesus as he consistently does elsewhere in 1 John. This interpretation, while possible, seems in context highly unlikely. (3) &#8220;The one fathered by God [the Christian] protects himself.&#8221; Again a textual problem is behind this alternative, since a number of <sc>mss (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A<sup>c</sup> P <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 33 1739 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>) supply the reflexive pronoun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7953;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#972;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jeauton</font>) in place of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#972;&#957;</font> in 5:18. On the basis of the external evidence this has a good possibility of being the original reading, but internal evidence favors <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#972;&#957;</font> as the more difficult reading, since <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7953;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#972;&#957;</font> may be explained as a scribal attempt at grammatical smoothness. From a logical standpoint, however, it is difficult to make much more sense out of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7953;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#972;&#957;</font>; to say what &#8220;the Christian protects himself&#8221; means in the context is far from clear. (4) &#8220;The one fathered by God [the Christian] holds on to him [God].&#8221; This results in further awkwardness, because the third person pronoun (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</font>, <font face="Greektl">autou</font>) in the following clause must refer to the Christian, not God. Furthermore, although <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#951;&#961;&#941;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">threw</font>) can mean &#8220;hold on to&#8221; (BDAG 1002 s.v. 2.c), this is not a common meaning for the verb in Johannine usage, occurring elsewhere only in Rev 3:3. (5) &#8220;The one fathered by God [the Christian], he [God] protects him [the Christian].&#8221; This involves a <i>pendant nominative</i> construction (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#947;&#949;&#957;&#957;&#951;&#952;&#949;&#8054;&#962; &#7952;&#954; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font>) where a description of something within the clause is placed in the nominative case and moved forward ahead of the clause for emphatic reasons. This may be influenced by Semitic style; such a construction is also present in John 17:2 (&#8220;in order that <i>everyone</i> whom You have given to him, he may give <i>to them</i> eternal life&#8221;). This view is defended by K. Beyer (<i>Semitische Syntax im Neuen Testament</i> [SUNT], 1:216ff.) and appears to be the most probable in terms both of syntax and of sense. It makes God the protector of the Christian (rather than the Christian himself), which fits the context much better, and there is precedent in Johannine literature for such syntactical structure.</p>
<A NAME="557"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=279><b>tn</b> The preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ek</font>) here indicates both source and possession: Christians are &#8220;from&#8221; God in the sense that they are begotten by him, and they belong to him.

<A NAME="559"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=281><b>sn</b> The pronoun <i>This one</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8023;&#964;&#959;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Joutos</font>) refers to a person, but it is far from clear whether it should be understood as a reference (1) to God the Father or (2) to Jesus Christ. R. E. Brown (<i>Epistles of John </i>[AB], 625) comments, &#8220;I John, which began with an example of stunning grammatical obscurity in the prologue, continues to the end to offer us examples of unclear grammar.&#8221; The nearest previous antecedent is <i>Jesus Christ</i>, immediately preceding, but on some occasions when this has been true the pronoun still refers to God (see 1 John 2:3). The first predicate which follows <i>This one</i> in 5:20, <i>the true God</i>, is a description of God the Father used by Jesus in John 17:3, and was used in the preceding clause of the present verse to refer to God the Father (<i>him who is true</i>). Yet the second predicate of <i>This one</i> in 5:20, <i>eternal life</i>, appears to refer to Jesus, because although the Father possesses &#8220;life&#8221; (John 5:26, 6:57) just as Jesus does (John 1:4, 6:57, 1 John 5:11), &#8220;life&#8221; is <i>never</i> predicated of the Father elsewhere, while it is predicated of Jesus in John 11:25 and 14:6 (a self-predication by Jesus). If <i>This one</i> in 5:20 is understood as referring to Jesus, it forms an inclusion with the prologue, which introduced the reader to &#8220;the eternal <i>life</i> which was with the Father and was manifested to us.&#8221; Thus it appears best to understand the pronoun <i>This one</i> in 5:20 as a reference to Jesus Christ. The christological affirmation which results is striking, but certainly not beyond the capabilities of the author (see John 1:1 and 20:28): <i>This One [Jesus Christ] is the true God and eternal life</i>.</p>
