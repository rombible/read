<A NAME="355"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=148><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#941;&#957;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">menw</font>) in 3:15 refers to a spiritual reality (eternal life) which in this case does <i>not</i> reside in the person in question. To speak in terms of eternal life not &#8220;residing&#8221; in such an individual is not to imply that at some time in the past this person did possess eternal life and subsequently lost it, however. The previous verse (3:14) makes it clear that the individual under discussion here has &#8220;remained&#8221; in death (the realm of spiritual death) and so has <i>never</i> possessed eternal life to begin with, no matter what he may have claimed. Taken together with the use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#941;&#957;&#969;</font> in 3:14, the use here implies that the opponents have &#8220;remained&#8221; in death all along, and have not ever been genuine believers. Thus &#8220;residing&#8221; rather than &#8220;remaining&#8221; is used as the translation for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#945;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">menousan</font>) here.</p>
