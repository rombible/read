<A NAME="365"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=158><b>tn</b> Once again there is the problem of deciding whether the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#8179;</font> (<font face="Greektl">en toutw</font>) refers (1) to what precedes or (2) to what follows. When an explanatory or epexegetical <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joti</font>) clause follows, and the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause is not grammatically unrelated to the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#8179;</font>, then the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#8179;</font> is best understood as referring to what follows. Here in 3:19-20 there are no less than <i>three</i> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clauses that follow, one in 3:19 and two in 3:20, and thus there is the difficulty of trying to determine whether any one of them is related to the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#8179;</font> phrase in 3:19. It is relatively easy to eliminate the first <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause (in 3:19) from consideration, because it is related not to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#8179;</font> but to the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#957;&#969;&#963;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#952;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">gnwsomeqa</font>) as an indirect discourse clause giving the content of what believers know (&#8220;that we are of the truth&#8221;). As far as the two <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clauses in 3:20 are concerned, it is difficult to see how believers could know that they belong to the truth (19a) by means of either, since the first speaks of a situation where they are under self-condemnation (&#8220;if our heart condemns us&#8230;&#8221;) and the second <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause seems to give a further explanation related to the first (&#8220;that God is greater than our heart&#8230;&#8221;). Therefore it seems better to understand the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#8179;</font> in 3:19 as referring to the preceding context, and this makes perfectly good sense, because 3:18 concludes with a reference to the righteous deeds with which believers are to love one another, which are produced by the truth.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>By this </i>refers to the righteous deeds mentioned at the end of 3:18, the expressions of love. It is by doing these deeds that believers assure themselves that they belong to the truth, because the outward action reflects the inward reality of their relationship with God. Put another way, &#8216;conduct is the clue to paternity.&#8217;</p>
