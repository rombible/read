<A NAME="351"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=144><b>tn</b> See note on the phrase &#8220;fellow Christian&#8221; in 2:9.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Because we love our fellow Christians. </i>This echoes Jesus&#8217; words in John 13:35, where he states, &#8220;by this all men will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.&#8221; As in 1 John 2:3 and 5, obedience becomes the basis for assurance. But the relationship between loving one&#8217;s fellow Christian (<i>Grk </i>&#8220;brother&#8221;) and possessing eternal life goes <i>beyond</i> a proof or external test. Our love for our fellow Christians is in fact a form of God&#8217;s love for us because as far as the author of 1 John is concerned, <i>all love comes from God</i> (cf. 4:7-11). Therefore he can add the next line of 3:14, &#8220;the one who does not love remains in death.&#8221; Why? Because such a person does not have God&#8217;s love residing in them at all. Rather, this person can be described as a &#8220;murderer&#8221; &#8211; as the following verse goes on to do. Note also that the author&#8217;s description here of the person who does not love as remaining in death is another way of describing a person who remains in darkness, which is a description of unbelievers in John 12:46. This provides further confirmation of the spiritual state of the author&#8217;s opponents in 2:9-11.</p>
