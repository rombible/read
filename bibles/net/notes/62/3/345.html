<A NAME="345"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=138><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;brothers,&#8221; but the Greek word may be used for &#8220;brothers and sisters&#8221; or &#8220;fellow Christians&#8221; as here (cf. BDAG 18 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#972;&#962;</font> 1, where considerable nonbiblical evidence for the plural <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#959;&#943;</font> [<font face="Greektl">adelfoi</font>] meaning &#8220;brothers and sisters&#8221; is cited). Since the author is addressing his readers directly at this point, &#8220;brothers and sisters&#8221; (suggesting a degree of familial endearment) has been employed in the translation at this point, while elsewhere the less direct &#8220;fellow Christians&#8221; has been used (cf. v. 14).</p>
