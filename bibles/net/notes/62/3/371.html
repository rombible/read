<A NAME="371"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=164><b>tn</b> The use of two <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joti</font>) clauses in close succession is somewhat awkward, but this is nothing new for the author; and indeed he has <i>twice</i> previously used two <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clauses in close proximity in 3:2 and 14. In both those instances the second <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> was understood as causal, and (1) some interpreters would do the same here. Unless one understands <i>both</i> of the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clauses in 3:20 as causal, however (an option rejected based on the analogy with 5:14, see the discussion in the note on &#8220;that&#8221; at the beginning of the present verse), the first <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause must be understood as parenthetical in order for the second to be causal. This results in an even more awkward construction. It seems most probable that (2) the second <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause in 3:20 should also be understood as epexegetical (explanatory), and resumptive to the first. The resultant meaning is as follows: &#8220;and we convince our heart before him, <i>that</i> if our heart condemns us, <i>that</i> God is greater than our heart and knows all things.&#8221;</p>
