It seems best to regard this as a case of asyndeton, although the Byzantine text, the Syriac Peshitta, the Bohairic Coptic, and some <sc>mss of the Sahidic Coptic supply <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> (<font face="Greektl">de</font>) after <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#7988;&#948;&#945;&#956;&#949;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">oidamen</font>) in 3:2b. This addition is not likely to be original, but it does reflect a tendency among scribes to see an adversative (contrastive) relationship between 3:2a and 3:2b. This seems to be an accurate understanding of the relationship between the clauses from a logical standpoint: &#8220;and what we shall be has not yet been revealed; <i>but</i> we know that whenever he should be revealed, we shall be like him.&#8221; </p>
