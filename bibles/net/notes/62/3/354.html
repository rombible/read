<A NAME="354"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=147><b>sn</b> <i>Everyone who hates his fellow Christian is a murderer. </i>On one level it is easy to see how the author could say this; the person who hates his brother is one and the same with the person who murders his brother. Behind the usage here, however, is John 8:44, the only other occurrence of the Greek word translated <i>murderer</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#964;&#972;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">anqrwpoktonos</font>) in the NT, where the devil is described as a &#8220;murderer from the beginning.&#8221; John 8:44 refers to the devil&#8217;s role in bringing death to Adam and Eve, but even more to his involvement (not directly mentioned in the Genesis account, but elaborated in the intertestamental literature, especially the writings of Philo) in Cain&#8217;s murder of his brother Abel. This was the first incident of murder in human history and also the first outward demonstration of the full implications of sin&#8217;s entry into the world. Ultimately, then, the devil is behind murder, just as he was behind Cain&#8217;s murder of Abel. When the hater kills, he shows himself to be a child of the devil (cf. 1 John 3:10). Once again, conduct is the clue to paternity.</p>
