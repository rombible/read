<A NAME="319"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=112><b>sn</b> The Greek word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#943;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anomia</font>) is often translated &#8220;iniquity&#8221; or &#8220;lawlessness&#8221; and in the LXX refers particularly to transgression of the law of Moses. In Jewish thought the ideas of sin (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7937;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#943;&#945;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Jamartia</font>) and lawlessness or iniquity (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#943;&#945;</font>) were often equated because sin involved a violation of the Mosaic law and hence lawlessness. For example, Ps 51:5 LXX sets the two in parallel, and Paul in Rom 4:7 (quoting Ps 32:1) does the same. For the author, it is not violation of the Mosaic law that results in lawlessness, since he is writing to Christians. The &#8216;law&#8217; for the author is the law of love, as given by Jesus in the new commandment of John 13:34-35. This is the command to love one&#8217;s brother, a major theme of 1 John and the one specific sin in the entire letter which the opponents are charged with (3:17). Since the author has already labeled the opponents &#8220;antichrists&#8221; in 2:18, it may well be that he sees in their iniquitous behavior of withdrawing from the community and refusing to love the brethren a foreshadowing of the apocalyptic iniquity of the end times (cf. 2 Thess 2:3-8). In Matt 24:11-12 Jesus foretold that false prophets would arise in the end times (cf. 1 John 4:1), that lawlessness (<font face="Greektl">anomia</font>) would increase, and that &#8220;the love of many will grow cold&#8221; (which would certainly fit the author&#8217;s portrait of the opponents here).</p>
