<A NAME="348"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=141><b>tn</b> This verb essentially means &#8220;to transfer from one place to another, <i>go/pass over</i>,&#8221; according to BDAG 638 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#946;&#945;&#943;&#957;&#969;</font> 1.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> In John 13:1 the same Greek verb translated <i>crossed over</i> here is used to refer to Jesus&#8217; departure from this world as he returns to the Father. Here it is used figuratively to refer to the believer&#8217;s transfer from the state of (spiritual) death to the state of (spiritual) life. This use is paralleled in John 5:24, where Jesus states, &#8220;the person who hears my message and believes the one who sent me has eternal life and will not be condemned, but has <i>crossed over</i> (same verb) from death to life.&#8221;</p>
