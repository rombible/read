<A NAME="317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=110><b>sn</b> <i>1 John 3:1-3. </i>All of 3:1-3 is a parenthesis within the present section in which the author reflects on what it means to be fathered by God, a subject he has mentioned at the end of 2:29. The sequence of the argument is then resumed by 3:4, which is in opposition to 2:29.</p>
