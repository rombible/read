<A NAME="324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=117><b>tn</b> The interpretive problem raised by the use of the present tense <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7937;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#940;&#957;&#949;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jamartanei</font>) in this verse (and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#959;&#953;&#949;&#8150;</font> [<font face="Greektl">poiei</font>] in 3:9 as well) is that (a) it appears to teach a sinless state of perfection for the true Christian, and (b) it appears to contradict the author&#8217;s own statements in 2:1-2 where he acknowledged that Christians do indeed sin. (1) One widely used method of reconciling the acknowledgment in 2:1-2 that Christians do sin with the statements in 3:6 and 3:9 that they do not is expressed by M. Zerwick (<i>Biblical Greek</i> §251). He understands the aorist to mean &#8220;commit sin in the concrete, commit some sin or other&#8221; while the present means &#8220;be a sinner, as a characteristic «state».&#8221; N. Turner (<i>Grammatical Insights</i>, 151) argues essentially the same as Zerwick, stating that the present tense <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7937;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#940;&#957;&#949;&#953;</font> is stative (be a sinner) while the aorist is ingressive (begin to be a sinner, as the initial step of committing this or that sin). Similar interpretations can be found in a number of grammatical works and commentaries. (2) Others, however, have questioned the view that the distinction in tenses alone can convey a &#8220;habitual&#8221; meaning without further contextual clarification, including C. H. Dodd (<i>The Johannine Epistles</i> [MNTC], 79) and Z. C. Hodges (&#8220;1 John,&#8221; <i>BKCNT</i>, 894). B. Fanning (<i>Verbal Aspect</i> [OTM], 215-17) has concluded that the habitual meaning for the present tense cannot be ruled out, because there are clear instances of habitual presents in the NT where other clarifying words are not present and the habitual sense is derived from the context alone. This means that from a grammatical standpoint alone, the habitual present cannot be ruled out in 1 John 3:6 and 9. It is still true, however, that it would have been much clearer if the author had reinforced the habitual sense with clarifying words or phrases in 1 John 3:6 and 9 if that is what he had intended. Dodd&#8217;s point, that reliance on the distinction in tenses alone is quite a subtle way of communicating such a vital point in the author&#8217;s argument, is still valid. It may also be added that the author of 1 John has demonstrated a propensity for alternating between present and aorist tenses for purely stylistic reasons (see 2:12).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Does not sin. </i>It is best to view the distinction between &#8220;everyone who practices sin&#8221; in 3:4 and &#8220;everyone who resides in him&#8221; in 3:6 as absolute and sharply in contrast. The author is here making a clear distinction between the opponents, who as moral indifferentists downplay the significance of sin in the life of the Christian, and the readers, who as true Christians recognize the significance of sin because Jesus came to take it away (3:5) and to destroy it as a work of the devil (3:8). This argument is developed more fully by S. Kubo (&#8220;I John 3:9: Absolute or Habitual?&#8221; <i>AUSS </i>7 [1969]: 47-56), who takes the opponents as Gnostics who define sin as ignorance. The opponents were probably not adherents of fully developed gnosticism, but Kubo is right that <i>the distinction between their position and that of the true Christian is intentionally portrayed by the author here as a sharp antithesis</i>. This explanation still has to deal with the contradiction between 2:1-2 and 3:6-9, but this does not present an insuperable difficulty. The author of 1 John has repeatedly demonstrated a tendency to present his ideas antithetically, in &#8220;either/or&#8221; terms, in order to bring out for the readers the drastic contrast between themselves as true believers and the opponents as false believers. In 2:1-2 the author can acknowledge the possibility that a true Christian might on occasion sin, because in this context he wishes to reassure his readers that the statements he has made about the opponents in the preceding context do not apply to them. But in 3:4-10, his concern is to bring out the absolute difference between the opponents and his readers, so he speaks in theoretical rather than practical terms which do not discuss the possible occasional exception, because to do so would weaken his argument.</p>
