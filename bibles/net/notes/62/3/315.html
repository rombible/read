<A NAME="315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=108><b>sn</b> The verb translated <i>purifies</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7937;&#947;&#957;&#943;&#950;&#969;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Jagnizw</font>) is somewhat unusual here, since it is not common in the NT, and occurs only once in the Gospel of John (11:55). One might wonder why the author did not use the more common verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7937;&#947;&#953;&#940;&#950;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jagiazw</font>), as in John 17:19, where Jesus prays, &#8220;On their behalf I consecrate myself, so that they may also be consecrated in the truth.&#8221; It is possible that there is some overlap between the two verbs and thus this is another example of Johannine stylistic variation, but the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7937;&#947;&#957;&#943;&#950;&#969;</font> is used in the context of John 11:55, which describes ritual purification for the Passover, a usage also found in the LXX (Exod 19:10-11, Num 8:21). In this context the use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7937;&#947;&#957;&#943;&#950;&#969;</font> would remind the readers that, if they have the future hope of entering the Father&#8217;s presence (&#8220;seeing him as he is&#8221; in 3:2), they need to prepare themselves by living a purified lifestyle now, just as Jesus lived during his earthly life and ministry (cf. 2:6 again). This serves to rebut the opponents&#8217; claims to moral indifference, that what the Christian does in the present life is of no consequence.</p>
