<A NAME="327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=120><b>sn</b> <i>The person who practices sin is of the devil. </i>1 John 3:10 and John 8:44 might be cited as parallels, because these speak of opponents as the devil&#8217;s &#8220;children.&#8221; However, it is significant that the author of 1 John never speaks of the opponents as &#8220;fathered by the devil&#8221; in the same sense as Christians are &#8220;fathered by God&#8221; (3:9). A concept of evildoers as &#8220;fathered&#8221; by the devil in the same sense as Christians are fathered by God would imply a much more fully developed Gnosticism with its dualistic approach to humanity. The author of 1 John carefully avoids saying that the opponents are &#8220;fathered by the devil,&#8221; because in Johannine theology not to be fathered by God is to be fathered only by the flesh (John 1:13). This is a significant piece of evidence that 1 John predates the more fully developed Gnosticism of the 2nd century. What the author <i>does</i> say is that the opponents (&#8220;the one who practices sin&#8221;) are <i>from</i> the devil, in the sense that they belong to him and have given him their allegiance.</p>
