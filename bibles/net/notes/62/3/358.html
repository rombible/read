<A NAME="358"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=151><b>sn</b> References to the fact that Jesus <i>laid down his life</i> using the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#943;&#952;&#951;&#956;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">tiqhmi</font>) are unique to the Gospel of John (10:11, 15, 17, 18; 13:37, 38; 15:13) and 1 John (only here). From John&#8217;s perspective Jesus&#8217; act in giving up his life sacrificially was a voluntary one; Jesus was always completely in control of the situation surrounding his arrest, trials, and crucifixion (see John 10:18). There is a parallel with 1 John 2:6 &#8211; there, as here, the life of Jesus (during his earthly ministry) becomes the <i>example</i> for believers to follow. This in turn underscores the importance of Jesus&#8217; earthly life and ministry (especially his sacrificial death on the cross), a point of contention between the author and his opponents in 1 John. See 1 John 4:10 for a further parallel.</p>
