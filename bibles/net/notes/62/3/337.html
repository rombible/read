<A NAME="337"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=130><b>tn</b> Once again there is the problem (by now familiar to the interpreter of 1 John) of determining whether the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#8179;</font> (<font face="Greektl">en toutw</font>) in 3:10 refers (1) to what precedes or (2) to what follows. If it refers to what precedes, it serves to conclude the unit which began with 2:28. The remainder of 3:10 would then form a transition to the following material (another &#8220;hinge&#8221; passage). On the other hand, if the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#8179;</font> refers to what follows, then the entirety of 3:10 is a summary statement at the end of 2:28-3:10 which recapitulates the section&#8217;s major theme (<i>conduct is the clue to paternity</i>), and provides at the same time a transition to the theme of <i>loving one&#8217;s brother</i> which will dominate the following section (3:11-24). Although R. E. Brown (<i>Epistles of John</i> [AB], 416) prefers to see the phrase as referring to the preceding material, it makes better sense to refer it to the remainder of 3:10 that follows, and see the entirety of 3:10 as both a summary of the theme of the preceding section 2:28-3:10 and a transition to the following section 3:11-24.</p>
