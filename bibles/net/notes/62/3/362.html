<A NAME="362"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=155><b>sn</b> Once again the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#941;&#957;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">menw</font>) is used of a spiritual reality (in this case the love of God) which does or does not <i>reside</i> in a person. Although the author uses the indefinite relative <i>whoever</i> (<i>Grk </i><font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8003;&#962; &#948;&#8127; &#7940;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Jos d</font>&#8217;<font face="Greektl"> an</font>), it is clear that he has the opponents in view here. This is the only specific moral fault he ever charges the opponents with in the entire letter. It is also clear that the author sees it as impossible that such a person, who refuses to offer help in his brother&#8217;s time of need (and thus &#8216;hates&#8217; his brother rather than &#8216;loving&#8217; him, cf. 3:15) can have any of the love which comes from God residing in him. This person, from the author&#8217;s dualistic &#8216;either/or&#8217; perspective, <i>cannot</i> be a believer. The semantic force of the deliberative rhetorical question, &#8220;How can the love of God reside in such a person?&#8221;, is therefore a declarative statement about the spiritual condition of the opponents: &#8220;The love of God cannot possibly reside in such a person.&#8221;</p>
