<A NAME="367"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=160><b>tn</b> Further difficulties are created by the meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#961;&#948;&#943;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kardia</font>) in 3:19. Although it may be agreed that the term generally refers to the &#8220;center and source of the whole inner life, w. its thinking, feeling, and volition&#8221; (BDAG 508 s.v. l.b), this may be further subdivided into references to (a) &#8220;the faculty of thought&#8230;as the organ of natural and spiritual enlightenment,&#8221; that is, the mind; (b) &#8220;the will and its decisions&#8221;; (c) &#8220;the emotions, wishes, desires,&#8221; i.e., the emotions or feelings; or (d) &#8220;moral decisions, the moral life,&#8221; that is, the part of the individual where moral decisions are made, which is commonly called the conscience. Thus <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#961;&#948;&#943;&#945;</font> in 3:19 could refer to either the mind, the will, the emotions, or the conscience, and it is not transparently clear which concept the author has primarily in view. In light of the overall context, which seems to discuss the believer&#8217;s assurance of his or her standing before God (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#956;&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#952;&#949;&#957; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</font> [<font face="Greektl">emprosqen autou</font>] in 3:19 and the mention of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#961;&#951;&#963;&#943;&#945;</font> [<font face="Greektl">parrhsia</font>, &#8220;boldness&#8221; or &#8220;confidence&#8221;] in 3:21) it seems probable that the <i>conscience</i>, that aspect of one&#8217;s <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#961;&#948;&#943;&#945;</font> which involves moral choices and the guilt or approval for having made them, is primarily in view here. Thus the meaning &#8220;convince&#8221; is preferred for the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#949;&#943;&#952;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">peiqw</font>), since the overall subject seems to be the believer&#8217;s assurance of his or her standing before God, especially in the case when (v. 20) the believer&#8217;s conscience attempts to condemn him on account of sin.</p>
