<A NAME="313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=106><b>sn</b> The phrase <i>we will be like him, because we will see him just as he is</i> has been explained two ways: (1) believers will really become more like God than they now are, and will do this through seeing God as he really is; or (2) believers will realize that they are already like God, but did not realize it until they see him as he is. One who sees a strong emphasis on realized eschatology in the Gospel of John and the Epistles might opt for the second view, since it downplays the difference between what believers already are in the present age and what they will become in the next. It seems better, though, in light of the statement in 3:2a that &#8220;what we will be has not yet been revealed&#8221; and because of the reference to Christ&#8217;s parousia in 2:28, that the author intends to distinguish between the present state of believers and what they will be like in the future. Thus the first view is better, that believers really will become more like God than they are now, as a result of seeing him as he really is.</p>
