<A NAME="339"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=132><b>tn</b> It could be argued (1) that the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joti</font>) at the beginning of 3:11 is grammatically subordinate to the preceding statement at the end of 3:10. As BDF §456.1 points out, however, &#8220;Subordination with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#972;&#964;&#953;</font> is often very loose&#8230;and must be translated &#8216;for.&#8217;&#8221; Thus (2) <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> assumes an inferential sense, standing at the beginning of a new sentence and drawing an inference based upon all that has preceded. This is confirmed by the structural parallel between the present verse and 1:5.</p>
