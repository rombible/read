<A NAME="364"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=157><b>sn</b> The noun <i>truth </i>here has been interpreted in various ways: (1) There are a number of interpreters who understand the final noun in this series, <i>truth</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#949;&#943;&#8115;</font>, <font face="Greektl">alhqeia</font>) in an adverbial sense (&#8220;truly&#8221; or &#8220;in sincerity&#8221;), describing the way in which believers are to love. If the two pairs of nouns are compared, however, it is hard to see how the second noun <i>with tongue</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#955;&#8061;&#963;&#963;&#8131;</font>, <font face="Greektl">glwssh</font>) in the first pair can have an adverbial sense. (2) It seems better to understand the first noun in each pair as <i>produced</i> by the second noun: Words are produced by the tongue, and the (righteous) deeds with which believers are to love one another are produced by the truth.</p>
