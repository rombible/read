<A NAME="330"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=123><b>tn</b> In the Gospel of John <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#973;&#963;&#8131;</font> (<font face="Greektl">lush</font>) is used both literally and figuratively. In John 1:27 it refers to a literal loosing of one&#8217;s sandal-thong, and in John 2:19 to a destruction of Jesus&#8217; physical body which was understood by the hearers to refer to physical destruction of the Jerusalem temple. In John 5:18 it refers to the breaking of the Sabbath, in John 7:23 to the breaking of the law of Moses, and in John 10:35 to the breaking of the scriptures. The verb is again used literally in John 11:44 at the resurrection of Lazarus when Jesus commands that he be released from the graveclothes with which he was bound. Here in 1 John 3:8 the verb means, with reference to &#8220;the works of the devil,&#8221; to &#8220;destroy, bring to an end, abolish.&#8221; See BDAG 607 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#973;&#969;</font> 4 and F.
