<A NAME="34"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=97><b>tn</b> Lexically it is clear that this phrase indicates reason, but what is not clear is whether (1) <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959;</font> (<font face="Greektl">touto</font>) refers to what follows, (2) to what precedes, or (3) to both (as with the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959;</font> [<font face="Greektl">en touto</font>] phrases throughout 1 John). <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#916;&#953;&#8048; &#964;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959;</font> (<font face="Greektl">dia touto</font>) occurs 15 times in the Gospel of John, and a pattern emerges which is so consistent that it appears to be the key to the usage here. Six times in the Gospel of John (5:16, 18; 8:47; 10:17; 12:18, 39) the phrase refers to what follows, and in each of these instances an epexegetical <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joti</font>) clause follows. Nine times in John (1:31, 6:65, 7:21-22, 9:23, 12:27, 13:11, 15:19, 16:15, 19:11) the phrase refers to what precedes, and in none of these instances is it followed by a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause. The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#8048; &#964;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959;</font> is used three times in the Johannine Epistles. In two of these (1 John 4:5, 3 John 10) there is no <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause following, and so the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#8048; &#964;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959;</font> should refer to preceding material. Here in 3:1 there is an epexegetical <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause following, so the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#8048; &#964;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959;</font> should (unless it is the only exception in the Gospel of John and the Johannine Epistles) refer to what follows, that is, to the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause itself. This is indicated by the colon in the translation.</p>
