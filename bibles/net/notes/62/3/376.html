<A NAME="376"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">76</span><note=169><b>sn</b> The author of 1 John repeatedly attributes the commandments given to believers as given by God the Father, even though in John 13:34-35 it was Jesus who gave the commandment to love one another. 2 John 4-5 also attributes the commandment to love one another directly to the Father. Thus it is clear that God the Father is the subject of the verb <i>gave</i> here in 3:23.</p>
