<A NAME="347"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=140><b>tn</b> The first <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joti</font>) clause, following a verb of perception, introduces an indirect discourse clause giving the content of what the readers are assumed to know: that they have passed over from death to life, that is, that they possess eternal life. The author gives a similar reassurance to his readers in 5:13. Alternation between the verbs <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#7990;&#948;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">oida</font>) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#953;&#957;&#8061;&#963;&#954;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ginwskw</font>) in 1 John is probably a matter of stylistic variation (of which the writer is extremely fond) rather than indicative of a subtle difference in meaning.</p>
