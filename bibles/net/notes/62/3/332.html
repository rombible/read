<A NAME="332"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=125><b>tn</b> The problem of the present tense of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#959;&#953;&#949;&#8150;</font> (<font face="Greektl">poiei</font>) here is exactly that of the present tense of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7937;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#940;&#957;&#949;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jamartanei</font>) in 3:6. Here in 3:9 the distinction is sharply drawn between &#8220;the one who practices sin&#8221; in 3:8, who is of the devil, and &#8220;the one who is fathered by God&#8221; in 3:9, who &#8220;does not practice sin.&#8221; See S. Kubo (&#8220;I John 3:9: Absolute or Habitual?&#8221; <i>AUSS </i>7 [1969]: 47-56) for a fuller discussion of the author&#8217;s argument as based on a sharp antithesis between the recipients (true Christians) and the opponents (heretics).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Does not practice sin. </i>Again, as in 3:6, the author is making a clear distinction between the opponents, who as moral indifferentists downplay the significance of sin in the life of the Christian, and the recipients, who as true Christians recognize the significance of sin because Jesus came to take it away (3:5) and to destroy it as a work of the devil (3:8). This explanation still has to deal with the apparent contradiction between the author&#8217;s statements in 2:1-2 and those here in 3:9, but this is best explained in terms of the author&#8217;s tendency to present issues in &#8220;either/or&#8221; terms to bring out the drastic contrast between his readers, whom he regards as true believers, and the opponents, whom he regards as false. In 2:1-2 the author can acknowledge the possibility that a true Christian might on occasion sin, because in this context he wishes to reassure his readers that the statements he has made about the opponents in the preceding context do not apply to them. But in 3:4-10, his concern is to bring out the absolute difference between the opponents and his readers, so he speaks in theoretical terms which do not discuss the possible occasional exception, because to do so would weaken his argument.</p>
