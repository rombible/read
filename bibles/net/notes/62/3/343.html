<A NAME="343"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=136><b>sn</b> Since the author states that <i>Cain</i>&#8230;<i>was of the evil one</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#960;&#959;&#957;&#951;&#961;&#959;&#8166;</font>, <font face="Greektl">ek tou ponhrou</font>), in the immediate context this imagery serves as an illustration of 3:8a: The person who practices sin is <i>of the devil</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#946;&#972;&#955;&#959;&#965;</font>, <font face="Greektl">ek tou diabolou</font>). This is similar to John 8:44, where Jesus told his opponents &#8220;you people are from your father the devil&#8230;[who] was a murderer from the beginning.&#8221; In both Jewish and early Christian writings Cain is a model for those who deliberately disbelieve; Testament of Benjamin 7:5 looks forward to the punishment of those who &#8220;are like Cain in the envy and hatred of brothers.&#8221; It is not difficult to see why the author of 1 John used Cain here as a model for the opponents in light of their failure to &#8220;love the brothers&#8221; (see 1 John 3:17).</p>
