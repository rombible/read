<A NAME="335"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=128><b>tn</b> The closest meaning for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#960;&#941;&#961;&#956;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">sperma</font>) in this context is &#8220;male generating seed&#8221; (cf. BDAG 937 s.v. 1.b), although this is a figurative rather than a literal sense. Such imagery is bold and has seemed crudely anthropomorphic to some interpreters, but it poses no more difficulty than the image of God as a male parent fathering Christians that appears in John 1:13 and is behind the use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#949;&#957;&#957;&#940;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">gennaw</font>) with reference to Christians in 1 John 2:29; 3:9; 4:7; 5:1, 4, and 18.</p>
