<A NAME="310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=103><b>tn</b> Many take the understood subject (&#8220;he&#8221;) of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#966;&#945;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#969;&#952;&#8135;</font> (<font face="Greektl">fanerwqh</font>) as a reference to Jesus Christ, because the same verb was used in 2:28 in reference to the parousia (second advent). In the immediate context, however, a better analogy is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#966;&#945;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#8061;&#952;&#951; &#964;&#943; &#7952;&#963;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#952;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">efanerwqh ti esomeqa</font>) in 3:2a. There the clause <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#943; &#7952;&#963;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#952;&#945;</font> is the subject of the passive verb: &#8220;<i>what we shall be</i> has not yet been revealed.&#8221; From a grammatical standpoint it makes better sense to see the understood subject of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#966;&#945;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#969;&#952;&#8135;</font> as &#8220;it&#8221; rather than &#8220;he&#8221; and as referring back to the clause <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#943; &#7952;&#963;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#952;&#945;</font> in 3:2a. In the context this makes good sense: &#8220;Beloved, now we are children of God, and <i>what we shall be</i> has not yet been revealed. We know that whenever <i>it shall be revealed</i>, we shall be like him, because we shall see him just as he is.&#8221; This emphasizes the contrast in the verse between the present state (&#8220;not yet been revealed&#8221;) and the future state (&#8220;shall be revealed&#8221;) of believers, and this will of course take place at the parousia.</p>
