<A NAME="22"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=13><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;gospel&#8221; is not in the Greek text but is supplied to clarify the meaning. See the note on the following word &#8220;message.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="23"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=14><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#943;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">angelia</font>) occurs only twice in the NT, here and in 1 John 3:11. It is a cognate of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#960;&#945;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#943;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">epangelia</font>) which occurs much more frequently (some 52 times in the NT) including 1 John 2:25. BDAG 8 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#943;&#945;</font> 1 offers the meaning &#8220;message&#8221; which suggests some overlap with the semantic range of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">logos</font>), although in the specific context of 1:5 BDAG suggests a reference to the gospel. (The precise &#8220;content&#8221; of this &#8220;good news&#8217; is given by the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> [<font face="Greektl">Joti</font>] clause which follows in 1:5b.) The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#943;&#945;</font> here is closely equivalent to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#8016;&#945;&#947;&#947;&#941;&#955;&#953;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">euangelion</font>): (1) it refers to the proclamation of the eyewitness testimony about the life and ministry of Jesus Christ as proclaimed by the author and the rest of the apostolic witnesses (prologue, esp. 1:3-4), and (2) it relates to the salvation of the hearers/readers, since the purpose of this proclamation is to bring them into fellowship with God and with the apostolic witnesses (1:3). Because of this the adjective &#8220;gospel&#8221; is included in the English translation.</p>
<A NAME="24"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=15><b>tn</b> The referent of the pronoun &#8220;him&#8221; is not entirely clear in the Greek text; it could be either (1) God the Father, or (2) Jesus Christ, both of whom are mentioned at the end of v. 3. A reference to Jesus Christ is more likely because this is the nearest possible antecedent, and because God (the Father) is specifically mentioned in the following clause in v. 5.</p>
<A NAME="25"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=16><b>tn</b> The key to understanding the first major section of 1 John, 1:5-3:10, is found in the statement in v. 5: &#8220;<i>God is light and in him there is no darkness at all</i>.&#8221; The idea of &#8220;proclamation&#8221; &#8211; the apostolic proclamation of eyewitness testimony which the prologue introduces (1:2, 3) &#8211; is picked up in 1:5 by the use of the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#943;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">angelia</font>) and the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#945;&#947;&#947;&#941;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anangellomen</font>), cognate to the verb in 1:3. The content of this proclamation is given by the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joti</font>) clause in 1:5 as the assertion that God is light, so this statement should be understood as the author&#8217;s formulation of the apostolic eyewitness testimony introduced in the prologue. (This corresponds to the apostolic preaching elsewhere referred to as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#8053;&#961;&#965;&#947;&#956;&#945;</font> [<font face="Greektl">khrugma</font>], although the term the Apostle John uses here is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#943;&#945;</font>.)</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Following the theme statement in 1:5, <i>God is light and in him there is no darkness at all</i>, the author presents a series of three claims and counterclaims that make up the first unit of 1 John (1:5-2:2). The three claims begin with &#8220;if&#8221; (1:6, 8, 10) and the three counterclaims begin with &#8220;but if&#8221; (1:7, 9; 2:1).</p>
<A NAME="26"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=17><b>tn</b> The context of this statement in 1:6 indicates clearly that the progressive (continuative or durative) aspect of the present tense must be in view here.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b><i> </i>The relationship of the phrase <i>keep on walking</i> to <i>if we say</i> is very important for understanding the problem expressed in 1:6. If one should say (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7988;&#960;&#969;&#956;&#949;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">eipwmen</font>) that he has fellowship with God, and yet continues walking (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#960;&#945;&#964;&#8182;&#956;&#949;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">peripatwmen</font>) in the darkness, then it follows (in the apodosis, the &#8220;then&#8221; clause) that he is lying and not practicing the truth.</p>

<A NAME="29"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=20><b>tn</b> BDAG 50 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7937;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#943;&#945;</font> 1 defines this term as &#8220;a departure fr. either human or divine standards of uprightness&#8221; (see 1 John 5:17 where <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7937;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#943;&#945;</font> [<font face="Greektl">Jamartia</font>] and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#948;&#953;&#954;&#943;&#945;</font> [<font face="Greektl">adikia</font>] are related). This word occurs 17 times in 1 John, of which 11 are singular and 6 are plural.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>From all sin. </i>Sometimes a distinction between singular &#8220;sin&#8221; and plural &#8220;sins&#8221; has been suggested: Some would see the singular <i>all sin</i> of 1:7 as a reference to sinfulness before conversion and the plural <i>sins</i> of 1:9 as a reference to sins committed after one became a Christian. This amounts to making 1:7 refer to initial justification and 1:9 to sanctification. But the phrase <i>all sin </i>in 1:7 is so comprehensive that it can hardly be limited to preconversion sins, and the emphasis on &#8220;walking&#8221; in 1:7 strongly suggests that the Christian life is in view (not one&#8217;s life before conversion). In 1 John 1:8 sin appears as a condition or characteristic quality, which in 1:10 is regarded as universal. Apart from forgiveness in Christ it results in alienation from God (2:15) and spiritual death (3:14). But according to 1 John 1:7, cleansing from sin is possible by the blood (representing the sacrificial death) of Jesus.</p>
<A NAME="210"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=21><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;say we do not have sin.&#8221; The use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#967;&#969;</font> + <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7937;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#943;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ecw</font> + <font face="Greektl">Jamartia</font>) is an expression limited to John and 1 John in the NT. On the analogy with other constructions where <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#967;&#969;</font> governs an abstract noun (e.g., 1 John 1:3, 6, 7; 2:28; 3:3, 15, 21; 4:16, 17; 5:12-13), it indicates that a <i>state</i> is involved, which in the case of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7937;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#943;&#945;</font> would refer to <i>a state of sin</i>. The four times the expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#967;&#969;</font> + <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7937;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#943;&#945;</font> occurs in the Gospel of John (9:41; 15:22, 24; 19:11) all refer to situations where a wrong action has been committed or a wrong attitude has already existed, resulting in a state of sin, and then something else happens which further emphasizes the evil of that action or attitude. Here in 1 John 1:8 the sense is the same. The author is addressing people who have sinned (resulting in a state of sin), warning them that they cannot claim to be free from the guilt of that sin. The context of 1 John does not imply libertinism (where sins are flaunted as a way of demonstrating one&#8217;s &#8220;liberty&#8221;) on the part of the opponents, since the author makes no explicit charges of immoral behavior against his opponents. The worst the author explicitly says is that they have failed to love the brethren (1 John 3:17). It seems more likely that the opponents were saying that things a believer did after conversion were not significant enough to be &#8220;sins&#8221; that could challenge one&#8217;s intimate relationship with God (a relationship the author denies that the opponents have to begin with).</p>

The translation with participles (&#8220;forgiving, &#8230;cleansing&#8221;) conveys this idea of result.</p>

<A NAME="214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=25><b>sn</b> <i>My little children. </i>The direct address by the author to his readers at the beginning of 2:1 marks a break in the pattern of the opponents&#8217; claims (indicated by the phrase <i>if we say </i>followed by a negative statement in the apodosis, the &#8220;then&#8221; clause) and the author&#8217;s counterclaims (represented by <i>if</i> with a positive statement in the apodosis) made so far in 1:6-10. The seriousness of this last claim (in 1:10) causes the author to interrupt himself to address the readers as his faithful children and to explain to them that while he wants them not to sin, they may be assured that if they do, they can look to Jesus Christ, as their advocate with the Father, to intercede for them. After this, the last of the author&#8217;s three counter-claims in 1:5-2:2 is found in the <i>if </i>clause in 2:1b.</p>
<A NAME="215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=26><b>tn</b> There is some dispute over the significance of the aorist tense of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7937;&#956;&#940;&#961;&#964;&#951;&#964;&#949;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jamarthte</font>): (1) F. Stagg (&#8220;Orthodoxy and Orthopraxy in the Johannine Epistles,&#8221; <i>RevExp </i>67 [1970]:423-32, esp. 428) holds that the aorist is nondescriptive, saying nothing about the nature of the action itself, but only that the action has happened. This is indeed the normal aspectual value of the aorist tense in general, but there is some disagreement over whether with this particular verb there are more specific nuances of meaning. (2) M. Zerwick (<i>Biblical Greek</i> §251) and N. Turner (MHT 3:72) agree that the <i>present</i> tense of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7937;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#940;&#957;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jamartanw</font>) means &#8220;to be in a state of sin&#8221; (i.e., a sinner) while the <i>aorist</i> refers to specific acts of sin. Without attempting to sort out this particular dispute, it should be noted that certain verbs do have different nuances of meaning in different tenses, nuances which do not derive solely from the aspectual value of the tense per se, but from a combination of semantic factors which vary from word to word.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>So that you may not sin. </i>It is clear the author is <i>not</i> simply exhorting the readers not to be habitual or repetitive sinners, as if to imply that occasional acts of sin would be acceptable. The purpose of the author here is that the readers not sin <i>at all</i>, just as Jesus told the man he healed in John 5:14 &#8220;Don&#8217;t sin any more.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=27><b>tn</b> The description of the Holy Spirit as &#8220;Paraclete&#8221; is unique to the Gospel of John (14:16, 26; 15:26; and 16:7). Here, in the only other use of the word in the NT, it is Jesus, not the Spirit, who is described as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#940;&#954;&#955;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">paraklhto&quot;</font>). The reader should have been prepared for this interchangeability of terminology, however, by John 14:16, where Jesus told the disciples that he would ask the Father to send them &#8216;another&#8217; paraclete (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">allos</font>, &#8220;another of the same kind&#8221;). This implies that <i>Jesus himself had been a paraclete</i> in his earthly ministry to the disciples. This does not answer all the questions about the meaning of the word here, though, since it is not Jesus&#8217; role as an advocate during his earthly ministry which is in view, but his role as an advocate in heaven before the Father. The context suggests intercession in the sense of legal advocacy, as stress is placed upon the righteousness of Jesus (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#957; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#948;&#943;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Ihsoun Criston dikaion</font>). The concept of Jesus&#8217; intercession on behalf of believers does occur elsewhere in the NT, notably in Rom 8:34 and Heb 7:25. Something similar is taking place here, and is the best explanation of 1 John 2:1. An English translation like &#8220;advocate&#8221; or &#8220;intercessor&#8221; conveys this.</p>
<A NAME="217"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=28><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Jesus Christ the righteous.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="218"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=29><b>tn</b> A suitable English translation for this word (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7985;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#956;&#972;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Jilasmos</font>) is a difficult and even controversial problem. &#8220;Expiation,&#8221; &#8220;propitiation,&#8221; and &#8220;atonement&#8221; have all been suggested. L. Morris, in a study that has become central to discussions of this topic (<i>The Apostolic Preaching of the Cross</i>, 140), sees as an integral part of the meaning of the word (as in the other words in the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7985;&#955;&#940;&#963;&#954;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953;</font> [<font face="Greektl">Jilaskomai</font>] group) the idea <i>of turning away the divine wrath</i>, suggesting that &#8220;propitiation&#8221; is the closest English equivalent. It is certainly possible to see an averting of divine wrath in this context, where the sins of believers are in view and Jesus is said to be acting as Advocate on behalf of believers. R. E. Brown&#8217;s point (<i>Epistles of John</i> [AB], 220-21), that it is essentially cleansing from sin which is in view here and in the other use of the word in 4:10, is well taken, but the two connotations (averting wrath and cleansing) are not mutually exclusive and it is unlikely that the propitiatory aspect of Jesus&#8217; work should be ruled out entirely in the usage in 2:2. Nevertheless, the English word &#8220;propitiation&#8221; is too technical to communicate to many modern readers, and a term like &#8220;atoning sacrifice&#8221; (given by Webster&#8217;s <i>New International Dictionary</i> as a definition of &#8220;propitiation&#8221;) is more appropriate here. Another term, &#8220;satisfaction,&#8221; might also convey the idea, but &#8220;satisfaction&#8221; in Roman Catholic theology is a technical term for the performance of the penance imposed by the priest on a penitent.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The Greek word (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7985;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#956;&#972;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Jilasmos</font>) behind the phrase <i>atoning sacrifice </i>conveys both the idea of &#8220;turning aside divine wrath&#8221; and the idea of &#8220;cleansing from sin.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=30><b>tn</b> Many translations supply an understood repetition of the word &#8220;sins&#8221; here, thus: &#8220;but also for the sins of the whole world.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=31><b>tn</b> The translation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) at the beginning of 2:3 is important for understanding the argument, because a similar <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> occurs at the beginning of 1:5. The use here is not just a simple continuative or connective use, but has more of a resumptive force, pointing back to the previous use in 1:5.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Now. </i>The author, after discussing three claims of the opponents in 1:6, 8, and 10 and putting forward three counterclaims of his own in 1:7, 1:9, and 2:1, now returns to the theme of &#8220;God as light&#8221; introduced in 1:5. The author will now discuss how a Christian may have assurance that he or she has come to know the God who is light, again by contrast with the opponents who make the same profession of knowing God, but lack the reality of such knowledge, as their behavior makes clear.</p>
<A NAME="221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=32><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;know him.&#8221; (1) Many take the third person pronoun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">auton</font>) to refer to Jesus Christ, since he is mentioned in 2:1 and the pronoun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">autos</font>) at the beginning of 2:2 clearly refers to him. But (2) it is more likely that God is the referent here, since (a) the assurance the author is discussing here is assurance that one has come to know God (all the claims of the opponents in 1:5-2:11 concern knowing and having fellowship with the God who is light); (b) when Jesus Christ is explicitly mentioned as an example to follow in 1 John 2:6, the pronoun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954;&#949;&#8150;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ekeinos</font>) is used to distinguish this from previous references with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font>; (c) the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) which begins 2:3 is parallel to the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> which begins 1:5, suggesting that the author is now returning to the discussion of God who is light, a theme introduced in 1:5.

<A NAME="225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=36><b>tn</b> The Greek verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#941;&#957;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">menw</font>) is commonly translated into contemporary English as &#8220;remain&#8221; or &#8220;abide,&#8221; but both of these translations have some problems: (1) &#8220;Abide&#8221; has become in some circles almost a &#8220;technical term&#8221; for some sort of special intimate fellowship or close relationship between the Christian and God, so that one may speak of Christians who are &#8220;abiding&#8221; and Christians who are not. It is accurate to say the word indicates a close, intimate (and permanent) relationship between the believer and God. However, it is very important to note that for the author of the Gospel of John and the Johannine Epistles <i>every </i>genuine Christian has this type of relationship with God, and the person who does not have this type of relationship (cf. 2 John 9) is not a believer at all (in spite of what he or she may claim). (2) On the other hand, to translate <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#941;&#957;&#969;</font> as &#8220;remain&#8221; removes some of these problems, but creates others: In certain contexts, such a translation can give the impression that those who currently &#8220;remain&#8221; in this relationship with God can at some point choose not to &#8220;remain&#8221;, that is, to abandon their faith and return to an unsaved condition. While one may easily think in terms of the author&#8217;s opponents in 1 John as not &#8220;remaining,&#8221; the author makes it inescapably clear in 2:19 that these people, in spite of their claims to know God and be in fellowship with God, <i>never</i> really were genuine believers. (3) In an attempt to avoid both these misconceptions, this translation renders <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#941;&#957;&#969;</font> as &#8220;reside&#8221; <i>except</i> in cases where the context indicates that &#8220;remain&#8221; is a more accurate nuance, that is, in contexts where a specific change of status or movement from one position to another is in view.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The Greek word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#941;&#957;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">menw</font>) translated <i>resides</i> indicates a close, intimate (and permanent) relationship between the believer and God.

But the statement following the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> is about light and darkness, and it is difficult to see how this has anything to do with the commandment, especially as the commandment is related to the &#8220;new commandment&#8221; of John 13:34 for believers to love one another. It is far more likely that (3) the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause should be understood as causal, but this still does not answer the question of whether it offers the reason for writing the &#8220;new commandment&#8221; itself or the reason for the relative clause (&#8220;that is true in him and in you&#8221;). It probably gives the reason for the writing of the commandment, although R. E. Brown (<i>Epistles of John</i> [AB], 268) thinks it refers to both.</p>
<A NAME="233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=44><b>sn</b> The reference to <i>the darkness&#8230;passing away and the true light&#8230;already shining </i>is an allusion to John 1:5, 1:9, and 8:12.

BDAG 18 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#972;&#962;</font> 2.a). In the repeated uses of this form of address throughout the letter, it is important to remember that sometimes it refers (1) to genuine Christians (those who have remained faithful to the apostolic eyewitness testimony about who Jesus is, as outlined in the Prologue to the letter, 1:1-4; an example of this usage is 2:10; 3:14, 16), but often it refers (2) to the secessionist opponents whose views the author rejects (examples are found here at 2:9, as well as 2:11; 3:10; 3:15; 3:17; 4:20). Of course, to be technically accurate, in the latter case the reference is really to a &#8220;fellow member of the community&#8221;; the use of the term &#8220;fellow Christian&#8221; in the translation no more implies that such an individual is genuinely saved than the literal term &#8220;brother&#8221; which the author uses for such people. But a translation like &#8220;fellow member of the community&#8221; or &#8220;fellow member of the congregation&#8221; is extremely awkward and simply cannot be employed consistently throughout.</p>

This evidence suggests that the person is the referent here.</p>
<A NAME="238"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=49><b>sn</b> <i>The one who hates his fellow Christian. </i>The author&#8217;s paradigm for the opponents portrays them as those who show hatred for fellow Christians (<i>Grk </i>&#8220;brothers,&#8221; but not referring to one&#8217;s physical siblings). This charge will be much more fully developed in chap. 3, where the author will compare the opponents to Cain (who is the model for one who hates a brother, since he ultimately murdered his own brother).

As with the three claims beginning with &#8220;if&#8221; in the previous section (1:6, 8, 10), these indirectly reflect the claims of the opponents.

<A NAME="240"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=51><b>sn</b> <i>I am writing to you. </i>The author appears to have been concerned that some of his readers, at least, would accept the claims of the opponents as voiced in 1:6, 8, and 10. The counterclaims the author has made in 1:7, 9, and 2:1 seem intended to strengthen the readers and reassure them (among other things) that their sins are forgiven. Further assurances of their position here is in keeping with such a theme, and indeed, the topic of reassurance runs throughout the entire letter (see the purpose statement in 5:13). Finally, in such a context the warning which follows in 2:15-17 is not out of place because the author is dealing with a community that is discouraged by the controversy which has arisen within it and that is in need of exhortation.</p>
<A NAME="241"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=52><b>tn</b> The <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joti</font>) that follows all six occurrences of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#961;&#940;&#966;&#969;</font>/<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#947;&#961;&#945;&#968;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">grafw</font>/<font face="Greektl">egraya</font>) in 2:12-14 can be understood as introducing either (1) a causal clause or (2) a content clause (if content, it could be said to introduce a direct object clause or an indirect discourse clause). Many interpreters have favored a causal translation, so that in each of the six cases what follows the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> gives the reason why the author is writing to the recipients. Usage in similar constructions is not decisive because only one other instance of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#961;&#940;&#966;&#969;</font> followed by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> occurs in 1 John (2:21), and that context is just as ambiguous as this one. On other occasions <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#961;&#940;&#966;&#969;</font> does tend to be followed by a noun or pronoun functioning as direct object. This might argue for the content usage here, but it could also be argued that the direct object in the six instances in these verses is understood, namely, the content of the entire letter itself. Thus the following <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause could still be causal. Grammatical considerations aside, these uses of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> are more likely introducing content clauses here rather than causal clauses because such a meaning better fits the context. If the uses of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> are understood as causal, it is difficult to see why the author immediately gives a warning in the section that follows about loving the world. The confidence he has expressed in his readers (if the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clauses are understood as causal) would appear to be ill-founded if he is so concerned about their relationship to the world as 2:15-17 seems to indicate. On the other hand, understanding the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clauses as content clauses fits very well the context of reassurance which runs throughout the letter.</p>

This understanding better fits the context here: The focus is on people who operate purely on a human level and have no spiritual dimension to their existence.

It is probably best to see the phrase here as transitional as well; thus <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has been translated &#8220;now&#8221; rather than &#8220;and.&#8221; The accusative phrase at the end of v. 25, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8052;&#957; &#950;&#969;&#8052;&#957; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#945;&#7984;&#8061;&#957;&#953;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">thn zwhn thn aiwnion</font>), stands in apposition to the relative pronoun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7973;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jhn</font>), whose antecedent is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969; &#7952;&#960;&#945;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#943;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jh epangelia</font>; see BDF §295). Thus the &#8220;promise&#8221; consists of &#8220;eternal life.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="266"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=77><b>tn</b> The pronoun could refer to God or Jesus Christ, but a reference to Jesus Christ is more likely here.</p>
<A NAME="267"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=78><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;he himself promised.&#8221; The repetition of the cognate verb &#8220;promised&#8221; after the noun &#8220;promise&#8221; is redundant in English. </p>
<A NAME="268"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">68</span><note=79><b>sn</b> The promise consists of <i>eternal life</i>, but it is also related to the concept of &#8220;remaining&#8221; in 2:24. The person who &#8220;remains in the Son and in the Father&#8221; thus has this promise of eternal life from Jesus himself. Consistent with this, 1 John 5:12 implies that the believer has this eternal life <i>now</i>, not just in the future, and this in turn agrees with John 5:24.</p>
<A NAME="269"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">69</span><note=80><b>sn</b> The phrase <i>those who are trying to deceive you </i>in 1 John 2:26 is a clear reference to the secessionist opponents mentioned earlier in 1 John 2:19, who are attempting to <i>deceive</i> the people the author is writing to.</p>
<A NAME="270"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">70</span><note=81><b>sn</b> <i>The anointing. </i>The &#8220;anointing&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#967;&#961;&#8150;&#963;&#956;&#945;</font>, <font face="Greektl">crisma</font>) which believers have received refers to the indwelling Holy Spirit which has been given to them at their conversion.</p>
<A NAME="271"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=82><b>sn</b> The pronoun could refer to God or Jesus Christ, but a reference to Jesus Christ is more likely here.</p>
<A NAME="272"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">72</span><note=83><b>tn</b> This use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#941;&#957;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">menw</font>) has been translated &#8220;reside&#8221; both times in 2:27 because it refers to the current status of believers.</p>
<A NAME="273"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">73</span><note=84><b>sn</b> The pronoun could refer (1) to God or (2) to Jesus Christ, but a reference to Jesus Christ is more likely here.</p>
<A NAME="274"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">74</span><note=85><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;and is not a lie, and just as.&#8221; Because of the length and complexity of the Greek sentence, a new sentence was started here in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="275"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">75</span><note=86><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;he.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="276"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">76</span><note=87><b>tn</b> The verb may be read as either (1) indicative or (2) imperative mood. The same verb is found in the following verse, 2:28, but the address to the readers there seems clearly to indicate an imperative. On analogy some have called for an imperative here, but others have seen this as suggesting an indicative here, so that the author is not repeating himself. An indicative is slightly more likely here. Up to this point the thrust of the author has been reassurance rather than exhortation, and an indicative here (&#8220;&#8230;you reside in him&#8221;) balances the indicative in the first part of 2:27 (&#8220;the anointing which you received from him resides in you&#8230;&#8221;). With the following verse the author switches from reassurance (the readers at the time he is writing still &#8216;remain&#8217;; they have not yet adopted the teaching of the opponents) to exhortation (he is writing so that they will &#8216;remain&#8217; and not succumb to the deception of the opponents).</p>
<A NAME="277"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">77</span><note=88><b>tn</b> Again, as at the end of 2:27, the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#949;</font> (<font face="Greektl">menete</font>) may be read as either (1) indicative or (2) imperative mood. At the end of 2:27 the translation opted for an indicative because the author had been attempting to reassure his readers that they did indeed possess eternal life, and also because an indicative at the end of 2:27 balances the indicative reference to the &#8220;anointing&#8221; residing in the readers at the beginning of the verse. With the return in 2:28 to the eschatological note introduced in 2:18, however, it appears that the author switches from reassurance to exhortation. At the time he is writing them, the readers do still &#8220;remain&#8221; since they have not yet adopted the heretical teaching of the opponents. But now the author wants to forestall the possibility that they might do so at some point, and so he begins this section with an exhortation to the readers to &#8220;reside/remain&#8221; in Christ. This suggests that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#949;</font> in the present verse should be read as imperative rather than indicative, a view made even more probable by the following <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jina</font>) clause which states the purpose for the exhortation: in order that at the parousia (second advent) when Jesus Christ is revealed, the readers may have confidence and not shrink back from him in shame when he appears.</p>
<A NAME="278"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">78</span><note=89><b>sn</b> A reference to Jesus Christ is more likely here. Note the mention of the second coming (second advent) at the end of this verse.</p>
<A NAME="279"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">79</span><note=90><b>tn</b> In this context <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#940;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ean</font>) does not indicate uncertainty about <i>whether</i> or not Christ will return, but rather uncertainty about the exact time <i>when </i>the event will take place. In the Koine period <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#940;&#957;</font> could mean &#8220;when&#8221; or &#8220;whenever&#8221; and was virtually the equivalent of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#945;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">{otan</font>; see BDAG 268 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#940;&#957;</font> 2). It has this meaning in John 12:32 and 14:3.</p>
<A NAME="280"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">80</span><note=91><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;at his coming.&#8221; </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Have confidence&#8230;shrink away from him in shame when he comes back. </i>Once again in the antithetical framework of Johannine thought (that is, the author&#8217;s tendency to think in terms of polar opposites), there are only two alternatives, just as there are only two alternatives in John 3:18-21, a key section for the understanding of the present passage in 1 John. Anyone who does not &#8216;remain&#8217; demonstrates (just as the opponents demonstrated by their departure from the community in 2:19) that whatever profession he has made is false and he is not truly a believer.</p>
<A NAME="281"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">81</span><note=92><b>tn</b> The mood of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#953;&#957;&#8061;&#963;&#954;&#949;&#964;&#949;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ginwskete</font>) may be understood as (1) indicative or (2) imperative. It is better to understand the verb here as indicative, because in 1 John &#8220;knowledge&#8221; is something one <i>has</i> as a result of being a believer (2:3, 5, 20, 21; 3:16, 19, 24; 4:2, 13; 5:2) rather than something one has to be exhorted about. The change in verbs from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#7990;&#948;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">oida</font>) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#953;&#957;&#8061;&#963;&#954;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ginwskw</font>) is another example of Johannine stylistic variation.</p>
<A NAME="282"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">82</span><note=93><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#949;&#957;&#957;&#940;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">gennaw</font>) presents a translation problem: (1) should the passive be translated archaically &#8220;be begotten&#8221; (the action of the male parent; see BDAG 193 s.v. 1.a) or (2) should it be translated &#8220;be born&#8221; (as from a female parent; see BDAG 194 s.v. 2)? A number of modern translations (RSV, NASB, NIV) have opted for the latter, but (3) the imagery expressed in 1 John 3:9 clearly refers to the action of the male parent in procreating a child, as does 5:1 (&#8220;everyone who loves the father loves the child fathered by him&#8221;), and so a word reflecting the action of the male parent is called for here. The contemporary expression &#8220;fathered by&#8221; captures this idea.</p>
