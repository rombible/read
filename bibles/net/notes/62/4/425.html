<A NAME="425"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=199><b>tn</b> Once again there is the (by now familiar) problem of determining whether the referent of this phrase (1) precedes or (2) follows. Here there are two <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joti</font>) clauses which follow, both of which are epexegetical to the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#8179;</font> (<font face="Greektl">en toutw</font>) and explain what the love of God consists of: first, stated negatively, &#8220;not that we have loved God,&#8221; and then positively, &#8220;but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins.&#8221;</p>
