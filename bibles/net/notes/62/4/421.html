<A NAME="421"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=195><b>tn</b> Once again there is the problem of determining whether the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#8179;</font> (<font face="Greektl">en toutw</font>) refers (1) to what precedes or (2) to what follows. This is the first of 5 uses of the phrase in the present section (4:9, 10, 13, 17; 5:2). In this case (as also in the next two instances) there is a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joti</font>) clause following which is related and which explains (i.e., which is epexegetical to) the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#8179;</font>. Thus the meaning here is, &#8220;<i>By this</i> the love of God is revealed in us: <i>that</i> God has sent his only Son into the world in order that we might live through him.&#8221;</p>
