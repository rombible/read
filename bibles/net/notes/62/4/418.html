<A NAME="418"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=192><b>tn</b> As in 2:23 and 3:4, the author uses <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#8118;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pas</font>) with the present articular participle as a generalization to describe a category of people.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> From the author&#8217;s &#8220;either/or&#8221; perspective (which tends to see things in terms of polar opposites) the use of a generalization like <i>everyone who</i> presents a way of categorizing the opponents on the one hand and the recipients, whom the author regards as genuine Christians, on the other. Thus <i>everyone who loves</i> refers to all true Christians, who give evidence by their love for one another that they have indeed been begotten by God and are thus God&#8217;s children. The opposite situation is described in the following verse, 4:8, where (although <i>everyone</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#8118;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">pas</font>] is omitted) it is clear that a contrast is intended.</p>
