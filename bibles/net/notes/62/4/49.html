<A NAME="49"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=183><b>tn</b> The <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) which begins 4:3 introduces the &#8220;negative side&#8221; of the test by which the spirits might be known in 4:2-3. Thus it is adversative in force: &#8220;every spirit that confesses Jesus as Christ who has come in the flesh is from God, <i>but</i> every Spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God.&#8221;</p>
