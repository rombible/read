<A NAME="416"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=190><b>sn</b> Who or what is <i>the Spirit of truth and the spirit of deceit</i> in 1 John 4:6? (1) Some interpreters regard the &#8220;spirits&#8221; in 4:6 as human spirits. Although 4:1a is ambiguous and might refer either to human spirits or spiritual beings who influence people, it is clear in the context that (2) the author sees behind the secessionist opponents with their false Christology the spirit of the Antichrist, that is, Satan (4:3b), and behind the true believers of the community to which he is writing, the Spirit of God (4:2). This is made clear in 4:4 by the reference to the respective spirits as <i>the One who is in you</i> and <i>the one who is in the world</i>.</p>
