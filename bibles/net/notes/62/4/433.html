<A NAME="433"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=207><b>tn</b> Again whether the referent of the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#8179;</font> (<font face="Greektl">en toutw</font>) (1) precedes or (2) follows is a problem. This time there are two <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joti</font>) clauses which follow. The first is an indirect discourse clause related to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#953;&#957;&#8061;&#963;&#954;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ginwskomen</font>) and giving the content of <i>what</i> believers know: &#8220;that we reside in him and he in us.&#8221; The second <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause is epexegetical (or explanatory) to the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#8179;</font> phrase, explaining <i>how</i> believers know that they reside in God and God remains in them: &#8220;in that he has given us of his Spirit.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>By this we know. </i>According to the author of 1 John, the Father&#8217;s giving of the indwelling Holy Spirit to the believer is one means of providing assurance to the believer of his relationship to God. This is what was also stated in 1 John 3:24b in essentially identical terms.</p>
