<A NAME="423"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=197><b>tn</b> This phrase is best understood as the equivalent of a dative of sphere, but this description does not specify <i>where</i> the love of God is revealed with regard to believers: &#8220;in our midst&#8221; (i.e., among us) or &#8220;within us&#8221; (i.e., internally within believers). The latter is probable, because in the context the concept of God&#8217;s indwelling of the believer is mentioned in 4:12: &#8220;God resides (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#953;</font>, <font face="Greektl">menei</font>) in us.&#8221;</p>
