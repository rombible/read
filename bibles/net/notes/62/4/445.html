<A NAME="445"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=219><b>sn</b> The entire phrase <i>fear has to do with punishment</i> may be understood in two slightly different ways: (1) &#8220;fear has its own punishment&#8221; or (2) &#8220;fear has to do with [includes] punishment.&#8221; These are not far apart, however, and the real key to understanding the expression lies in the meaning of the word &#8220;punishment&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#972;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">kolasis</font>). While it may refer to torture or torment (BDAG 555 s.v. 1) there are numerous Koine references involving eternal punishment (2 Macc 4:38; <i>T. Reu.</i> 5:5; <i>T. Gad</i> 7:5) and this is also the use in the only other NT reference, Matt 25:46. In the present context, where the author has mentioned having <i>confidence in the day of judgment</i> (4:17), it seems virtually certain that eternal punishment (or fear of it) is what is meant here. The (only) alternative to perfected love, which results in confidence at the day of judgment, is fear, which has to do with the punishment one is afraid of receiving at the judgment. As 4:18b states, &#8220;<i>the one who fears [punishment] has not been perfected in love</i>.&#8221; It is often assumed by interpreters that the opposite to <i>perfected</i> love (which casts out fear) is <i>imperfect</i> love (which still has fear and therefore no assurance). This is possible, but it is not likely, because the author nowhere mentions &#8216;imperfect&#8217; love, and for him the opposite of &#8216;perfected&#8217; love appears to be not imperfect love but hate (cf. 4:20). In other words, in the antithetical (&#8216;either/or&#8217;) categories in which the author presents his arguments, one is either a genuine believer, who becomes &#8216;perfected&#8217; in love as he resides in love and in a mutually indwelling relationship with God (cf. 4:16b), <i>or</i> one is not a genuine believer at all, but one who (like the opponents) hates his brother, is a liar, and does not know God at all. This individual should well fear judgment and eternal punishment because in the author&#8217;s view that is precisely where such a person is headed.</p>
