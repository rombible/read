<A NAME="442"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=216><b>tn</b> The referent of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#8179;</font> (<font face="Greektl">en toutw</font>) here is more difficult to determine than most, because while there are both <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jina</font>) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joti</font>) clauses following, it is not clear whether or not they are related to the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#8179;</font>. There are actually three possibilities for the referent of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#8179;</font> in 4:17: (1) it may refer to the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</font> clause which immediately follows, so that the love of believers is brought to perfection <i>in that</i> they have confidence in the day of judgment. The main problem with this interpretation is that since the day of judgment is still future, it necessitates understanding the second use of the preposition &#8220;in&#8221; (second <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957;</font> [<font face="Greektl">en</font>]) to mean &#8220;about&#8221; or &#8220;concerning&#8221; with reference to the day of judgment in order to make logical sense. (2) The <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#8179;</font> may refer to the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause in 4:17b, meaning &#8220;love is perfected with us&#8230;<i>in that</i> just as he [Christ] is, so also are we in this world.&#8221; This makes logical sense, and there are numerous cases where <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#8179;</font> is explained by a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause that follows. However, according to this understanding the intervening <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</font> clause is awkward, and there is no other instance of the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#8179;</font> explained by a following <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause where a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</font> clause intervenes between the two in this way. (3) Thus, the third possibility is that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#8179;</font> refers to what <i>precedes</i> in 4:16b, and this also would make logical sense: &#8220;By this &#8211; by our residing in love so that we reside in God and he resides in us &#8211; is love brought to perfection with us.&#8221; This has the additional advantage of agreeing precisely with what the author has already said in 4:12: &#8220;If we love one another, God remains in us and his love is brought to perfection in us.&#8221; Thus option (3) is best, with the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#8179;</font> referring to what precedes in 4:16b, and the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</font> clause which follows indicates the <i>result</i> of this perfection of love in believers: In the future day of judgment they will have confidence. The <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause would then give the <i>reason</i> for such confidence in the day of judgment: because just as Jesus is, so also are believers in this world &#8211; they are already currently in relationship with God just as Jesus is.</p>
