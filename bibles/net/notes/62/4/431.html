<A NAME="431"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=205><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;God resides in us&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#952;&#949;&#8056;&#962; &#7952;&#957; &#7969;&#956;&#8150;&#957; &#956;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#953;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Jo qeo&quot; en Jhmin menei</font>) in 4:12 is a reference to the permanent relationship which God has with the believer. Here it refers specifically to God&#8217;s indwelling of the believer in the person of the Holy Spirit, as indicated by 4:13b. Since it refers to state and not to change of status it is here translated &#8220;resides&#8221; (see 2:6).</p>
