<A NAME="48"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=182><b>tn</b> This forms part of the author&#8217;s christological confession which serves as a test of the spirits. Many interpreters have speculated that the author of 1 John is here correcting or adapting a slogan of the secessionist opponents, but there is no concrete evidence for this in the text. Such a possibility is mere conjecture (see R. E. Brown, <i>Epistles of John </i>[AB], 492). The phrase may be understood in a number of different ways, however: (1) the entire phrase &#8220;Jesus Christ come in the flesh&#8221; may be considered the single object of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001;&#956;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#949;&#8150;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jomologei</font>; so B. F. Westcott, A. Brooke, J. Bonsirven, R. E. Brown, S. Smalley, and others); (2) the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001;&#956;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#949;&#8150;</font> may be followed by a double accusative, so that both &#8220;Jesus Christ&#8221; and &#8220;come in the flesh&#8221; are objects of the verb; the meaning would be &#8220;confess Jesus Christ as come in the flesh&#8221; (so B. Weiss, J. Chaine, and others). (3) Another possibility is to see the verb as followed by a double accusative as in (2), but in this case the first object is &#8220;Jesus&#8221; and the second is &#8220;the Christ come in the flesh,&#8221; so that what is being confessed is &#8220;Jesus <i>as</i> the Christ come in the flesh&#8221; (so N. Alexander, J. Stott, J. Houlden, and others). All three options are grammatically possible, although not equally probable. Option (1) has a number of points in its favor: (a) the parallel in 2 John 7 suggests to some that the phrase should be understood as a single object; (b) option (2) makes &#8220;Jesus Christ&#8221; the name of the preincarnate second Person of the Trinity, and this would be the <i>only</i> place in the Johannine literature where such a designation for the preincarnate <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#923;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Logos</font>) occurs; and (c) option (3) would have been much clearer if <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#972;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Criston</font>) were accompanied by the article (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001;&#956;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#949;&#8150; &#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#957; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#972;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Jomologei Ihsoun ton Criston</font>). Nevertheless option (3) is preferred on the basis of the overall context involving the secessionist opponents: Their christological views would allow the confession of the Christ come in the flesh (perhaps in the sense of the Spirit indwelling believers, although this is hard to prove), but they would have trouble confessing that <i>Jesus</i> was (exclusively) the Christ incarnate. The author&#8217;s failure to repeat the qualifying phrases (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#7952;&#957; &#963;&#945;&#961;&#954;&#8054; &#7952;&#955;&#951;&#955;&#965;&#952;&#972;&#964;&#945;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Criston en sarki elhluqota</font>) in the negative repetition in 4:3a actually suggests that the stress is on <i>Jesus</i> as the confession the opponents could not or would not make. It is difficult to see how the parallel in 2 John 7 favors option (1), although R. E. Brown (<i>Epistles of John </i>[AB]<i>, </i>492) thinks it does. The related or parallel construction in John 9:22 (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#940;&#957; &#964;&#953;&#962; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#8001;&#956;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#8053;&#963;&#8131; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#972;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">ean ti&quot; auton Jomologhsh Criston</font>) provides further support for option (3). This is discounted by R. E. Brown because the verb in John 9:22 occurs between the two accusative objects rather than preceding both as here (<i>Epistles of John </i>[AB], 493 &#8211; although Brown does mention Rom 10:9 as another parallel closer in grammatical structure to 1 John 4:2). Brown does not mention the textual variants in John 9:22, however: Both <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>66</sup> and <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>75</sup> (along with K, <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13</sup> and others) read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001;&#956;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#8053;&#963;&#8131; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#972;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jomologhsh auton Criston</font>). This structure exactly parallels 1 John 4:2, and a case can be made that this is actually the preferred reading in John 9:22; furthermore, it is clear from the context in John 9:22 that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#972;&#957;</font> is the complement (what is predicated of the first accusative) since the object (the first accusative) is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#972;&#957;</font> rather than the proper name <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#957;</font>. The parallel in John 9:22 thus appears to be clearer than either 1 John 4:2 or 2 John 7, and thus to prove useful in understanding both the latter constructions.</p>
