<A NAME="427"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=201><b>sn</b> As explained at 2:2, inherent in the meaning of the word translated <i>atoning sacrifice </i>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7985;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#956;&#972;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Jilasmos</font>) is the idea of turning away the divine wrath, so that &#8220;propitiation&#8221; is the closest English equivalent. God&#8217;s love for us is expressed in his sending his Son to be the propitiation (the propitiatory sacrifice) for our sins on the cross. This is an indirect way for the author to allude to one of the main points of his controversy with the opponents: the significance for believers&#8217; salvation of Jesus&#8217; earthly life and ministry, including especially his sacrificial death on the cross. The contemporary English &#8220;atoning sacrifice&#8221; communicates this idea more effectively.</p>
