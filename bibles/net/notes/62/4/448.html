<A NAME="448"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=222><b>sn</b> No object is supplied for the verb <i>love</i> (the author with his propensity for obscurity has left it to the readers to supply the object). The obvious objects that could be supplied from the context are either God himself or other believers (the brethren). It may well be that the author has <i>both</i> in mind at this point; the statement is general enough to cover both alternatives, although the following verse puts more emphasis on love for the brethren.</p>
