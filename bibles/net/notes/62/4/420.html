<A NAME="420"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=194><b>tn</b> The author proclaims in 4:8 <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#952;&#949;&#8056;&#962; &#7936;&#947;&#940;&#960;&#951; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#943;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jo qeo&quot; agaph estin</font>), but from a grammatical standpoint this is not a proposition in which subject and predicate nominative are interchangeable (&#8220;God is love&#8221; does not equal &#8220;love is God&#8221;). The predicate noun is anarthrous, as it is in two other Johannine formulas describing God, &#8220;God is light&#8221; in 1 John 1:5 and &#8220;God is Spirit&#8221; in John 4:24. The anarthrous predicate suggests a qualitative force, not a mere abstraction, so that a quality of God&#8217;s character is what is described here.</p>
