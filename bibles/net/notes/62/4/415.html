<A NAME="415"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=189><b>tn</b> The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#959;&#965;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ek toutou</font>) in 4:6, which bears obvious similarity to the much more common phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#8179;</font> (<font face="Greektl">en toutw</font>), must refer to what precedes, since there is nothing in the following context for it to relate to, and 4:1-6 is recognized by almost everyone as a discrete unit. There is still a question, however, of <i>what</i> in the preceding context the phrase refers to. Interpreters have suggested a reference (1) only to 4:6; (2) to 4:4-6; or (3) to all of 4:1-6. The last is most likely, because the present phrase forms an inclusion with the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#8179;</font> in 3:24 which introduces the present section. Thus &#8220;by this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of deceit&#8221; refers to all of 4:1-6 with its &#8220;test&#8221; of the spirits by the christological confession made by their adherents in 4:1-3 and with its emphasis on the authoritative (apostolic) eyewitness testimony to the significance of Jesus&#8217; earthly life and ministry in 4:4-6.</p>
