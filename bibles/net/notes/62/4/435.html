<A NAME="435"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=209><b>sn</b> The genitive <i>of his Spirit</i> here, like the phrase in 3:24, probably reflects a partitive nuance, so that the author portrays God as &#8216;apportioning&#8217; his Spirit to individual believers. This leads to the important observation that the author is not particularly interested in emphasizing (1) the ongoing <i>interior</i> witness of the Holy Spirit (which is what the passage is often understood to mean) but is emphasizing (2) the <i>fact</i> that God has given the Spirit to believers, and it is this fact that gives believers assurance of their relationship to God. In other words, it is the <i>fact</i> that the Holy Spirit has been given to believers, rather than the ongoing interior testimony of the Holy Spirit within the believer, which is the primary source of the believer&#8217;s assurance.</p>
