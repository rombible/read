<A NAME="41"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=175><b>sn</b> <i>1 John 4:1-6. </i>These verses form one of three units within 1 John that almost all interpreters consider a single unit and do not divide up (the other two are 2:12-14 and 15-17). The subject matter is so clearly different from the surrounding context that these clearly constitute separate units of thought. Since the Holy Spirit is not the only spirit active in the world, the author needs to qualify for the recipients how to tell if a spirit comes from God. The &#8220;test&#8221; is the confession in 4:2.</p>
