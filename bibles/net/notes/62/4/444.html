Once more the author uses the pronoun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954;&#949;&#8150;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ekeinos</font>) to refer to Jesus Christ, as he did in 2:6; 3:3, 5, 7, and 16. A reference to Christ is confirmed in this context because the author says that &#8220;just as he is, so also are we [believers] <i>in this world</i>&#8221; and since 3:2 indicated that believers are to be like God in the future (but are not yet), the only one believers can be like already in the present age is Jesus Christ.</p>
