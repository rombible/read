<A NAME="439"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=213><b>tn</b> Both <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#947;&#957;&#8061;&#954;&#945;&#956;&#949;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">egnwkamen</font>) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#949;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#954;&#945;&#956;&#949;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pepisteukamen</font>) in 4:16 are perfect tenses, implying past actions with existing results. In this case the past action is specified as the recognition of (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#947;&#957;&#8061;&#954;&#945;&#956;&#949;&#957;</font>) and belief in (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#949;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#954;&#945;&#956;&#949;&#957;</font>) &#8220;the love which God has in us.&#8221; But what is the relationship between the two verbs <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#953;&#957;&#8061;&#963;&#954;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ginwskw</font>) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pisteuw</font>)? (1) Some interpreters would see a different nuance in each. (2) But in the Gospel of John the two verbs frequently occur together in the same context, often in the same tense; examples may be found in John 6:69, 8:31-32, 10:38, 14:7-10, and 17:8. They also occur together in one other context in 1 John, 4:1-2. Of these John 6:69, Peter&#8217;s confession, is the closest parallel to the usage here: &#8220;We have come to <i>believe</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#949;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#954;&#945;&#956;&#949;&#957;</font>] and to<i> know</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#947;&#957;&#8061;&#954;&#945;&#956;&#949;&#957;</font>] that you are the holy One of God.&#8221; Here the order between &#8220;knowing&#8221; and &#8220;believing&#8221; is reversed from 1 John 4:16, but an examination of the other examples from the Gospel of John should make it clear that there is no difference in meaning when the order of the terms is reversed. It appears that the author considered both terms to describe a single composite action. Thus they represent a hendiadys which describes an act of faith/belief/trust on the part of the individual; knowledge (true knowledge) is an inseparable part of this act of faith.</p>
