Although it is possible (2) to regard the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</font> as indicating result, the use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#959;&#964;&#945;&#960;&#8053;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">potaphn</font>, &#8220;what sort of&#8221;) to modify <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#947;&#940;&#960;&#951;&#957;</font> suggests that the idea of &#8220;love&#8221; will be qualified further in the following context, and this qualification is provided by the epexegetical <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</font> clause.</p>

There seems to be no theological reason to omit the words. This has all the earmarks of a classic case of homoioteleuton, for the preceding word (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#8182;&#956;&#949;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">klhqwmen</font>, &#8220;we should be called&#8221;) ends in -<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#949;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">-men</font>).</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> The indicative mood indicates that the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#963;&#956;&#941;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">esmen</font>) at the end of 3:1a is not governed by the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jina</font>) and does not belong with the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</font> clause, since this would have required a subjunctive. If the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#963;&#956;&#941;&#957;</font> were subjunctive, the force of the clause would be &#8220;that we should be called children of God, and be (children of God).&#8221; With <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#963;&#956;&#941;&#957;</font> as indicative, the clause reads &#8220;that we should be called children of God, and indeed we are (children of God).&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="34"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=97><b>tn</b> Lexically it is clear that this phrase indicates reason, but what is not clear is whether (1) <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959;</font> (<font face="Greektl">touto</font>) refers to what follows, (2) to what precedes, or (3) to both (as with the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959;</font> [<font face="Greektl">en touto</font>] phrases throughout 1 John). <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#916;&#953;&#8048; &#964;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959;</font> (<font face="Greektl">dia touto</font>) occurs 15 times in the Gospel of John, and a pattern emerges which is so consistent that it appears to be the key to the usage here. Six times in the Gospel of John (5:16, 18; 8:47; 10:17; 12:18, 39) the phrase refers to what follows, and in each of these instances an epexegetical <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joti</font>) clause follows. Nine times in John (1:31, 6:65, 7:21-22, 9:23, 12:27, 13:11, 15:19, 16:15, 19:11) the phrase refers to what precedes, and in none of these instances is it followed by a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause. The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#8048; &#964;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959;</font> is used three times in the Johannine Epistles. In two of these (1 John 4:5, 3 John 10) there is no <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause following, and so the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#8048; &#964;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959;</font> should refer to preceding material. Here in 3:1 there is an epexegetical <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause following, so the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#8048; &#964;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959;</font> should (unless it is the only exception in the Gospel of John and the Johannine Epistles) refer to what follows, that is, to the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause itself. This is indicated by the colon in the translation.</p>

Additions of coordinating conjunctions such as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> are predictable variants; this coupled with the poor external credentials suggests that this addition is not likely to be original.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> The relationship of 3:2b to 3:2a is difficult. It seems best to regard this as a case of asyndeton, although the Byzantine text, the Syriac Peshitta, the Bohairic Coptic, and some <sc>mss of the Sahidic Coptic supply <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> (<font face="Greektl">de</font>) after <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#7988;&#948;&#945;&#956;&#949;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">oidamen</font>) in 3:2b. This addition is not likely to be original, but it does reflect a tendency among scribes to see an adversative (contrastive) relationship between 3:2a and 3:2b. This seems to be an accurate understanding of the relationship between the clauses from a logical standpoint: &#8220;and what we shall be has not yet been revealed; <i>but</i> we know that whenever he should be revealed, we shall be like him.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="38"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=101><b>tn</b> The first <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joti</font>) in 3:2 follows <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#7988;&#948;&#945;&#956;&#949;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">oidamen</font>), a verb of perception, and introduces an indirect discourse clause which specifies the <i>content</i> of what believers know: &#8220;that whenever it should be revealed, we shall be like him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="39"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=102><b>tn</b> In this context <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#940;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ean</font>) does not indicate (1) uncertainty about <i>whether or not</i> what believers will be shall be revealed, but rather (2) uncertainty about the exact <i>time</i> the event will take place. In the Koine period <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#940;&#957;</font> can mean &#8220;when&#8221; or &#8220;whenever&#8221; and is virtually the equivalent of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#945;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jotan</font>; see BDAG 268 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#940;&#957;</font> 2). It has this meaning in John 12:32 and 14:3. Thus the phrase here should be translated, &#8220;we know that whenever it is revealed.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="310"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=103><b>tn</b> Many take the understood subject (&#8220;he&#8221;) of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#966;&#945;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#969;&#952;&#8135;</font> (<font face="Greektl">fanerwqh</font>) as a reference to Jesus Christ, because the same verb was used in 2:28 in reference to the parousia (second advent). In the immediate context, however, a better analogy is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#966;&#945;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#8061;&#952;&#951; &#964;&#943; &#7952;&#963;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#952;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">efanerwqh ti esomeqa</font>) in 3:2a. There the clause <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#943; &#7952;&#963;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#952;&#945;</font> is the subject of the passive verb: &#8220;<i>what we shall be</i> has not yet been revealed.&#8221; From a grammatical standpoint it makes better sense to see the understood subject of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#966;&#945;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#969;&#952;&#8135;</font> as &#8220;it&#8221; rather than &#8220;he&#8221; and as referring back to the clause <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#943; &#7952;&#963;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#952;&#945;</font> in 3:2a. In the context this makes good sense: &#8220;Beloved, now we are children of God, and <i>what we shall be</i> has not yet been revealed. We know that whenever <i>it shall be revealed</i>, we shall be like him, because we shall see him just as he is.&#8221; This emphasizes the contrast in the verse between the present state (&#8220;not yet been revealed&#8221;) and the future state (&#8220;shall be revealed&#8221;) of believers, and this will of course take place at the parousia.</p>
<A NAME="311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=104><b>sn</b> <i>Is revealed. </i>It may well be that the use of the same passive verb here (from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#966;&#945;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#972;&#969;</font>, <font face="Greektl">fanerow</font>) is intended to suggest to the reader the mention of the parousia (Christ&#8217;s second coming) in 2:28.</p>
<A NAME="312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=105><b>tn</b> The second <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joti</font>) in 3:2 is best understood as causal, giving the reason why believers will be like God: &#8220;we shall be like him, <i>because</i> we shall see him just as he is.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=106><b>sn</b> The phrase <i>we will be like him, because we will see him just as he is</i> has been explained two ways: (1) believers will really become more like God than they now are, and will do this through seeing God as he really is; or (2) believers will realize that they are already like God, but did not realize it until they see him as he is. One who sees a strong emphasis on realized eschatology in the Gospel of John and the Epistles might opt for the second view, since it downplays the difference between what believers already are in the present age and what they will become in the next. It seems better, though, in light of the statement in 3:2a that &#8220;what we will be has not yet been revealed&#8221; and because of the reference to Christ&#8217;s parousia in 2:28, that the author intends to distinguish between the present state of believers and what they will be like in the future. Thus the first view is better, that believers really will become more like God than they are now, as a result of seeing him as he really is.</p>
<A NAME="314"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=107><b>tn</b> &#8220;Focused&#8221; is not in the Greek text, but is supplied for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="315"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=108><b>sn</b> The verb translated <i>purifies</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7937;&#947;&#957;&#943;&#950;&#969;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Jagnizw</font>) is somewhat unusual here, since it is not common in the NT, and occurs only once in the Gospel of John (11:55). One might wonder why the author did not use the more common verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7937;&#947;&#953;&#940;&#950;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jagiazw</font>), as in John 17:19, where Jesus prays, &#8220;On their behalf I consecrate myself, so that they may also be consecrated in the truth.&#8221; It is possible that there is some overlap between the two verbs and thus this is another example of Johannine stylistic variation, but the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7937;&#947;&#957;&#943;&#950;&#969;</font> is used in the context of John 11:55, which describes ritual purification for the Passover, a usage also found in the LXX (Exod 19:10-11, Num 8:21). In this context the use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7937;&#947;&#957;&#943;&#950;&#969;</font> would remind the readers that, if they have the future hope of entering the Father&#8217;s presence (&#8220;seeing him as he is&#8221; in 3:2), they need to prepare themselves by living a purified lifestyle now, just as Jesus lived during his earthly life and ministry (cf. 2:6 again). This serves to rebut the opponents&#8217; claims to moral indifference, that what the Christian does in the present life is of no consequence.</p>
<A NAME="316"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=109><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;that one.&#8221; Context indicates a reference to Jesus here. The switch from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">autos</font>) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ekeinos</font>) parallels 1 John 2:6 (see note there). Since purity of life is mentioned in the context, this almost certainly refers to <i>Jesus</i> in his earthly life and ministry as the example believers should imitate (a major theme of the author throughout 1 John).</p>
<A NAME="317"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=110><b>sn</b> <i>1 John 3:1-3. </i>All of 3:1-3 is a parenthesis within the present section in which the author reflects on what it means to be fathered by God, a subject he has mentioned at the end of 2:29. The sequence of the argument is then resumed by 3:4, which is in opposition to 2:29.</p>
<A NAME="318"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=111><b>sn</b> <i>Everyone who practices sin. </i>In contrast to the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#8118;&#962; &#8001;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pas Jo</font>) + participle construction in 3:3 (<i>everyone who has</i>, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#8118;&#962; &#8001; &#7956;&#967;&#969;&#957;</font> [<font face="Greektl">pas Jo ecwn</font>]) which referred to believers, the use of <i>everyone who practices sin</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#8118;&#962; &#8001; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#8182;&#957; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7937;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#943;&#945;&#957;</font> [<font face="Greektl">pas Jo poiwn thn Jamartian</font>]) here refers to the author&#8217;s opponents. A similar use, referring to the opponents&#8217; denial of the Son, is found in 2:23.</p>
<A NAME="319"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=112><b>sn</b> The Greek word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#943;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anomia</font>) is often translated &#8220;iniquity&#8221; or &#8220;lawlessness&#8221; and in the LXX refers particularly to transgression of the law of Moses. In Jewish thought the ideas of sin (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7937;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#943;&#945;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Jamartia</font>) and lawlessness or iniquity (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#943;&#945;</font>) were often equated because sin involved a violation of the Mosaic law and hence lawlessness. For example, Ps 51:5 LXX sets the two in parallel, and Paul in Rom 4:7 (quoting Ps 32:1) does the same. For the author, it is not violation of the Mosaic law that results in lawlessness, since he is writing to Christians. The &#8216;law&#8217; for the author is the law of love, as given by Jesus in the new commandment of John 13:34-35. This is the command to love one&#8217;s brother, a major theme of 1 John and the one specific sin in the entire letter which the opponents are charged with (3:17). Since the author has already labeled the opponents &#8220;antichrists&#8221; in 2:18, it may well be that he sees in their iniquitous behavior of withdrawing from the community and refusing to love the brethren a foreshadowing of the apocalyptic iniquity of the end times (cf. 2 Thess 2:3-8). In Matt 24:11-12 Jesus foretold that false prophets would arise in the end times (cf. 1 John 4:1), that lawlessness (<font face="Greektl">anomia</font>) would increase, and that &#8220;the love of many will grow cold&#8221; (which would certainly fit the author&#8217;s portrait of the opponents here).</p>

<A NAME="321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=114><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;that one.&#8221; The context makes it clear that this is a reference to Jesus, because the reader is told &#8220;he was revealed in order that he might take away sins.&#8221; The connection with Jesus as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world in John 1:29 provides additional confirmation that the previous use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954;&#949;&#8150;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ekeinos</font>) in 3:3b should also be understood as a reference to Jesus, as 2:6 was.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b><i> </i>In Johannine thought it is <i>Jesus</i>, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world (John 1:29).</p>

<A NAME="323"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=116><b>tn</b> Here the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#941;&#957;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">menw</font>) refers to the permanence of relationship between Jesus and the believer, as in 2:27 and 2:28. It is clear that Jesus is the referent of the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183;</font> (<font face="Greektl">en autw</font>) because he is the subject of the discussion in v. 5.</p>
<A NAME="324"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=117><b>tn</b> The interpretive problem raised by the use of the present tense <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7937;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#940;&#957;&#949;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jamartanei</font>) in this verse (and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#959;&#953;&#949;&#8150;</font> [<font face="Greektl">poiei</font>] in 3:9 as well) is that (a) it appears to teach a sinless state of perfection for the true Christian, and (b) it appears to contradict the author&#8217;s own statements in 2:1-2 where he acknowledged that Christians do indeed sin. (1) One widely used method of reconciling the acknowledgment in 2:1-2 that Christians do sin with the statements in 3:6 and 3:9 that they do not is expressed by M. Zerwick (<i>Biblical Greek</i> §251). He understands the aorist to mean &#8220;commit sin in the concrete, commit some sin or other&#8221; while the present means &#8220;be a sinner, as a characteristic «state».&#8221; N. Turner (<i>Grammatical Insights</i>, 151) argues essentially the same as Zerwick, stating that the present tense <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7937;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#940;&#957;&#949;&#953;</font> is stative (be a sinner) while the aorist is ingressive (begin to be a sinner, as the initial step of committing this or that sin). Similar interpretations can be found in a number of grammatical works and commentaries. (2) Others, however, have questioned the view that the distinction in tenses alone can convey a &#8220;habitual&#8221; meaning without further contextual clarification, including C. H. Dodd (<i>The Johannine Epistles</i> [MNTC], 79) and Z. C. Hodges (&#8220;1 John,&#8221; <i>BKCNT</i>, 894). B. Fanning (<i>Verbal Aspect</i> [OTM], 215-17) has concluded that the habitual meaning for the present tense cannot be ruled out, because there are clear instances of habitual presents in the NT where other clarifying words are not present and the habitual sense is derived from the context alone. This means that from a grammatical standpoint alone, the habitual present cannot be ruled out in 1 John 3:6 and 9. It is still true, however, that it would have been much clearer if the author had reinforced the habitual sense with clarifying words or phrases in 1 John 3:6 and 9 if that is what he had intended. Dodd&#8217;s point, that reliance on the distinction in tenses alone is quite a subtle way of communicating such a vital point in the author&#8217;s argument, is still valid. It may also be added that the author of 1 John has demonstrated a propensity for alternating between present and aorist tenses for purely stylistic reasons (see 2:12).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Does not sin. </i>It is best to view the distinction between &#8220;everyone who practices sin&#8221; in 3:4 and &#8220;everyone who resides in him&#8221; in 3:6 as absolute and sharply in contrast. The author is here making a clear distinction between the opponents, who as moral indifferentists downplay the significance of sin in the life of the Christian, and the readers, who as true Christians recognize the significance of sin because Jesus came to take it away (3:5) and to destroy it as a work of the devil (3:8). This argument is developed more fully by S. Kubo (&#8220;I John 3:9: Absolute or Habitual?&#8221; <i>AUSS </i>7 [1969]: 47-56), who takes the opponents as Gnostics who define sin as ignorance. The opponents were probably not adherents of fully developed gnosticism, but Kubo is right that <i>the distinction between their position and that of the true Christian is intentionally portrayed by the author here as a sharp antithesis</i>. This explanation still has to deal with the contradiction between 2:1-2 and 3:6-9, but this does not present an insuperable difficulty. The author of 1 John has repeatedly demonstrated a tendency to present his ideas antithetically, in &#8220;either/or&#8221; terms, in order to bring out for the readers the drastic contrast between themselves as true believers and the opponents as false believers. In 2:1-2 the author can acknowledge the possibility that a true Christian might on occasion sin, because in this context he wishes to reassure his readers that the statements he has made about the opponents in the preceding context do not apply to them. But in 3:4-10, his concern is to bring out the absolute difference between the opponents and his readers, so he speaks in theoretical rather than practical terms which do not discuss the possible occasional exception, because to do so would weaken his argument.</p>

A concept of evildoers as &#8220;fathered&#8221; by the devil in the same sense as Christians are fathered by God would imply a much more fully developed Gnosticism with its dualistic approach to humanity. The author of 1 John carefully avoids saying that the opponents are &#8220;fathered by the devil,&#8221; because in Johannine theology not to be fathered by God is to be fathered only by the flesh (John 1:13). This is a significant piece of evidence that 1 John predates the more fully developed Gnosticism of the 2nd century.

Although R. E.

But the relationship between loving one&#8217;s fellow Christian (<i>Grk </i>&#8220;brother&#8221;) and possessing eternal life goes <i>beyond</i> a proof or external test. Our love for our fellow Christians is in fact a form of God&#8217;s love for us because as far as the author of 1 John is concerned, <i>all love comes from God</i> (cf. 4:7-11). Therefore he can add the next line of 3:14, &#8220;the one who does not love remains in death.&#8221; Why? Because such a person does not have God&#8217;s love residing in them at all.

This was the first incident of murder in human history and also the first outward demonstration of the full implications of sin&#8217;s entry into the world. Ultimately, then, the devil is behind murder, just as he was behind Cain&#8217;s murder of Abel. When the hater kills, he shows himself to be a child of the devil (cf. 1 John 3:10).

To speak in terms of eternal life not &#8220;residing&#8221; in such an individual is not to imply that at some time in the past this person did possess eternal life and subsequently lost it, however.

This is the only specific moral fault he ever charges the opponents with in the entire letter.

This person, from the author&#8217;s dualistic &#8216;either/or&#8217; perspective, <i>cannot</i> be a believer. The semantic force of the deliberative rhetorical question, &#8220;How can the love of God reside in such a person?&#8221;, is therefore a declarative statement about the spiritual condition of the opponents: &#8220;The love of God cannot possibly reside in such a person.&#8221;</p>

Although it may be agreed that the term generally refers to the &#8220;center and source of the whole inner life, w. its thinking, feeling, and volition&#8221; (BDAG 508 s.v. l.b), this may be further subdivided into references to (a) &#8220;the faculty of thought&#8230;as the organ of natural and spiritual enlightenment,&#8221; that is, the mind; (b) &#8220;the will and its decisions&#8221;; (c) &#8220;the emotions, wishes, desires,&#8221; i.e., the emotions or feelings; or (d) &#8220;moral decisions, the moral life,&#8221; that is, the part of the individual where moral decisions are made, which is commonly called the conscience. Thus <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#961;&#948;&#943;&#945;</font> in 3:19 could refer to either the mind, the will, the emotions, or the conscience, and it is not transparently clear which concept the author has primarily in view.

<A NAME="377"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">77</span><note=170><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#941;&#957;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">menw</font>) has been translated &#8220;resides&#8221; here because this verse refers to the mutual and reciprocal relationship between God and the believer.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The verb <i>resides</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#941;&#957;&#969;</font>, <font face="Greektl">menw</font>) here and again in the second clause of 3:24 refers to the permanence of relationship between God and the believer, as also in 2:6; 4:12, 13, 15, and 16 (3x).</p>

<A NAME="380"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">80</span><note=173><b>tn</b> Once again there is the (by now familiar) question of whether the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#8179;</font> (<font face="Greektl">en toutw</font>) refers to what precedes or to what follows.
