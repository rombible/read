<a name="14"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=4><b>tn</b> In the Greek text the prologue to 1 John (vv. 1-4) makes up a single sentence. This is awkward in Greek, and a literal translation produces almost impossible English. For this reason the present translation places a period at the end of v. 2 and another at the end of v. 3. The material in parentheses in v. 1 begins the first of <i>three</i> parenthetical interruptions in the grammatical sequence of the prologue (the second is the entirety of v. 2 and the third is the latter part of v. 3). This is because of the awkwardness of connecting the prepositional phrase with what precedes, an awkwardness not immediately obvious in most English translations: &#8220;what we beheld and our hands handled concerning the word of life&#8230;&#8221; As J. Bonsirven (<i>Épîtres de Saint Jean </i>[CNT], 67) noted, while one may <i>hear</i> about the word of life, it is more difficult to <i>see</i> about the word of life, and impossible to <i>feel</i> with one&#8217;s hands about the word of life. Rather than being the <i>object</i> of any of the verbs in v. 1, the prepositional phrase at the end of v. 1 (&#8220;concerning the word of life&#8230;&#8221;) is more likely a parenthetical clarification intended to specify the <i>subject</i> of the eyewitness testimony which the verbs in v. 1 describe. A parallel for such parenthetical explanation may be found in John 1:12 (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#949;&#7984;&#962; &#964;&#8056; &#8004;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#945; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</font>, <font face="Greektl">toi&quot; pisteuousin ei&quot; to onoma autou</font>).</p>
