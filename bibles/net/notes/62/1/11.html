<a name="11"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;This is what we proclaim to you&#8221; is not in the Greek text, but has been supplied to clarify the English. The main verb which governs all of these relative clauses is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#945;&#947;&#947;&#941;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">apangellomen</font>) in v. 3. This is important for the proper understanding of the relative clauses in v. 1, because the main verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#960;&#945;&#947;&#947;&#941;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957;</font> in v. 3 makes it clear that all of the relative clauses in vv. 1 and 3 are the <i>objects</i> of the author&#8217;s proclamation to the readers rather than the <i>subjects</i>. To indicate this the phrase &#8220;This is what we proclaim to you&#8221; has been supplied at the beginning of v. 1.</p>
