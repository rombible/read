<A NAME="277"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">77</span><note=88><b>tn</b> Again, as at the end of 2:27, the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#949;</font> (<font face="Greektl">menete</font>) may be read as either (1) indicative or (2) imperative mood. At the end of 2:27 the translation opted for an indicative because the author had been attempting to reassure his readers that they did indeed possess eternal life, and also because an indicative at the end of 2:27 balances the indicative reference to the &#8220;anointing&#8221; residing in the readers at the beginning of the verse. With the return in 2:28 to the eschatological note introduced in 2:18, however, it appears that the author switches from reassurance to exhortation. At the time he is writing them, the readers do still &#8220;remain&#8221; since they have not yet adopted the heretical teaching of the opponents. But now the author wants to forestall the possibility that they might do so at some point, and so he begins this section with an exhortation to the readers to &#8220;reside/remain&#8221; in Christ. This suggests that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#949;</font> in the present verse should be read as imperative rather than indicative, a view made even more probable by the following <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jina</font>) clause which states the purpose for the exhortation: in order that at the parousia (second advent) when Jesus Christ is revealed, the readers may have confidence and not shrink back from him in shame when he appears.</p>
