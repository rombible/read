<A NAME="24"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=15><b>tn</b> The referent of the pronoun &#8220;him&#8221; is not entirely clear in the Greek text; it could be either (1) God the Father, or (2) Jesus Christ, both of whom are mentioned at the end of v. 3. A reference to Jesus Christ is more likely because this is the nearest possible antecedent, and because God (the Father) is specifically mentioned in the following clause in v. 5.</p>
