<A NAME="282"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">82</span><note=93><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#949;&#957;&#957;&#940;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">gennaw</font>) presents a translation problem: (1) should the passive be translated archaically &#8220;be begotten&#8221; (the action of the male parent; see BDAG 193 s.v. 1.a) or (2) should it be translated &#8220;be born&#8221; (as from a female parent; see BDAG 194 s.v. 2)? A number of modern translations (RSV, NASB, NIV) have opted for the latter, but (3) the imagery expressed in 1 John 3:9 clearly refers to the action of the male parent in procreating a child, as does 5:1 (&#8220;everyone who loves the father loves the child fathered by him&#8221;), and so a word reflecting the action of the male parent is called for here. The contemporary expression &#8220;fathered by&#8221; captures this idea.</p>
