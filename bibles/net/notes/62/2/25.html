<A NAME="25"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=16><b>tn</b> The key to understanding the first major section of 1 John, 1:5-3:10, is found in the statement in v. 5: &#8220;<i>God is light and in him there is no darkness at all</i>.&#8221; The idea of &#8220;proclamation&#8221; &#8211; the apostolic proclamation of eyewitness testimony which the prologue introduces (1:2, 3) &#8211; is picked up in 1:5 by the use of the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#943;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">angelia</font>) and the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#945;&#947;&#947;&#941;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anangellomen</font>), cognate to the verb in 1:3. The content of this proclamation is given by the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joti</font>) clause in 1:5 as the assertion that God is light, so this statement should be understood as the author&#8217;s formulation of the apostolic eyewitness testimony introduced in the prologue. (This corresponds to the apostolic preaching elsewhere referred to as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#8053;&#961;&#965;&#947;&#956;&#945;</font> [<font face="Greektl">khrugma</font>], although the term the Apostle John uses here is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#943;&#945;</font>.)</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Following the theme statement in 1:5, <i>God is light and in him there is no darkness at all</i>, the author presents a series of three claims and counterclaims that make up the first unit of 1 John (1:5-2:2). The three claims begin with &#8220;if&#8221; (1:6, 8, 10) and the three counterclaims begin with &#8220;but if&#8221; (1:7, 9; 2:1).</p>
