<A NAME="237"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=48><b>tn</b> The third person pronoun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183;</font> (<font face="Greektl">autw</font>) could refer either (1) to the person who loves his brother or (2) to the light itself which has no cause for stumbling &#8220;in it.&#8221; The following verse (2:11) views darkness as operative within a person, and the analogy with Ps 119:165, which says that the person who loves God&#8217;s law does not stumble, expresses a similar concept in relation to an individual. This evidence suggests that the person is the referent here.</p>
