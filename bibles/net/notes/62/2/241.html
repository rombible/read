<A NAME="241"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=52><b>tn</b> The <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joti</font>) that follows all six occurrences of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#961;&#940;&#966;&#969;</font>/<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#947;&#961;&#945;&#968;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">grafw</font>/<font face="Greektl">egraya</font>) in 2:12-14 can be understood as introducing either (1) a causal clause or (2) a content clause (if content, it could be said to introduce a direct object clause or an indirect discourse clause). Many interpreters have favored a causal translation, so that in each of the six cases what follows the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> gives the reason why the author is writing to the recipients. Usage in similar constructions is not decisive because only one other instance of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#961;&#940;&#966;&#969;</font> followed by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> occurs in 1 John (2:21), and that context is just as ambiguous as this one. On other occasions <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#961;&#940;&#966;&#969;</font> does tend to be followed by a noun or pronoun functioning as direct object. This might argue for the content usage here, but it could also be argued that the direct object in the six instances in these verses is understood, namely, the content of the entire letter itself. Thus the following <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause could still be causal. Grammatical considerations aside, these uses of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> are more likely introducing content clauses here rather than causal clauses because such a meaning better fits the context. If the uses of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> are understood as causal, it is difficult to see why the author immediately gives a warning in the section that follows about loving the world. The confidence he has expressed in his readers (if the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clauses are understood as causal) would appear to be ill-founded if he is so concerned about their relationship to the world as 2:15-17 seems to indicate. On the other hand, understanding the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clauses as content clauses fits very well the context of reassurance which runs throughout the letter.</p>
