<A NAME="276"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">76</span><note=87><b>tn</b> The verb may be read as either (1) indicative or (2) imperative mood. The same verb is found in the following verse, 2:28, but the address to the readers there seems clearly to indicate an imperative. On analogy some have called for an imperative here, but others have seen this as suggesting an indicative here, so that the author is not repeating himself. An indicative is slightly more likely here. Up to this point the thrust of the author has been reassurance rather than exhortation, and an indicative here (&#8220;&#8230;you reside in him&#8221;) balances the indicative in the first part of 2:27 (&#8220;the anointing which you received from him resides in you&#8230;&#8221;). With the following verse the author switches from reassurance (the readers at the time he is writing still &#8216;remain&#8217;; they have not yet adopted the teaching of the opponents) to exhortation (he is writing so that they will &#8216;remain&#8217; and not succumb to the deception of the opponents).</p>
