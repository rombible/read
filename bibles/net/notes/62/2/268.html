<A NAME="268"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">68</span><note=79><b>sn</b> The promise consists of <i>eternal life</i>, but it is also related to the concept of &#8220;remaining&#8221; in 2:24. The person who &#8220;remains in the Son and in the Father&#8221; thus has this promise of eternal life from Jesus himself. Consistent with this, 1 John 5:12 implies that the believer has this eternal life <i>now</i>, not just in the future, and this in turn agrees with John 5:24.</p>
