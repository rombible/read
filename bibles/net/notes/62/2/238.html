<A NAME="238"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=49><b>sn</b> <i>The one who hates his fellow Christian. </i>The author&#8217;s paradigm for the opponents portrays them as those who show hatred for fellow Christians (<i>Grk </i>&#8220;brothers,&#8221; but not referring to one&#8217;s physical siblings). This charge will be much more fully developed in chap. 3, where the author will compare the opponents to Cain (who is the model for one who hates a brother, since he ultimately murdered his own brother). In 1 John 3:17 the specific charge against the opponents will be failing to give material aid to a brother in need.</p>
