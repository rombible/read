<A NAME="247"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=58><b>sn</b> The versification of vv. 13 and 14 (so also NAB, NRSV, NLT) follows that of the NA<sup>27</sup> and UBS<sup>4</sup> editions of the Greek text. Some English translations, however, break the verses between the sentence addressed to children and the sentence addressed to fathers (KJV, NKJV, NASB, NIV). The same material has been translated in each case; the only difference is the versification of that material.</p>
