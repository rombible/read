<A NAME="215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=26><b>tn</b> There is some dispute over the significance of the aorist tense of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7937;&#956;&#940;&#961;&#964;&#951;&#964;&#949;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jamarthte</font>): (1) F. Stagg (&#8220;Orthodoxy and Orthopraxy in the Johannine Epistles,&#8221; <i>RevExp </i>67 [1970]:423-32, esp. 428) holds that the aorist is nondescriptive, saying nothing about the nature of the action itself, but only that the action has happened. This is indeed the normal aspectual value of the aorist tense in general, but there is some disagreement over whether with this particular verb there are more specific nuances of meaning. (2) M. Zerwick (<i>Biblical Greek</i> §251) and N. Turner (MHT 3:72) agree that the <i>present</i> tense of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7937;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#940;&#957;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jamartanw</font>) means &#8220;to be in a state of sin&#8221; (i.e., a sinner) while the <i>aorist</i> refers to specific acts of sin. Without attempting to sort out this particular dispute, it should be noted that certain verbs do have different nuances of meaning in different tenses, nuances which do not derive solely from the aspectual value of the tense per se, but from a combination of semantic factors which vary from word to word.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>So that you may not sin. </i>It is clear the author is <i>not</i> simply exhorting the readers not to be habitual or repetitive sinners, as if to imply that occasional acts of sin would be acceptable. The purpose of the author here is that the readers not sin <i>at all</i>, just as Jesus told the man he healed in John 5:14 &#8220;Don&#8217;t sin any more.&#8221;</p>
