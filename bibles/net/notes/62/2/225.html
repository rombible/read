<A NAME="225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=36><b>tn</b> The Greek verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#941;&#957;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">menw</font>) is commonly translated into contemporary English as &#8220;remain&#8221; or &#8220;abide,&#8221; but both of these translations have some problems: (1) &#8220;Abide&#8221; has become in some circles almost a &#8220;technical term&#8221; for some sort of special intimate fellowship or close relationship between the Christian and God, so that one may speak of Christians who are &#8220;abiding&#8221; and Christians who are not. It is accurate to say the word indicates a close, intimate (and permanent) relationship between the believer and God. However, it is very important to note that for the author of the Gospel of John and the Johannine Epistles <i>every </i>genuine Christian has this type of relationship with God, and the person who does not have this type of relationship (cf. 2 John 9) is not a believer at all (in spite of what he or she may claim). (2) On the other hand, to translate <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#941;&#957;&#969;</font> as &#8220;remain&#8221; removes some of these problems, but creates others: In certain contexts, such a translation can give the impression that those who currently &#8220;remain&#8221; in this relationship with God can at some point choose not to &#8220;remain&#8221;, that is, to abandon their faith and return to an unsaved condition. While one may easily think in terms of the author&#8217;s opponents in 1 John as not &#8220;remaining,&#8221; the author makes it inescapably clear in 2:19 that these people, in spite of their claims to know God and be in fellowship with God, <i>never</i> really were genuine believers. (3) In an attempt to avoid both these misconceptions, this translation renders <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#941;&#957;&#969;</font> as &#8220;reside&#8221; <i>except</i> in cases where the context indicates that &#8220;remain&#8221; is a more accurate nuance, that is, in contexts where a specific change of status or movement from one position to another is in view.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The Greek word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#941;&#957;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">menw</font>) translated <i>resides</i> indicates a close, intimate (and permanent) relationship between the believer and God.
