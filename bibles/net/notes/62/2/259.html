<A NAME="259"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=70><b>tn</b> The interpretation of the three <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clauses in v. 21 is very difficult: (1) All three instances of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joti</font>) may be causal (so NASB, NIV, NEB). (2) The first two may be causal while the third indicates content (declarative or recitative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font>, so KJV, RSV, TEV, NRSV). (3) However, it is best to take all three instances as indicating content because this allows all three to be subordinate to the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#947;&#961;&#945;&#968;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">egraya</font>) as compound direct objects. The author writes to reassure his readers (a) that they do indeed know the truth (first two uses of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font>) and (b) that no lie is of the truth (third use).</p>
