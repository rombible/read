<A NAME="29"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=20><b>tn</b> BDAG 50 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7937;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#943;&#945;</font> 1 defines this term as &#8220;a departure fr. either human or divine standards of uprightness&#8221; (see 1 John 5:17 where <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7937;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#943;&#945;</font> [<font face="Greektl">Jamartia</font>] and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#948;&#953;&#954;&#943;&#945;</font> [<font face="Greektl">adikia</font>] are related). This word occurs 17 times in 1 John, of which 11 are singular and 6 are plural.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>From all sin. </i>Sometimes a distinction between singular &#8220;sin&#8221; and plural &#8220;sins&#8221; has been suggested: Some would see the singular <i>all sin</i> of 1:7 as a reference to sinfulness before conversion and the plural <i>sins</i> of 1:9 as a reference to sins committed after one became a Christian. This amounts to making 1:7 refer to initial justification and 1:9 to sanctification. But the phrase <i>all sin </i>in 1:7 is so comprehensive that it can hardly be limited to preconversion sins, and the emphasis on &#8220;walking&#8221; in 1:7 strongly suggests that the Christian life is in view (not one&#8217;s life before conversion). In 1 John 1:8 sin appears as a condition or characteristic quality, which in 1:10 is regarded as universal. Apart from forgiveness in Christ it results in alienation from God (2:15) and spiritual death (3:14). But according to 1 John 1:7, cleansing from sin is possible by the blood (representing the sacrificial death) of Jesus.</p>
