<A NAME="264"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=75><b>tn</b> The word translated &#8220;remain&#8221; may also be translated &#8220;reside&#8221; (3 times in 2:24). See also the notes on the translation of the Greek verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#941;&#957;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">menw</font>) in 2:6 and in 2:19. Here the word can really have both nuances of &#8220;residing&#8221; and &#8220;remaining&#8221; and it is impossible for the English reader to catch both nuances if the translation provides only one. This occurs three times in 2:24.</p>
