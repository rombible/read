<A NAME="214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=25><b>sn</b> <i>My little children. </i>The direct address by the author to his readers at the beginning of 2:1 marks a break in the pattern of the opponents&#8217; claims (indicated by the phrase <i>if we say </i>followed by a negative statement in the apodosis, the &#8220;then&#8221; clause) and the author&#8217;s counterclaims (represented by <i>if</i> with a positive statement in the apodosis) made so far in 1:6-10. The seriousness of this last claim (in 1:10) causes the author to interrupt himself to address the readers as his faithful children and to explain to them that while he wants them not to sin, they may be assured that if they do, they can look to Jesus Christ, as their advocate with the Father, to intercede for them. After this, the last of the author&#8217;s three counter-claims in 1:5-2:2 is found in the <i>if </i>clause in 2:1b.</p>
