<A NAME="216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=27><b>tn</b> The description of the Holy Spirit as &#8220;Paraclete&#8221; is unique to the Gospel of John (14:16, 26; 15:26; and 16:7). Here, in the only other use of the word in the NT, it is Jesus, not the Spirit, who is described as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#940;&#954;&#955;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">paraklhto&quot;</font>). The reader should have been prepared for this interchangeability of terminology, however, by John 14:16, where Jesus told the disciples that he would ask the Father to send them &#8216;another&#8217; paraclete (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">allos</font>, &#8220;another of the same kind&#8221;). This implies that <i>Jesus himself had been a paraclete</i> in his earthly ministry to the disciples. This does not answer all the questions about the meaning of the word here, though, since it is not Jesus&#8217; role as an advocate during his earthly ministry which is in view, but his role as an advocate in heaven before the Father. The context suggests intercession in the sense of legal advocacy, as stress is placed upon the righteousness of Jesus (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#957; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#948;&#943;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Ihsoun Criston dikaion</font>). The concept of Jesus&#8217; intercession on behalf of believers does occur elsewhere in the NT, notably in Rom 8:34 and Heb 7:25. Something similar is taking place here, and is the best explanation of 1 John 2:1. An English translation like &#8220;advocate&#8221; or &#8220;intercessor&#8221; conveys this.</p>
