<A NAME="233"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=44><b>sn</b> The reference to <i>the darkness&#8230;passing away and the true light&#8230;already shining </i>is an allusion to John 1:5, 1:9, and 8:12. Because the author sees the victory of <i>light</i> over <i>darkness</i> as something already begun, he is writing Jesus&#8217; commandment to love one another to the readers as a reminder to (1) hold fast to what they have already heard (see 1 John 2:7) and (2) not be influenced by the teaching of the opponents.</p>
