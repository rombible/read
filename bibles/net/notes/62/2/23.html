<A NAME="23"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=14><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#943;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">angelia</font>) occurs only twice in the NT, here and in 1 John 3:11. It is a cognate of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#960;&#945;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#943;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">epangelia</font>) which occurs much more frequently (some 52 times in the NT) including 1 John 2:25. BDAG 8 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#943;&#945;</font> 1 offers the meaning &#8220;message&#8221; which suggests some overlap with the semantic range of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">logos</font>), although in the specific context of 1:5 BDAG suggests a reference to the gospel. (The precise &#8220;content&#8221; of this &#8220;good news&#8217; is given by the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> [<font face="Greektl">Joti</font>] clause which follows in 1:5b.) The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#943;&#945;</font> here is closely equivalent to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#8016;&#945;&#947;&#947;&#941;&#955;&#953;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">euangelion</font>): (1) it refers to the proclamation of the eyewitness testimony about the life and ministry of Jesus Christ as proclaimed by the author and the rest of the apostolic witnesses (prologue, esp. 1:3-4), and (2) it relates to the salvation of the hearers/readers, since the purpose of this proclamation is to bring them into fellowship with God and with the apostolic witnesses (1:3). Because of this the adjective &#8220;gospel&#8221; is included in the English translation.</p>
