<A NAME="221"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=32><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;know him.&#8221; (1) Many take the third person pronoun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">auton</font>) to refer to Jesus Christ, since he is mentioned in 2:1 and the pronoun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">autos</font>) at the beginning of 2:2 clearly refers to him. But (2) it is more likely that God is the referent here, since (a) the assurance the author is discussing here is assurance that one has come to know God (all the claims of the opponents in 1:5-2:11 concern knowing and having fellowship with the God who is light); (b) when Jesus Christ is explicitly mentioned as an example to follow in 1 John 2:6, the pronoun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954;&#949;&#8150;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ekeinos</font>) is used to distinguish this from previous references with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font>; (c) the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) which begins 2:3 is parallel to the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> which begins 1:5, suggesting that the author is now returning to the discussion of God who is light, a theme introduced in 1:5. The author will now discuss how a Christian may have assurance that he or she has come to know the God who is light.</p>
