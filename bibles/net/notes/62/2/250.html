<A NAME="250"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=61><b>tn</b> The genitive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#946;&#943;&#959;&#965;</font> (<font face="Greektl">biou</font>) is difficult to translate: (1) Many understand it as objective, so that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#946;&#943;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">bios</font>, &#8220;material life&#8221;) becomes the <i>object</i> of one&#8217;s <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#955;&#945;&#950;&#959;&#957;&#949;&#943;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">alazoneia</font>; &#8220;pride&#8221; or &#8220;boastfulness&#8221;). Various interpretations along these lines refer to boasting about one&#8217;s wealth, showing off one&#8217;s possessions, boasting of one&#8217;s social status or lifestyle. (2) It is also possible to understand the genitive as subjective, however, in which case the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#946;&#943;&#959;&#962;</font> itself <i>produces</i> the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#955;&#945;&#950;&#959;&#957;&#949;&#943;&#945;</font>. In this case, the material security of one&#8217;s life and possessions produces a boastful overconfidence. This understanding better fits the context here: The focus is on people who operate purely on a human level and have no spiritual dimension to their existence. This is the person who loves the world, whose affections are all centered on the world, who has no love for God or spiritual things (&#8220;the love of the Father is not in him,&#8221; 2:15).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>The arrogance produced by material possessions. </i>The person who thinks he has enough wealth and property to protect himself and insure his security has no need for God (or anything outside himself).</p>
