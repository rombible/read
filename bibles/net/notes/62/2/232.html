<A NAME="232"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=43><b>tn</b> The clause beginning with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joti</font>) is often taken as (1) epexegetical or (2) appositional to the commandment (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#955;&#8053;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">entolhn</font>) giving a further explanation or clarification of it. But the statement following the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> is about light and darkness, and it is difficult to see how this has anything to do with the commandment, especially as the commandment is related to the &#8220;new commandment&#8221; of John 13:34 for believers to love one another. It is far more likely that (3) the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause should be understood as causal, but this still does not answer the question of whether it offers the reason for writing the &#8220;new commandment&#8221; itself or the reason for the relative clause (&#8220;that is true in him and in you&#8221;). It probably gives the reason for the writing of the commandment, although R. E. Brown (<i>Epistles of John</i> [AB], 268) thinks it refers to both.</p>
