<A NAME="220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=31><b>tn</b> The translation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) at the beginning of 2:3 is important for understanding the argument, because a similar <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> occurs at the beginning of 1:5. The use here is not just a simple continuative or connective use, but has more of a resumptive force, pointing back to the previous use in 1:5.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Now. </i>The author, after discussing three claims of the opponents in 1:6, 8, and 10 and putting forward three counterclaims of his own in 1:7, 1:9, and 2:1, now returns to the theme of &#8220;God as light&#8221; introduced in 1:5. The author will now discuss how a Christian may have assurance that he or she has come to know the God who is light, again by contrast with the opponents who make the same profession of knowing God, but lack the reality of such knowledge, as their behavior makes clear.</p>
