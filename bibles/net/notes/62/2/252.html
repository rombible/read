The identity of these opponents has been variously debated by scholars, with some contending (1) that these false teachers originally belonged to the group of apostolic leaders, but departed from it (&#8220;went out from us,&#8221; v. 19). It is much more likely (2) that they arose from within the Christian communities to which John is writing, however, and with which he identifies himself. This identification can be seen in the interchange of the pronouns &#8220;we&#8221; and &#8220;you&#8221; between 1:10 and 2:1, for example, where &#8220;we&#8221; does not refer only to John and the other apostles, but is inclusive, referring to both himself and the Christians he is writing to (2:1, &#8220;you&#8221;).</p>
