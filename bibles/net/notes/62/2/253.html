<A NAME="253"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=64><b>tn</b> See note on the translation of the Greek verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#941;&#957;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">menw</font>) in 2:6. Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#941;&#957;&#969;</font> has been translated as &#8220;remained&#8221; since it is clear that a change of status or position is involved. The opponents departed from the author&#8217;s congregation(s) and showed by this departure that they never really belonged. Had they really belonged, they would have stayed (&#8220;remained&#8221;).</p>
