<A NAME="239"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=50><b>sn</b> <i>1 John 2:3-11. </i>The section 2:3-11 contains three claims to intimate knowledge of God, each introduced by the phrase <i>the one who says</i> (participles in the Greek text) in 2:4, 6, and 9. As with the three claims beginning with &#8220;if&#8221; in the previous section (1:6, 8, 10), these indirectly reflect the claims of the opponents. Each claim is followed by the author&#8217;s evaluation and its implications.</p>
