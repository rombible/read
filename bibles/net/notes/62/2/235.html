<A NAME="235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=46><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;his brother.&#8221; Here the term &#8220;brother&#8221; means &#8220;fellow believer&#8221; or &#8220;fellow Christian&#8221; (cf. BDAG 18 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#972;&#962;</font> 2.a). In the repeated uses of this form of address throughout the letter, it is important to remember that sometimes it refers (1) to genuine Christians (those who have remained faithful to the apostolic eyewitness testimony about who Jesus is, as outlined in the Prologue to the letter, 1:1-4; an example of this usage is 2:10; 3:14, 16), but often it refers (2) to the secessionist opponents whose views the author rejects (examples are found here at 2:9, as well as 2:11; 3:10; 3:15; 3:17; 4:20). Of course, to be technically accurate, in the latter case the reference is really to a &#8220;fellow member of the community&#8221;; the use of the term &#8220;fellow Christian&#8221; in the translation no more implies that such an individual is genuinely saved than the literal term &#8220;brother&#8221; which the author uses for such people. But a translation like &#8220;fellow member of the community&#8221; or &#8220;fellow member of the congregation&#8221; is extremely awkward and simply cannot be employed consistently throughout.</p>
