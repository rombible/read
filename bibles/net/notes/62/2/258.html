The evidence favors the nominative reading, but it is not overwhelming. At the same time, the internal evidence supports the nominative for a variety of reasons. A scribe would naturally tend to give the transitive verb a direct object, especially because of the parallel in the first half of the verse. And intrinsically, the argument seems to be in balance with v. 19: The &#8220;all&#8221; who have gone out and are not &#8220;in the know&#8221; with the &#8220;all&#8221; who have an anointing and know that they are true believers. Further, as R. E. Brown points out, &#8220;the fact of their knowledge (<i>pantes</i>), not the extent of its object (<i>panta</i>), seems best to fit the reassurance&#8221; (<i>Epistles of John</i> [AB], 349). Brown further points out the connection with the new covenant in Jer 31 with this section of 1 John, esp. Jer 31:34 &#8211; &#8220;they all [<i>pantes</i>] shall know me.&#8221; Since 1 John alludes to Jer 31, without directly quoting it, this is all the more reason to see the nominative as original: Allusions are often overlooked by scribes (transcriptional evidence), but support the intrinsic evidence. Thus, the evidence is solidly (though not overwhelmingly) behind the nominative reading.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The statement <i>you all know</i> probably constitutes an indirect allusion to the provisions of the new covenant mentioned in Jer 31 (see especially Jer 31:34). See also R. E. Brown, <i>The Epistles of John</i> [AB], 349.</p>
