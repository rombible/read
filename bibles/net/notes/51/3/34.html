The words are omitted by several English translations (NASB, NIV, ESV, TNIV). This textual problem is quite difficult to resolve. On the one hand, the parallel account in Eph 5:6 has these words, thus providing scribes a motive for adding them here. On the other hand, the reading without the words may be too hard: The <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#959;&#7991;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">en |oi&quot;</font>) of v. 7 seems to have no antecedent without <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#965;&#7985;&#959;&#973;&#962;</font> already in the text, although it could possibly be construed as neuter referring to the vice list in v. 5. Further, although the witness of B is especially important, there are other places in which B and <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46</sup> share errant readings of omission. Nevertheless, the strength of the internal evidence against the longer reading is at least sufficient to cause doubt here. The decision to retain the words in the text is less than certain. </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The expression <i>sons of disobedience </i>is a Semitic idiom that means &#8220;people characterized by disobedience.&#8221; In this context it refers to &#8220;all those who are disobedient.&#8221; Cf. Eph 5:6.</p>
