<A NAME="424"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=143><b>tn</b> The Greek sentence continues v. 9 with the phrase &#8220;with Onesimus,&#8221; but this is awkward in English, so the verb &#8220;I sent&#8221; was inserted and a new sentence started at the beginning of v. 9 in the translation. </p>
