<A NAME="415"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=134><b>tn</b> The <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jina</font>) clause has been rendered as substantival here, indicating the content of the prayer rather than the purpose for it. These two ideas are very similar and difficult to differentiate in this passage, but the conjunction <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</font> following a verb of praying is generally regarded as giving the content of the prayer.</p>
