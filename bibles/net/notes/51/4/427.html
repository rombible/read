<A NAME="427"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=146><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;those of the circumcision.&#8221; The verse as a whole is difficult to translate because it is unclear whether Paul is saying (1) that the only people working with him are Jewish converts at the time the letter is being written or previously, or (2) that Aristarchus, Mark, and Jesus Justus were the only Jewish Christians who ever worked with him. Verses 12-14 appear to indicate that Luke and Demas, who were Gentiles, were also working currently with Paul. This is the view adopted in the translation. See M. J. Harris, <i>Colossians and Philemon </i>(EGGNT), 207-8.</p>
