<A NAME="411"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=130><b>tn</b> The form of the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#949;&#973;&#949;&#964;&#949;</font> (<font face="Greektl">douleuete</font>) is ambiguous; it can be read as either indicative or imperative. In favor of the indicative: (1) it seems to explain better the first part of v. 24, esp. &#8220;from the Lord&#8221; which would then read as: &#8220;because you know that you will receive your inheritance from the Lord as a reward <i>for</i> it is the Lord you are serving.&#8221; The &#8220;for&#8221; is supplied to make the relation explicit (it is actually added in many <sc>mss &#8211; D<sup>1</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 075 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> &#8211; but the best ms evidence is against its inclusion). (2) With the imperative, one might expect <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8033;&#962; &#964;&#8183; &#954;&#965;&#961;&#943;&#8179;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jw&quot; tw kuriw</font>), as for example in Eph 6:7. In favor of the imperative: (1) an imperative resumes the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#961;&#947;&#940;&#950;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#949;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ergazesqe</font>) in v. 23a and forms a chiasm with it; (2) an imperative makes more sense of the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#940;&#961;</font> (<font face="Greektl">gar</font>) in v. 25a; (3) an imperative relates equally well to the preceding statement; (4) a parallel can be found in Rom 12:11 which uses an imperatival participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#949;&#973;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">douleuonte&quot;</font>) with the dative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8183; &#954;&#965;&#961;&#943;&#8179;</font>. For an elaboration of these points see M. J. Harris, <i>Colossians and Philemon</i> (EGGNT),<i> </i>185-86. </p>
