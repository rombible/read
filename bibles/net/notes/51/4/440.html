<A NAME="440"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=159><b>tc</b> Most witnesses, including a few important ones (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>2</sup> D <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 075 0278 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat sy), conclude this letter with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">amhn</font>, &#8220;amen&#8221;). Such a conclusion is routinely added by scribes to NT books because a few of these books originally had such an ending (cf. Rom 16:27; Gal 6:18; Jude 25). A majority of Greek witnesses have the concluding <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957; </font>in every NT book except Acts, James, and 3 John (and even in these books, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font> is found in some witnesses). It is thus a predictable variant. Further, the external evidence for the omission is quite compelling (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* A B C F G 048 6 33 81 1739* 1881 sa). The strongly preferred reading is therefore the omission of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font>.</p>
