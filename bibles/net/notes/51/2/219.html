<A NAME="219"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=72><b>tn</b> The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#964;&#8048; &#963;&#964;&#959;&#953;&#967;&#949;&#8150;&#945; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#954;&#972;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#965;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kata ta stoiceia tou kosmou</font>) is difficult to translate because of problems surrounding the precise meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#964;&#959;&#953;&#967;&#949;&#8150;&#945;</font> in this context. Originally it referred to the letters of the alphabet, with the idea at its root of &#8220;things in a row&#8221;; see C. Vaughn, &#8220;Colossians,&#8221; <i>EBC</i> 11:198. M. J. Harris (<i>Colossians and Philemon </i>[EGGNT],<i> </i>93) outlines three probable options: (1) the material elements which comprise the physical world; (2) the elementary teachings of the world (so NEB, NASB, NIV); (3) the elemental spirits of the world (so NEB, RSV). The first option is highly unlikely because Paul is not concerned here with the physical elements, e.g., carbon or nitrogen. The last two options are both possible. Though the Gnostic-like heresy at Colossae would undoubtedly have been regarded by Paul as an &#8220;elementary teaching&#8221; at best, because the idea of &#8220;spirits&#8221; played such a role in Gnostic thought, he may very well have had in mind elemental spirits that operated in the world or controlled the world (i.e., under God&#8217;s authority and permission).</p>
