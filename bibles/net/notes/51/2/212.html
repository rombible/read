<A NAME="212"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=65><b>tn</b> Though the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#949;&#955;&#940;&#946;&#949;&#964;&#949;</font> (<font face="Greektl">parelabete</font>) does not often take a double accusative, here it seems to do so. Both <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ton Criston Ihsoun</font>) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#954;&#973;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ton kurion</font>) are equally definite insofar as they both have an article, but both the word order and the use of &#8220;Christ Jesus&#8221; as a proper name suggest that it is the object (cf. Rom 10:9, 10). Thus Paul is affirming that the tradition that was delivered to the Colossians by Epaphras was Christ-centered and focused on him as Lord. </p>
