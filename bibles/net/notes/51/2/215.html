<A NAME="215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=68><b>sn</b> The three participles <i>rooted</i>, <i>built up</i>, and <i>firm</i> belong together and reflect three different metaphors. The first participle &#8220;<i>rooted</i>&#8221; (perfect tense) indicates a settled condition on the part of the Colossian believers and refers to horticulture. The second participle &#8220;<i>built up</i>&#8221; (present passive) comes from the world of architecture. The third participle &#8220;<i>firm</i> [established]&#8221; (present passive) comes from the law courts. With these three metaphors (as well as the following comment on thankfulness) Paul explains what he means when he commands them to continue to live their lives in Christ. The use of the passive probably reflects God&#8217;s activity among them. It was he who had rooted them, had been building them up, and had established them in the faith (cf. 1 Cor 3:5-15 for the use of mixed metaphors). </p>
