<A NAME="220"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=73><b>sn</b> <i>In him all the fullness of deity lives. </i>The present tense in this verse (&#8220;<i>lives</i>&#8221;) is significant. Again, as was stated in the note on 1:19, this is not a temporary dwelling, but a permanent one. Paul&#8217;s point is polemical against the idea that the fullness of God dwells anywhere else, as the Gnostics believed, except in Christ alone. At the incarnation, the second person of the Trinity assumed humanity, and is forever the God-man.</p>
