<A NAME="213"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=66><b>tn</b> The present imperative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#960;&#945;&#964;&#949;&#8150;&#964;&#949;</font> (<font face="Greektl">peripateite</font>) implies, in this context, a continuation of something already begun. This is evidenced by the fact that Paul has already referred to their faith as &#8220;orderly&#8221; and &#8220;firm&#8221; (2:5), despite the struggles of some of them with this deceptive heresy (cf. 2:16-23). The verb is used literally to refer to a person &#8220;walking&#8221; and is thus used metaphorically (i.e., ethically) to refer to the way a person lives his or her life.</p>
