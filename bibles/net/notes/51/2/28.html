<A NAME="28"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=61><b>sn</b> Paul&#8217;s point is that even though the <i>arguments</i> seem to make sense (<i>sound reasonable</i>), they are in the end false. Paul is not here arguing against the study of philosophy or serious thinking per se, but is arguing against the uncritical <i>adoption </i>of a philosophy that is at odds with a proper view of Christ and the ethics of the Christian life.</p>
