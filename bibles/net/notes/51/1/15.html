<a name="15"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=5><b>tc</b> Most witnesses, including some important ones (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A C F G I [P] 075 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> it bo), read &#8220;and the Lord Jesus Christ&#8221; at the end of this verse, no doubt to conform the wording to the typical Pauline salutation. However, excellent and early witnesses (B D K L <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 33 81 1175 1505 1739 1881 <i>al</i> sa) lack this phrase. Since the omission is inexplicable as arising from the longer reading (otherwise, these <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> would surely have deleted the phrase in the rest of the <i>corpus Paulinum</i>), it is surely authentic.</p>
