<a name="128"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=28><b>tn</b> The Greek term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#969;&#964;&#972;&#964;&#959;&#954;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">prwtotokos</font>) could refer either to first in order of time, such as a first born child, or it could refer to one who is preeminent in rank. M. J. Harris, <i>Colossians and Philemon </i>(EGGNT),<i> </i>43, expresses the meaning of the word well: &#8220;The &#8216;firstborn&#8217; was either the eldest child in a family or a person of preeminent rank. The use of this term to describe the Davidic king in Ps 88:28 LXX (=Ps 89:27 EVV), &#8216;I will also appoint him my firstborn (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#969;&#964;&#972;&#964;&#959;&#954;&#959;&#957;</font>), the most exalted of the kings of the earth,&#8217; indicates that it can denote supremacy in rank as well as priority in time. But whether the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#969;&#964;&#972;</font>- element in the word denotes time, rank, or both, the significance of the -<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#954;&#959;&#962;</font> element as indicating birth or origin (from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#943;&#954;&#964;&#969;</font>, give birth to) has been virtually lost except in ref. to lit. birth.&#8221; In Col 1:15 the emphasis is on the priority of Jesus&#8217; rank as over and above creation (cf. 1:16 and the &#8220;for&#8221; clause referring to Jesus as Creator).</p>
