<a name="135"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=35><b>tn</b> The Greek article <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#972;</font> (<font face="Greektl">to</font>), insofar as it relates to God, may be translated as a possessive pronoun, i.e., &#8220;his.&#8221; BDAG 404 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#8016;&#948;&#959;&#954;&#941;&#969;</font> 1 translates the phrase as &#8220;all the fullness willed to dwell in him&#8221; thus leaving the referent as impersonal. Insofar as Paul is alluding to the so-called emanations from God this is acceptable. But the fact that &#8220;the fullness&#8221; dwells in a person (i.e., &#8220;in him&#8221;) seems to argue for the translation &#8220;his fullness&#8221; where &#8220;his&#8221; refers to God.</p>
