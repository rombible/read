<a name="18"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=8><b>tn</b> Col 1:3-8 form one long sentence in the Greek text and have been divided at the end of v. 4 and v. 6 and within v. 6 for clarity, in keeping with the tendency in contemporary English toward shorter sentences. Thus the phrase &#8220;Your faith and love have arisen from the hope&#8221; is literally &#8220;because of the hope.&#8221; The perfect tense &#8220;have arisen&#8221; was chosen in the English to reflect the fact that the recipients of the letter had acquired this hope at conversion in the past, but that it still remains and motivates them to trust in Christ and to love one another. </p>
