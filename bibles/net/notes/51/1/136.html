<a name="136"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=36><b>tn</b> The aorist verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#953;&#954;&#8134;&#963;&#945;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">katoikhsai</font>) could be taken as an ingressive, in which case it refers to the incarnation and may be translated as &#8220;begin to dwell, to take up residence.&#8221; It is perhaps better, though, to take it as a constative aorist and simply a reference to the <i>fact </i>that the fullness of God dwells in Jesus Christ. This is a permanent dwelling, though, not a temporary one, as the present tense in 2:9 makes clear.</p>
