<a name="113"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=13><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;learned it.&#8221; The Greek text simply has &#8220;you learned&#8221; without the reference to &#8220;the gospel,&#8221; but &#8220;the gospel&#8221; is supplied to clarify the sense of the clause. Direct objects were frequently omitted in Greek when clear from the context.</p>
