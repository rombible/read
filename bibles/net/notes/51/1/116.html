Although it is possible that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969;&#956;&#8182;&#957;</font> was an early alteration of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8017;&#956;&#8182;&#957;</font> (either unintentionally, as dittography, since it comes seventeen letters after the previous <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969;&#956;&#8182;&#957;</font>; or intentionally, to conform to the surrounding first person pronouns), this supposition is difficult to maintain in light of the varied and valuable witnesses for this reading. Further, the second person is both embedded in the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#956;&#940;&#952;&#949;&#964;&#949;</font> (<font face="Greektl">emaqete</font>) and is explicit in v. 8 (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8017;&#956;&#8182;&#957;</font>). Hence, the motivation to change to the first person pronoun is counterbalanced by such evidence. The second person pronoun may have been introduced unintentionally via homoioarcton with the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8017;&#960;&#941;&#961;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Juper</font>) that immediately precedes it. As well, the second person reading is somewhat harder for it seems to address Epaphras&#8217; role only in relation to Paul and his colleagues, rather than in relation to the Colossians. Nevertheless, the decision must be based ultimately on external evidence (because the internal evidence can be variously interpreted), and this strongly supports <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969;&#956;&#8182;&#957;</font>.</p>
