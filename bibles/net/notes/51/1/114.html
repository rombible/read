<a name="114"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=14><b>tn</b> The Greek word translated &#8220;fellow slave&#8221; is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#973;&#957;&#948;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">sundoulo&quot;</font>); the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#973;&#957;</font>- prefix here denotes association. Though <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#959;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font> is normally translated &#8220;servant,&#8221; the word does not bear the connotation of a free individual serving another. BDAG notes that &#8220;&#8216;servant&#8217; for &#8216;slave&#8217; is largely confined to Biblical transl. and early American times&#8230;in normal usage at the present time the two words are carefully distinguished&#8221; (BDAG 260 s.v.). The most accurate translation is &#8220;bondservant&#8221; (sometimes found in the ASV for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#959;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font>), in that it often indicates one who sells himself into slavery to another. But as this is archaic, few today understand its force.</p>
