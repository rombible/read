But the reading was prompted by the parallel in Eph 1:7 where the wording is solid. If these words had been in the original of Colossians, why would scribes omit them here but not in Eph 1:7? Further, the testimony on behalf of the shorter reading is quite overwhelming: {<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A B C D F G <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 075 0150 6 33 1739 1881 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> latt co as well as several other versions and fathers}. The conviction that &#8220;through his blood&#8221; is not authentic in Col 1:14 is as strong as the conviction that these words are authentic in Eph 1:7. </p>
