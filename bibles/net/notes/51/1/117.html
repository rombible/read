<a name="117"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=17><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;heard about it&#8221;; <i>Grk</i> &#8220;heard.&#8221; There is no direct object stated in the Greek (direct objects were frequently omitted in Greek when clear from the context). A direct object is expected by an English reader, however, so most translations supply one. Here, however, it is not entirely clear what the author &#8220;heard&#8221;: a number of translations supply &#8220;it&#8221; (so KJV, NASB, NRSV; NAB &#8220;this&#8221;), but this could refer back either to (1) &#8220;your love in the Spirit&#8221; at the end of v. 8, or (2) &#8220;your faith in Christ Jesus and the love that you have for all the saints&#8221; (v. 4). In light of this uncertainty, other translations supply &#8220;about you&#8221; (TEV, NIV, CEV, NLT). This is preferred by the present translation since, while it does not resolve the ambiguity entirely, it does make it less easy for the English reader to limit the reference only to &#8220;your love in the Spirit&#8221; at the end of v. 8.</p>
