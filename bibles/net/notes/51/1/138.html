<a name="138"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=38><b>tc</b> The presence or absence of the second occurrence of the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#8127; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">di</font>&#8217;<font face="Greektl"> autou</font>, &#8220;through him&#8221;) is a difficult textual problem to solve. External evidence is fairly evenly divided. Many ancient and excellent witnesses lack the phrase (B D* F G I 0278 81 1175 1739 1881 2464 <i>al</i> latt sa), but equally important witnesses have it (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A C D<sup>1</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 048<sup>vid</sup> 33 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>). Both readings have strong Alexandrian support, which makes the problem difficult to decide on external evidence alone. Internal evidence points to the inclusion of the phrase as original. The word immediately preceding the phrase is the masculine pronoun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">autou</font>); thus the possibility of omission through homoioteleuton in various witnesses is likely. Scribes might have deleted the phrase because of perceived redundancy or awkwardness in the sense: The shorter reading is smoother and more elegant, so scribes would be prone to correct the text in that direction. As far as style is concerned, repetition of key words and phrases for emphasis is not foreign to the <i>corpus Paulinum</i> (see, e.g., Rom 8:23, Eph 1:13, 2 Cor 12:7). In short, it is easier to account for the shorter reading arising from the longer reading than vice versa, so the longer reading is more likely original.</p>
