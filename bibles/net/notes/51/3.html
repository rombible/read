Internally, it is possible that the second person pronoun arose through scribal conformity to the second person pronoun used previously in v. 3 (i.e., <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8017;&#956;&#8182;&#957;</font>) and following in v. 4 (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8017;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Jumeis</font>). But in terms of external criteria, the second person pronoun has superior ms support (though there is an Alexandrian split) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969;&#956;&#8182;&#957;</font> may have arisen through accident (error of sight) or scribal attempt to universalize the statement since <i>all</i> Christians have Jesus as their life.

The words are omitted by several English translations (NASB, NIV, ESV, TNIV). This textual problem is quite difficult to resolve. On the one hand, the parallel account in Eph 5:6 has these words, thus providing scribes a motive for adding them here. On the other hand, the reading without the words may be too hard: The <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#959;&#7991;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">en |oi&quot;</font>) of v. 7 seems to have no antecedent without <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#965;&#7985;&#959;&#973;&#962;</font> already in the text, although it could possibly be construed as neuter referring to the vice list in v. 5. Further, although the witness of B is especially important, there are other places in which B and <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>46</sup> share errant readings of omission. Nevertheless, the strength of the internal evidence against the longer reading is at least sufficient to cause doubt here. The decision to retain the words in the text is less than certain. </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The expression <i>sons of disobedience </i>is a Semitic idiom that means &#8220;people characterized by disobedience.&#8221; In this context it refers to &#8220;all those who are disobedient.&#8221; Cf. Eph 5:6.</p>
<A NAME="35"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=105><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;you also walked.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#960;&#945;&#964;&#941;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">peripatew</font>) is commonly used in the NT to refer to behavior or conduct of one&#8217;s life (L&amp;N 41.11).</p>
<A NAME="36"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=106><b>tn</b> The Greek article with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8048; &#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ta panta</font>) is anaphoric, referring to the previous list of vices, and has been translated here as &#8220;all <i>such </i>things.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="37"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=107><b>sn</b> <i>Put off all such things. </i>The commands in vv. 8-9 are based on two reasons given in vv. 9-10 &#8211; reasons which are expressed in terms of a metaphor about clothing oneself. Paul says that they have put off the old man and have put on the new man. Two things need to be discussed in reference to Paul&#8217;s statement. (1) What is the meaning of the clothing imagery (i.e., the &#8220;<i>have put off</i>&#8221; and &#8220;<i>have been clothed</i>&#8221;)? (2) What is the meaning of the <i>old man </i>and the <i>new man</i>? Though some commentators understand the participles &#8220;<i>have put off</i>&#8221; (v. 9) and &#8220;<i>have been clothed</i>&#8221; (v. 10) as imperatives (i.e., &#8220;put off!&#8221; and &#8220;put on!&#8221;), this use of participles is extremely rare in the NT and thus unlikely here. It is better to take them as having the semantic force of indicatives, and thus they give an explanation of what had happened to the Colossians at the time of their conversion &#8211; they had taken off the <i>old man </i>and put on the <i>new </i>when they trusted in Christ (cf. 1:4). While it is difficult to say for certain what the background to Paul&#8217;s &#8220;clothing&#8221; metaphor might be (whether it is primarily Jewish and comes from the OT, or primarily Gentile and comes from some facet of the Greco-Roman religious milieu), it is nonetheless clear, on the basis of Paul&#8217;s usage of the expression, that the <i>old man </i>refers to man as he is in Adam and dominated by sin (cf. Rom 6:6; Eph 4:22), while the <i>new man </i>refers to the Christian whose new sphere of existence is in Christ. Though the metaphor of clothing oneself primarily reflects outward actions, there is a distinct inward aspect to it, as the rest of v. 10 indicates: <i>being renewed in knowledge according to the image of the one who created it</i>. Paul&#8217;s point, then, is that Christians should take off their dirty clothing (inappropriate behavior) and put on clean clothing (behavior consistent with knowing Christ) because this has already been accomplished in a positional sense at the time of their conversion (cf. Gal 3:27 with Rom 13:14).</p>
