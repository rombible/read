<A NAME="2167"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=2100><b>tc</b> Although the majority of <sc>mss (C<sup>2</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920; &#936; </font><font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13</sup> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font><font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> </font>lat) conclude this Gospel with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">amhn</font>, &#8220;amen&#8221;), such a conclusion is routinely added by scribes to NT books because a few of these books originally had such an ending (cf. Rom 16:27; Gal 6:18; Jude 25). A majority of Greek witnesses have the concluding <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957; </font>in every NT book except Acts, James, and 3 John (and even in these books, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#956;&#8053;&#957;</font> is found in some witnesses). It is thus a predictable variant. Further, excellent and early witnesses, as well as a few others (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> </font>A B C*<sup>,3</sup> D W 1 33 <i>pc</i> it), lack the particle, rendering no doubt as to how this Gospel originally ended.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The author concludes the Gospel with a note concerning his selectivity of material. He makes it plain that he has not attempted to write an exhaustive account of the words and works of Jesus, for if one attempted to do so, &#8220;<i>the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written</i>.&#8221; This is clearly hyperbole, and as such bears some similarity to the conclusion of the Book of Ecclesiastes (12:9-12). As it turns out, the statement seems more true of the Fourth Gospel itself, which is the subject of an ever-lengthening bibliography. The statement in v. 25 serves as a final reminder that knowledge of Jesus, no matter how well-attested it may be, is still partial. Everything that Jesus did during his three and one-half years of earthly ministry is not known. This supports the major theme of the Fourth Gospel: Jesus is repeatedly identified as God, and although he may be truly known on the basis of his self-disclosure, he can never be known exhaustively. There is far more to know about Jesus than could ever be written down, or even known. On this appropriate note the Gospel of John ends.</p>
