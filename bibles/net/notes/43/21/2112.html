<A NAME="2112"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=2045><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#966;&#940;&#947;&#953;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">prosfagion</font>) is unusual. According to BDAG 886 s.v. in Hellenistic Greek it described a side dish to be eaten with bread, and in some contexts was the equivalent of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8004;&#968;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">oyon</font>), &#8220;fish.&#8221; Used in addressing a group of returning fishermen, however, it is quite clear that the speaker had fish in mind.</p>
