<A NAME="2131"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=2064><b>tn</b> Is there a significant difference in meaning between the two words for love used in the passage, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#947;&#945;&#960;&#940;&#969;</font> and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#966;&#953;&#955;&#941;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">agapaw </font>and <font face="Greektl">filew</font>)? Aside from Origen, who saw a distinction in the meaning of the two words, most of the Greek Fathers like Chrysostom and Cyril of Alexandria, saw no real difference of meaning. Neither did Augustine nor the translators of the Itala (Old Latin). This was also the view of the Reformation Greek scholars Erasmus and Grotius. The suggestion that a distinction in meaning should be seen comes primarily from a number of British scholars of the 19th century, especially Trench, Westcott, and Plummer. It has been picked up by others such as Spicq, Lenski, and Hendriksen. But most modern scholars decline to see a real difference in the meaning of the two words in this context, among them Bernard, Moffatt, Bonsirven, Bultmann, Barrett, Brown, Morris, Haenchen, and Beasley-Murray. There are three significant reasons for seeing no real difference in the meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#947;&#945;&#960;&#940;&#969;</font> and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#966;&#953;&#955;&#941;&#969;</font> in these verses: (1) the author has a habit of introducing slight stylistic variations in repeated material without any significant difference in meaning (compare, for example, 3:3 with 3:5, and 7:34 with 13:33). An examination of the uses of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#947;&#945;&#960;&#940;&#969;</font> and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#966;&#953;&#955;&#941;&#969;</font> in the Fourth Gospel seems to indicate a general interchangeability between the two. Both terms are used of God&#8217;s love for man (3:16, 16:27); of the Father&#8217;s love for the Son (3:35, 5:20); of Jesus&#8217; love for men (11:5, 11:3); of the love of men for men (13:34, 15:19); and of the love of men for Jesus (8:42, 16:27). (2) If (as seems probable) the original conversation took place in Aramaic (or possibly Hebrew), there would not have been any difference expressed because both Aramaic and Hebrew have only one basic word for love. In the LXX both <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#947;&#945;&#960;&#940;&#969;</font> and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#966;&#953;&#955;&#941;&#969;</font> are used to translate the same Hebrew word for love, although <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#947;&#945;&#960;&#940;&#969;</font> is more frequent. It is significant that in the Syriac version of the NT only one verb is used to translate vv. 15-17 (Syriac is very similar linguistically to Palestinian Aramaic). (3) Peter&#8217;s answers to the questions asked with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#947;&#945;&#960;&#940;&#969;</font> are &#8216;yes&#8217; even though he answers using the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#966;&#953;&#955;&#941;&#969;</font>. If he is being asked to love Jesus on a higher or more spiritual level his answers give no indication of this, and one would be forced to say (in order to maintain a consistent distinction between the two verbs) that Jesus finally concedes defeat and accepts only the lower form of love which is all that Peter is capable of offering. Thus it seems best to regard the interchange between <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#947;&#945;&#960;&#940;&#969;</font> and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#966;&#953;&#955;&#941;&#969;</font> in these verses as a minor stylistic variation of the author, consistent with his use of minor variations in repeated material elsewhere, and not indicative of any real difference in meaning. Thus no attempt has been made to distinguish between the two Greek words in the translation.</p>
