<A NAME="2119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=2052><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;for he was naked.&#8221; Peter&#8217;s behavior here has been puzzling to many interpreters. It is usually understood that the Greek word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#965;&#956;&#957;&#972;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">gumnos</font>, usually translated &#8220;naked&#8221;) does not refer to complete nudity (as it could), since this would have been offensive to Jewish sensibilities in this historical context. It is thus commonly understood to mean &#8220;stripped for work&#8221; here (cf. NASB, NLT), that is, with one&#8217;s outer clothing removed, and Peter was wearing either a loincloth or a loose-fitting tunic (a long shirt-like garment worn under a cloak, cf. NAB, &#8220;for he was lightly clad&#8221;). Believing himself inadequately dressed to greet the Lord, Peter threw his <i>outer garment</i> around himself and dived into the sea. C. K. Barrett (<i>St. John, </i>580-81) offered the explanation that a greeting was a religious act and thus could not be performed unless one was clothed. This still leaves the improbable picture of a person with much experience around the water putting on his outer garment before diving in. R. E. Brown&#8217;s suggestion (<i>John </i>[AB], 2:1072) seems much more probable here: The Greek verb used (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#945;&#950;&#8061;&#957;&#957;&#965;&#956;&#953;</font>, <font face="Greektl">diazwnnumi</font>) does not necessarily mean putting clothing on, but rather tying the clothing around oneself (the same verb is used in 13:4-5 of Jesus tying the towel around himself). The statement that Peter was &#8220;naked&#8221; could just as well mean that he was naked underneath the <i>outer garment</i>, and thus could not take it off before jumping into the water. But he did pause to tuck it up and tie it with the girdle before jumping in, to allow himself more freedom of movement. Thus the clause that states Peter was naked is explanatory (note the use of <i>for</i>), explaining why Peter girded up his outer garment rather than taking it off &#8211; he had nothing on underneath it and so could not remove it.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This is a parenthetical note by the author.</p>
