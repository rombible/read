<A NAME="2126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=2059><b>sn</b> Here the author makes two further points about the catch of fish: (1) there were <i>one hundred fifty-three</i> large fish in the net, and (2) even with so many, <i>the net was not torn</i>. Many symbolic interpretations have been proposed for both points (unity, especially, in the case of the second), but the reader is given no explicit clarification in the text itself. It seems better not to speculate here, but to see these details as indicative of an eyewitness account. Both are the sort of thing that would remain in the mind of a person who had witnessed them firsthand. For a summary of the symbolic interpretations proposed for the number of fish in the net, see R. E. Brown (<i>John </i>[AB], 2:1074-75), where a number are discussed at length. Perhaps the reader is simply to understand this as the abundance which results from obedience to Jesus, much as with the amount of wine generated in the water jars in Cana at the beginning of Jesus&#8217; public ministry (2:6).</p>
