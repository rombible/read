<A NAME="2129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=2062><b>tn</b> To whom (or what) does &#8220;these&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#969;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">toutwn</font>) refer? Three possibilities are suggested: (1) <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#969;&#957;</font> should be understood as neuter, &#8220;these things,&#8221; referring to the boats, nets, and fishing gear nearby. In light of Peter&#8217;s statement in 21:3, &#8220;I am going fishing,&#8221; some have understood Peter to have renounced his commission in light of his denials of Jesus. Jesus, as he restores Peter and forgives him for his denials, is asking Peter if he really loves his previous vocation more than he loves Jesus. Three things may be said in evaluation of this view: (a) it is not at all necessary to understand Peter&#8217;s statement in 21:3 as a renouncement of his discipleship, as this view of the meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#969;&#957;</font> would imply; (b) it would probably be more likely that the verb would be repeated in such a construction (see 7:31 for an example where the verb is repeated); and (c) as R. E. Brown has observed (<i>John </i>[AB], 2:1103) by Johannine standards the choice being offered to Peter between material things and the risen Jesus would seem rather ridiculous, especially after the disciples had realized whom it was they were dealing with (the Lord, see v. 12). (2) <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#969;&#957;</font> refers to the other disciples, meaning &#8220;Do you love me more than you love these other disciples?&#8221; The same objection mentioned as (c) under (1) would apply here: Could the author, in light of the realization of who Jesus is which has come to the disciples after the resurrection, and which he has just mentioned in 21:12, seriously present Peter as being offered a choice between the other disciples and the risen Jesus? This leaves option (3), that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#969;&#957;</font> refers to the other disciples, meaning &#8220;Do you love me more than these other disciples do?&#8221; It seems likely that there is some irony here: Peter had boasted in 13:37, &#8220;I will lay down my life for you,&#8221; and the synoptics present Peter as boasting even more explicitly of his loyalty to Jesus (&#8220;Even if they all fall away, I will not,&#8221; Matt 26:33; Mark 14:29). Thus the semantic force of what Jesus asks Peter here amounts to something like &#8220;Now, after you have denied me three times, as I told you you would, can you still affirm that you love me more than these other disciples do?&#8221; The addition of the auxiliary verb &#8220;do&#8221; in the translation is used to suggest to the English reader the third interpretation, which is the preferred one.</p>
