<A NAME="158"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1500><b>sn</b> The phrase <i>you are clean already</i> occurs elsewhere in the Gospel of John only at the washing of the disciples&#8217; feet in 13:10, where Jesus had used it of the disciples being cleansed from sin. This further confirms the proposed understanding of John 15:2 and 15:6 since Judas was specifically excluded from this statement (<i>but not all of you</i>).</p>
