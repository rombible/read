<A NAME="1520"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1512><b>sn</b> <i>Such branches are gathered up and thrown into the fire. </i>The author does not tell who it is who does the gathering and throwing into the fire. Although some claim that realized eschatology is so prevalent in the Fourth Gospel that no references to final eschatology appear at all, the fate of these branches seems to point to the opposite. The imagery is almost certainly that of eschatological judgment, and recalls some of the OT vine imagery which involves divine rejection and judgment of disobedient Israel (Ezek 15:4-6, 19:12).</p>
