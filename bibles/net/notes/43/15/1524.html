<A NAME="1524"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1516><b>sn</b> Once again Jesus promises the disciples<i> ask whatever you want, and it will be done for you</i>. This recalls 14:13-14, where the disciples were promised that if they asked anything in Jesus&#8217; name it would be done for them. The two thoughts are really quite similar, since here it is conditioned on the disciples&#8217; remaining in Jesus and his words remaining in them. The first phrase relates to the genuineness of their relationship with Jesus. The second phrase relates to their obedience. When both of these qualifications are met, the disciples would in fact be asking in Jesus&#8217; name and therefore according to his will.</p>
