<A NAME="1552"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=1544><b>sn</b> <i>I chose you out of the world&#8230;the world hates you. </i>Two themes are brought together here. In 8:23 Jesus had distinguished himself from the world in addressing his Jewish opponents: &#8220;You are from below, I am from above; you are of this world, I am not of this world.&#8221; In 15:16 Jesus told the disciples &#8220;You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you.&#8221; Now Jesus has united these two ideas as he informs the disciples that he has chosen them out of the world. While the disciples will still be &#8220;in&#8221; the world after Jesus has departed, they will not belong to it, and Jesus prays later in John 17:15-16 to the Father, &#8220;I do not ask you to take them out of the world, but to keep them from the evil one. They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.&#8221; The same theme also occurs in 1 John 4:5-6: &#8220;<i>They</i> are from the world; therefore <i>they</i> speak as from the world, and the world listens to <i>them</i>. <i>We</i> are from God; he who knows God listens to <i>us</i>; he who is not from God does not listen to <i>us</i>.&#8221; Thus the basic reason why the world <i>hates</i> the disciples (as it hated Jesus before them) is because they are not of the world. They are born from above, and are not of the world. For this reason the world hates them.</p>
