<A NAME="1565"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=1557><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;But now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father.&#8221; It is possible to understand both the &#8220;seeing&#8221; and the &#8220;hating&#8221; to refer to both Jesus and the Father, but this has the world &#8220;seeing&#8221; the Father, which seems alien to the Johannine Jesus. (Some point out John 14:9 as an example, but this is addressed to the disciples, not to the world.) It is more likely that the &#8220;seeing&#8221; refers to the miraculous deeds mentioned in the first half of the verse. Such an understanding of the first &#8220;both &#8211; and&#8221; construction is apparently supported by BDF §444.3.</p>
