<A NAME="1511"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1503><b>sn</b> <i>The branch cannot bear fruit by itself</i> unless it remains connected to the vine, from which its life and sustenance flows. As far as the disciples were concerned, they would produce no fruit from themselves if they did not remain in their relationship to Jesus, because the eternal life which a disciple must possess in order to bear fruit originates with Jesus; he is the source of all life and productivity for the disciple.</p>
