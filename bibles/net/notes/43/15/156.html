<A NAME="156"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1498><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;trims&#8221;; <i>Grk</i> &#8220;cleanses&#8221; (a wordplay with &#8220;clean&#8221; in v. 3). <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#922;&#945;&#952;&#945;&#943;&#961;&#949;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kaqairei</font>) is not the word one would have expected here, but it provides the transition from the vine imagery to the disciples &#8211; there is a wordplay (not reproducible in English) between <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#7988;&#961;&#949;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">airei</font>) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#952;&#945;&#943;&#961;&#949;&#953;</font> in this verse.
