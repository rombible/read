<A NAME="1513"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1505><b>tn</b> While it would be more natural to say &#8220;on the vine&#8221; (so NAB), the English preposition &#8220;in&#8221; has been retained here to emphasize the parallelism with the following clause &#8220;unless you remain in me.&#8221; To speak of remaining &#8220;in&#8221; a person is not natural English either, but is nevertheless a biblical concept (cf. &#8220;in Christ&#8221; in Eph 1:3, 4, 6, 7, 11).</p>
