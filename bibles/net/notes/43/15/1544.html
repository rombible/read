<A NAME="1544"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1536><b>sn</b> The purpose for which the disciples were appointed (&#8220;commissioned&#8221;) is <i>to go and bear fruit, fruit that remains</i>. The introduction of the idea of &#8220;going&#8221; at this point suggests that the fruit is something more than just character qualities in the disciples&#8217; own lives, but rather involves fruit in the lives of others, i.e., Christian converts. There is a mission involved (cf. John 4:36). The idea that their fruit is permanent, however, relates back to vv. 7-8, as does the reference to asking the Father in Jesus&#8217; name. It appears that as the imagery of the vine and the branches develops, the &#8220;fruit&#8221; which the branches produce shifts in emphasis from qualities in the disciples&#8217; own lives in John 15:2, 4, 5 to the idea of a mission which affects the lives of others in John 15:16. The point of transition would be the reference to fruit in 15:8.</p>
