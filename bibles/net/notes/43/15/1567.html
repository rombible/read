<A NAME="1567"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">67</span><note=1559><b>sn</b> A quotation from Ps 35:19 and Ps 69:4. As a technical term <i>law </i>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#957;&#972;&#956;&#959;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">nomos</font>) is usually restricted to the Pentateuch (the first five books of the OT), but here it must have a broader reference, since the quotation is from Ps 35:19 or Ps 69:4. The latter is the more likely source for the quoted words, since it is cited elsewhere in John&#8217;s Gospel (2:17 and 19:29, in both instances in contexts associated with Jesus&#8217; suffering and death).</p>
