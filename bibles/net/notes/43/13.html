<A NAME="132"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1326><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;that he should depart.&#8221; The <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jina</font>) clause in Koine Greek frequently encroached on the simple infinitive (for the sake of greater clarity).</p>
<A NAME="133"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1327><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;he now loved them completely,&#8221; or &#8220;he now loved them to the uttermost&#8221; (see John 19:30). All of John 13:1 is a single sentence in Greek, although in English this would be unacceptably awkward. At the end of the verse the idiom <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#962; &#964;&#941;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">eis telos</font>) was translated literally as &#8220;to the end&#8221; and the modern equivalents given in the note above, because there is an important lexical link between this passage and John 19:30, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#949;&#964;&#941;&#955;&#949;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">tetelestai</font>, &#8220;It is ended&#8221;). </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The full extent of Jesus&#8217; love for his disciples is not merely seen in his humble service to them in washing their feet (the most common interpretation of the passage). The full extent of his love for them is demonstrated in his sacrificial death for them on the cross. The footwashing episode which follows then becomes a prophetic act, or acting out beforehand, of his upcoming death on their behalf. The message for the disciples was that they were to love one another not just in humble, self-effacing service, but were to be willing to die for one another. At least one of them got this message eventually, though none understood it at the time (see 1 John 3:16).</p>
<A NAME="134"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1328><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Supper.&#8221; To avoid possible confusion because of different regional English usage regarding the distinction between &#8220;dinner&#8221; and &#8220;supper&#8221; as an evening meal, the translation simply refers to &#8220;the evening meal.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="135"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1329><b>sn</b> At this point <i>the devil had already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon&#8217;s son, that he should betray Jesus</i>. C. K. Barrett (<i>St. John</i>, 365) thought this was a reference to the idea entering the devil&#8217;s own heart, but this does not seem likely. It is more probable that Judas&#8217; heart is meant, since the use of the Greek article (rather than a possessive pronoun) is a typical idiom when a part of one&#8217;s own body is indicated. Judas&#8217; name is withheld until the end of the sentence for dramatic effect (emphasis). This action must be read in light of 13:27, and appears to refer to a preliminary idea or plan.</p>

<A NAME="1311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1335><b>tn</b> The plural <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8048; &#7985;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#953;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ta Jimatia</font>) is probably a reference to more than one garment (cf. John 19:23-24). If so, this would indicate that Jesus stripped to a loincloth, like a slave. The translation &#8220;outer clothes&#8221; is used to indicate that Jesus was not completely naked, since complete nudity would have been extremely offensive to Jewish sensibilities in this historical context.</p>
<A NAME="1312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1336><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;taking a towel he girded himself.&#8221; Jesus would have wrapped the towel (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#941;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#959;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">lention</font>) around his waist (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#941;&#950;&#969;&#963;&#949;&#957; &#7953;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#972;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">diezwsen Jeauton</font>) for use in wiping the disciples&#8217; feet. The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#941;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#959;&#957;</font> is a Latin loanword (<i>linteum</i>) which is also found in the rabbinic literature (see BDAG 592 s.v.). It would have been a long piece of linen cloth, long enough for Jesus to have wrapped it about his waist and still used the free end to wipe the disciples&#8217; feet.</p>

<A NAME="1326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1350><b>sn</b> <i>The one who has bathed needs only to wash his feet. </i>A common understanding is that the &#8220;bath&#8221; Jesus referred to is the initial cleansing from sin, which necessitates only &#8220;lesser, partial&#8221; cleansings from sins after conversion. This makes a fine illustration from a homiletic standpoint, but is it the meaning of the passage? This seems highly doubtful. Jesus stated that the disciples were <i>completely clean</i> except for Judas (vv. 10b, 11). What they needed was to have their feet washed by Jesus. In the broader context of the Fourth Gospel, the significance of the foot-washing seems to point not just to an example of humble service (as most understand it), but something more &#8211; Jesus&#8217; self-sacrificial death on the cross. If this is correct, then the foot-washing which they needed to undergo represented their <i>acceptance</i> of this act of self-sacrifice on the part of their master. This makes Peter&#8217;s initial abhorrence of the act of humiliation by his master all the more significant in context; it also explains Jesus&#8217; seemingly harsh reply to Peter (above, v. 8; compare Matt 16:21-23 where Jesus says to Peter, &#8220;Get behind me, Satan&#8221;).</p>

In the previous verse he told them they were to <i>wash one another&#8217;s feet</i>. What is the point of the example? If it is simply an act of humble service, as most interpret the significance, then Jesus is really telling his disciples to serve one another in humility rather than seeking preeminence over one another. If, however, the example is one of self-sacrifice up to the point of death, then Jesus is telling them to lay down their lives for one another (cf. 15:13).</p>

<A NAME="1355"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=1379><b>sn</b> Here for the first time <i>the one Jesus loved</i>, the &#8216;beloved disciple,&#8217; is introduced. This individual also is mentioned in 19:26, 20:2, 21:7, and 21:20. Some have suggested that this disciple is to be identified with Lazarus, since the Fourth Gospel specifically states that Jesus loved him (11:3, 5, 36). From the terminology alone this is a possibility; the author is certainly capable of using language in this way to indicate connections. But there is nothing else to indicate that Lazarus was present at the last supper; Mark 14:17 seems to indicate it was only the twelve who were with Jesus at this time, and there is no indication in the Fourth Gospel to the contrary. Nor does it appear that Lazarus ever stood so close to Jesus as the later references in chaps. 19, 20 and 21 seem to indicate. When this is coupled with the omission of all references to John son of Zebedee from the Fourth Gospel, it seems far more likely that the references to the beloved disciple should be understood as references to him.</p>
<A NAME="1356"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=1380><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;was reclining.&#8221; This reflects the normal 1st century practice of eating a meal in a semi-reclining position. </p>
<A NAME="1357"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=1381><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;was reclining in the bosom (or &#8220;lap&#8221;) of Jesus&#8221; (according to both L&amp;N 17.25 and BDAG 65 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#940;&#954;&#949;&#953;&#956;&#945;&#953;</font> 2 an idiom for taking the place of honor at a meal, but note the similar expression in John 1:18). Whether this position or the position to the left of Jesus should be regarded as the position of second highest honor (next to the host, in this case Jesus, who was in the position of highest honor) is debated. F. Prat, &#8220;Les places d&#8217;honneur chez les Juifs contemporains du Christ&#8221; (<i>RSR</i> 15 [1925]: 512-22), who argued that the table arrangement was that of the Roman <i>triclinium</i> (a U-shaped table with Jesus and two other disciples at the bottom of the U), considered the position to the left of Jesus to be the one of second highest honor. Thus the present translation renders this &#8220;a position of honor&#8221; without specifying which one (since both of the two disciples to the right and to the left of Jesus would be in positions of honor). Other translations differ as to how they handle the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#8183; &#954;&#972;&#955;&#960;&#8179; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">en tw kolpw tou Ihsou</font>; &#8220;leaning on Jesus&#8217; bosom,&#8221; KJV; &#8220;lying close to the breast of Jesus,&#8221; RSV; &#8220;reclining on Jesus&#8217; breast,&#8221; NASB; &#8220;reclining next to him,&#8221; NIV, NRSV) but the symbolic significance of the beloved disciple&#8217;s position seems clear. He is close to Jesus and in an honored position. The phrase as an idiom for a place of honor at a feast is attested in the <i>Epistles</i> of Pliny (the Younger) 4.22.4, an approximate contemporary of Paul.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Note that the same expression translated <i>in a place of honor</i> here (<i>Grk </i>&#8220;in the bosom of&#8221;) is used to indicate Jesus&#8217; relationship with the Father in 1:18.</p>
<A NAME="1358"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=1382><b>sn</b> It is not clear where <i>Simon Peter</i> was seated. If he were on Jesus&#8217; other side, it is difficult to see why he would not have asked the question himself. It would also have been difficult to beckon to the beloved disciple, on Jesus&#8217; right, from such a position. So apparently Peter was seated somewhere else. It is entirely possible that Judas was seated to Jesus&#8217; left. Matt 26:25 seems to indicate that Jesus could speak to him without being overheard by the rest of the group. Judas is evidently in a position where Jesus can hand him the morsel of food (13:26).</p>

Luke 22:3 uses the same terminology of Satan &#8220;entering into&#8221; Judas but indicates it happened before the last supper at the time Judas made his deal with the authorities. This is not necessarily irreconcilable with John&#8217;s account, however, because John 13:2 makes it clear that Judas had already come under satanic influence prior to the meal itself. The statement here is probably meant to indicate that Judas at this point came under the influence of Satan even more completely and finally. It marks the end of a process which, as Luke indicates, had begun earlier.</p>

The comment is more than just a time indicator, however. With the departure of Judas to set in motion the betrayal, arrest, trials, crucifixion, and death of Jesus, daytime is over and <i>night</i> has come (see John 9:5; 11:9-10; 12:35-36). Judas had become one of those who walked by night and stumbled, because the light was not in him (11:10).</p>

Although the <sc>mss that omit the words are significantly better witnesses, the omission may have occurred because of an error of sight due to homoioteleuton (v. 31 ends in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183;</font> [<font face="Greektl">en autw</font>, &#8220;in him&#8221;], as does this clause). Further, the typical step-parallelism found in John is retained if the clause is kept intact (<i>TCGNT</i> 205-6). At the same time, it is difficult to explain how such a wide variety of witnesses would have accidentally deleted this clause, and arguments for intentional deletion are not particularly convincing. NA<sup>27</sup> rightly places the words in brackets, indicating doubt as to their authenticity.</p>

(For further information see R. G. Bratcher, &#8220;&#8216;The Jews&#8217; in the Gospel of John,&#8221; <i>BT </i>26 [1975]: 401-9.) Here the phrase refers to the residents of Jerusalem in general, or to the Jewish religious leaders in particular, who had sent servants to attempt to arrest Jesus on that occasion (John 7:33-35).

<A NAME="1387"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">87</span><note=1411><b>sn</b> The idea that love is a <i>commandment</i> is interesting. In the OT the ten commandments have a setting in the covenant between God and Israel at Sinai; they were the stipulations that Israel had to observe if the nation were to be God&#8217;s chosen people. In speaking of love as the <i>new commandment</i> for those whom Jesus had chosen as his own (John 13:1, 15:16) and as a mark by which they could be distinguished from others (13:35), John shows that he is thinking of this scene in covenant terminology. But note that the disciples are to love &#8220;<i>Just as I have loved you</i>&#8221; (13:34). The love Jesus has for his followers cannot be duplicated by them in one sense, because it effects their salvation, since he lays down his life for them: It is an act of love that gives life to people. But in another sense, they can follow his example (recall <i>to the end, </i>13:1; also 1 John 3:16, 4:16 and the interpretation of Jesus&#8217; washing of the disciples&#8217; feet). In this way Jesus&#8217; disciples are to love one another: They are to follow his example of sacrificial service to one another, to death if necessary.</p>
