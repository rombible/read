<A NAME="91"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=874><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;going along.&#8221; The opening words of chap. 9, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#960;&#945;&#961;&#940;&#947;&#969;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai paragwn</font>), convey only the vaguest indication of the circumstances. </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Since there is no break with chap. 8, Jesus is presumably still in Jerusalem, and presumably <i>not</i> still in the temple area. The events of chap. 9 fall somewhere between the feast of Tabernacles (John 7:2) and the feast of the Dedication (John 10:22). But in the author&#8217;s narrative the connection exists &#8211; the incident recorded in chap. 9 (along with the ensuing debates with the Pharisees) serves as a real-life illustration of the claim Jesus made in 8:12, <i>I am the light of the world.</i> This is in fact the probable theological motivation behind the juxtaposition of these two incidents in the narrative. The second serves as an illustration of the first, and as a concrete example of the victory of light over darkness. One other thing which should be pointed out about the miracle recorded in chap. 9 is its messianic significance. In the OT it is God himself who is associated with the giving of sight to the blind (Exod 4:11, Ps 146:8). In a number of passages in Isa (29:18, 35:5, 42:7) it is considered to be a messianic activity.</p>

This was a common belief in Judaism; the rabbis used Ezek 18:20 to prove there was no death without sin, and Ps 89:33 to prove there was no punishment without guilt (the Babylonian Talmud, <i>b. Shabbat </i>55a, although later than the NT, illustrates this). Thus in this case the sin must have been on the part of the man&#8217;s parents, or during his own prenatal existence. <i>Song Rabbah</i> 1:41 (another later rabbinic work) stated that when a pregnant woman worshiped in a heathen temple the unborn child also committed idolatry. This is only one example of how, in rabbinic Jewish thought, an unborn child was capable of sinning.</p>

<A NAME="913"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=886><b>sn</b> Jesus&#8217; statement <i>I am the light of the world</i> connects the present account with 8:12. Here (seen more clearly than at 8:12) it is obvious what the author sees as the significance of Jesus&#8217; statement. &#8220;Light&#8221; is not a metaphysical definition of the person of Jesus but a description of his effect on the world, forcing everyone in the world to &#8216;choose up sides&#8217; for or against him (cf. 3:19-21).</p>
<A NAME="914"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=887><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;said these things.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="915"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=888><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;clay&#8221; (moistened earth of a clay-like consistency). The textual variant preserved in the Syriac text of Ephraem&#8217;s commentary on the <i>Diatessaron</i> (&#8220;he made eyes from his clay&#8221;) probably arose from the interpretation given by Irenaeus in <i>Against Heresies</i>: &#8220;that which the Artificer, the Word, had omitted to form in the womb, he then supplied in public.&#8221; This involves taking the clay as an allusion to Gen 2:7, which is very unlikely.</p>
<A NAME="916"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=889><b>tn</b> Because of the length and complexity of the Greek sentence, the conjunction <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) was replaced by a third person pronoun and a new sentence started here in the translation.</p>
<A NAME="917"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=890><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;on his.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="918"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=891><b>tn</b> The pool&#8217;s name in Hebrew is <i>shiloah</i> from the Hebrew verb &#8220;to send.&#8221; In Gen 49:10 the somewhat obscure <i>shiloh</i> was interpreted messianically by later Jewish tradition, and some have seen a lexical connection between the two names (although this is somewhat dubious). It is known, however, that it was from the pool of Siloam that the water which was poured out at the altar during the feast of Tabernacles was drawn.</p>
<A NAME="919"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=892><b>sn</b> This is a parenthetical note by the author.<i> </i>Why does he comment on the meaning of the name of the pool? Here, the significance is that the Father <i>sent</i> the Son, and the Son <i>sent</i> the man born blind. The name of the pool is applicable to the man, but also to Jesus himself, who was sent from heaven.</p>
<A NAME="920"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=893><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;So he&#8221;; the referent (the blind man) is specified in the translation for clarity.</p>

But through him, Jesus is being judged. Yet in reality (as the discerning reader will realize) it is ironically the Pharisees themselves who are being judged by their response to Jesus who is the light of the world (cf. 3:17-21).</p>

<A NAME="948"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=921><b>tn</b> As a response to the answers of the man who used to be blind, the use of the imperfect tense in the reply of the Pharisees is best translated as an ingressive imperfect (&#8220;began to say&#8221; or &#8220;started saying&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="949"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=922><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;he does not keep.&#8221;</p>

But here, since <i>prophet </i>is anarthrous (is not accompanied by the Greek article) and since in his initial reply in 9:11-12 the man showed no particular insight into the true identity of Jesus, this probably does not refer to <i>the</i> prophet of Deut 18:15, but merely to an unusual person who is capable of working miracles. The Pharisees had put this man on the spot, and he felt compelled to say something about Jesus, but he still didn&#8217;t have a clear conception of who Jesus was, so he labeled him a &#8220;prophet.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="956"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=929><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the Jewish religious authorities&#8221;; <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the Jews.&#8221; In NT usage the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#959;&#965;&#948;&#945;&#8150;&#959;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Ioudaioi</font>) may refer to the entire Jewish people, the residents of Jerusalem and surrounding territory, the authorities in Jerusalem, or merely those who were hostile to Jesus. (For further information see R. G. Bratcher, &#8220;&#8216;The Jews&#8217; in the Gospel of John,&#8221; <i>BT </i>26 [1975]: 401-9.) Here the phrase refers mainly to the Pharisees, mentioned by name in John 9:13, 15, 16. References in this context to Pharisees and to the synagogue (v. 22) suggest an emphasis on the religious nature of the debate which is brought out by the translation &#8220;the Jewish religious leaders.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="957"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=930><b>tn</b> The Greek text contains the words &#8220;about him&#8221; at this point: &#8220;the Jewish authorities did not believe about him&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="969"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">69</span><note=942><b>sn</b> This reference to excommunication from the Jewish synagogue for those who had made some sort of confession about Jesus being the Messiah is dismissed as anachronistic by some (e.g., Barrett) and nonhistorical by others. In later Jewish practice there were at least two forms of excommunication: a temporary ban for thirty days, and a permanent ban. But whether these applied in NT times is far from certain. There is no substantial evidence for a formal ban on Christians until later than this Gospel could possibly have been written. This may be a reference to some form of excommunication adopted as a contingency to deal with those who were proclaiming Jesus to be the Messiah. If so, there is no other record of the procedure than here. It was probably local, limited to the area around Jerusalem. See also the note on <i>synagogue</i> in 6:59.</p>

<A NAME="9108"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">108</span><note=981><b>sn</b> Assuming the authenticity of John 9:38-39a (see the <b>tc</b> note following the bracket in v. 39), the man&#8217;s response after Jesus&#8217; statement of v. 37 is extremely significant: He <i>worshiped </i>Jesus. In the Johannine context the word would connote its full sense: This was something due God alone. Note also that Jesus did not prevent the man from doing this. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#954;&#965;&#957;&#941;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">proskunew</font>) is used in John 4:20-25 of worshiping God, and again with the same sense in 12:20. This would be the only place in John&#8217;s Gospel where anyone is said to have worshiped Jesus using this term. As such, it forms the climax of the story of the man born blind, but the uniqueness of the concept of worshiping Jesus at this point in John's narrative (which reaches its ultimate climax in the confession of Thomas in John 20:28) may suggest it is too early for such a response and it represents a later scribal addition.</p>
<A NAME="9109"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">109</span><note=982><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And Jesus.&#8221; Because of the difference between Greek style, which often begins sentences or clauses with &#8220;and,&#8221; and English style, which generally does not, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has not been translated here.</p>
<A NAME="9110"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">110</span><note=983><b>tc</b> &#8225; Some early and important witnesses (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>75</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* W b sa<sup>ms</sup> ac<sup>2</sup> mf) lack the words, &#8220;He said, &#8216;Lord, I believe,&#8217; and he worshiped him. Jesus said,&#8221; (vv. 38-39a). This is weighty evidence for the omission of these words. It is difficult to overstate the value of <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>75</sup> here, since it is the only currently available papyrus ms extant for the text of John 9:38-39. Further, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> is an important and early Alexandrian witness for the omission. The versional testimony and codex W also give strong support to the omission. Nearly all other <sc>mss, however, include these words. The omission may have been occasioned by parablepsis (both vv. 37 and 39 begin with &#8220;Jesus said to him&#8221;), though it is difficult to account for such an error across such a wide variety of witnesses. On the other hand, the longer reading appears to be motivated by liturgical concerns (so R. E. Brown, <i>John </i>[AB], 1:375), since the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#954;&#965;&#957;&#941;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">proskunew</font>, &#8220;I worship&#8221;) is used in John 4:20-25 of worshiping God, and again with the same sense in 12:20. If these words were authentic here, this would be the only place in John&#8217;s Gospel where Jesus is the explicit object of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#954;&#965;&#957;&#941;&#969;</font>. Even if these words are not authentic, such an omission would nevertheless hardly diminish John&#8217;s high Christology (cf. 1:1; 5:18-23; 14:6-10; 20:28), nor the implicit worship of him by Thomas (20:28). Nevertheless, a decision is difficult, and the included words may reflect a very early tradition about the blind man&#8217;s response to Jesus.</p>

But the Pharisees, who claimed to possess spiritual sight, were spiritually blinded. The reader might recall Jesus&#8217; words to Nicodemus in 3:10, &#8220;Are you the teacher of Israel and don&#8217;t understand these things?&#8221; In other words, to receive Jesus was to receive the light of the world, to reject him was to reject the light, close one&#8217;s eyes, and become blind. This is the serious sin of which Jesus had warned before (8:21-24). The blindness of such people was incurable since they had rejected the only cure that exists (cf. 12:39-41).</p>
