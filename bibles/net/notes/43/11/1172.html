<A NAME="1172"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">72</span><note=1167><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;this one&#8221;; the second half of 11:37 reads <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Could not this one who opened the eyes of the blind have done something to keep this one from dying?&#8221; In the Greek text the repetition of &#8220;this one&#8221; in 11:37b referring to two different persons (first Jesus, second Lazarus) could confuse a modern reader. Thus the first reference, to Jesus, has been translated as &#8220;he&#8221; to refer back to the beginning of v. 37, where the reference to &#8220;the man who caused the blind man to see&#8221; is clearly a reference to Jesus. The second reference, to Lazarus, has been specified (&#8220;Lazarus&#8221;) in the translation for clarity.</p>
