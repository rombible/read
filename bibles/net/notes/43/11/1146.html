<A NAME="1146"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1141><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Your brother will rise again.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b><i> </i>Jesus&#8217; remark to Martha that Lazarus would <i>come back to life again</i> is another example of the misunderstood statement. Martha apparently took it as a customary statement of consolation and joined Jesus in professing belief in the general resurrection of the body at the end of the age. However, as Jesus went on to point out in 11:25-26, Martha&#8217;s general understanding of the resurrection at the last day was inadequate for the present situation, for the gift of life that conquers death was a present reality to Jesus. This is consistent with the author&#8217;s perspective on eternal life in the Fourth Gospel: It is not only a future reality, but something to be experienced in the present as well. It is also consistent with the so-called &#8220;realized eschatology&#8221; of the Fourth Gospel.</p>
