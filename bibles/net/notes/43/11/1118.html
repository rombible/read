<A NAME="1118"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1113><b>sn</b> What is the <i>light of this world</i>? On one level, of course, it refers to the sun, but the reader of John&#8217;s Gospel would recall 8:12 and understand Jesus&#8217; symbolic reference to himself as the light of the world. There is only a limited time left (<i>Are there not twelve hours in a day?</i>) until the Light will be withdrawn (until Jesus returns to the Father) and the one who walks around in the dark will trip and fall (compare the departure of Judas by night in 13:30).</p>
