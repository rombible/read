<A NAME="1188"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">88</span><note=1183><b>sn</b> Many have wondered how Lazarus got out of the tomb if <i>his hands and feet</i> were still <i>tied up with strips of cloth</i>. The author does not tell, and with a miracle of this magnitude, this is not an important fact to know. If Lazarus&#8217; decomposing body was brought back to life by the power of God, then it could certainly have been moved out of the tomb by that same power. Others have suggested that the legs were bound separately, which would remove the difficulty, but the account gives no indication of this. What may be of more significance for the author is the comparison which this picture naturally evokes with the resurrection of Jesus, where the graveclothes stayed in the tomb neatly folded (20:6-7). Jesus, unlike Lazarus, would never need graveclothes again.</p>
