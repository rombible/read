<A NAME="1152"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=1147><b>tn</b> The perfect tense in Greek is often used to emphasize the results or present state of a past action. Such is the case here. To emphasize this nuance the perfect tense verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#949;&#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#965;&#954;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pepisteuka</font>) has been translated as a present tense. This is in keeping with the present context, where Jesus asks of her present state of belief in v. 26, and the theology of the Gospel as a whole, which emphasizes the continuing effects and present reality of faith. For discussion on this use of the perfect tense, see <i>ExSyn</i> 574-76 and B. M. Fanning, <i>Verbal Aspect</i>, 291-97.</p>
