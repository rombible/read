<A NAME="11106"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">106</span><note=1201><b>sn</b> The author in his comment expands the prophecy to include the Gentiles (<i>not for the Jewish nation only</i>), a confirmation that the Fourth Gospel was directed, at least partly, to a Gentile audience. There are echoes of Pauline concepts here (particularly Eph 2:11-22) in the stress on the unity of Jew and Gentile.</p>
