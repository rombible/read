<A NAME="1196"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">96</span><note=1191><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Sanhedrin&#8221; (the Sanhedrin was the highest legal, legislative, and judicial body among the Jews). The <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#965;&#957;&#941;&#948;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">sunedrion</font>) which they gathered was probably an informal meeting rather than the official Sanhedrin. This is the only occurrence of the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#965;&#957;&#941;&#948;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;</font> in the Gospel of John, and the only anarthrous singular use in the NT. There are other plural anarthrous uses which have the general meaning &#8220;councils.&#8221; The fact that Caiaphas in 11:49 is referred to as &#8220;one of them&#8221; supports the unofficial nature of the meeting; in the official Sanhedrin he, being high priest that year, would have presided over the assembly. Thus it appears that an informal council was called to discuss what to do about Jesus and his activities.</p>
