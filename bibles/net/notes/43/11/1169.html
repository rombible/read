<A NAME="1169"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">69</span><note=1164><b>sn</b> <i>Jesus wept. </i>The Greek word used here for Jesus&#8217; weeping (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#948;&#940;&#954;&#961;&#965;&#963;&#949;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">edakrusen</font>)<i> </i>is different from the one used to describe the weeping of Mary and the Jews in v. 33 which indicated loud wailing and cries of lament. This word simply means &#8220;to shed tears&#8221; and has more the idea of quiet grief. But why did Jesus do this? Not out of grief for Lazarus, since he was about to be raised to life again. L. Morris (<i>John </i>[NICNT]<i>, </i>558) thinks it was grief over the misconception of those round about. But it seems that in the context the weeping is triggered by the thought of Lazarus in the tomb: This was not personal grief over the loss of a friend (since Lazarus was about to be restored to life) but grief over the effects of sin, death, and the realm of Satan. It was a natural complement to the previous emotional expression of anger (11:33). It is also possible that Jesus wept at the tomb of Lazarus because he knew there was also a tomb for himself ahead.</p>
