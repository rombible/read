<A NAME="1128"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1123><b>sn</b> <i>So that you may believe. </i>Why does Jesus make this statement? It seems necessary to understand the disciples&#8217; belief here in a developmental sense, because there are numerous references to the disciples&#8217; faith previous to this in John&#8217;s Gospel, notably 2:11. Their concept of who Jesus really was is continually being expanded and challenged; they are undergoing spiritual growth; the climax is reached in the confession of Thomas in John 20:28.</p>
