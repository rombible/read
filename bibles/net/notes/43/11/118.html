<A NAME="118"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1103><b>sn</b> <i>So that the Son of God may be glorified through it. </i>These statements are highly ironic: For Lazarus, the sickness did not end in his death, because he was restored to life. But for Jesus himself, the miraculous sign he performed led to his own death, because it confirmed the authorities in their plan to kill Jesus (11:47-53). In the Gospel of John, Jesus&#8217; death is consistently portrayed as his &#8216;glorification&#8217; through which he accomplishes his return to the Father.</p>
