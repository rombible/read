<A NAME="1144"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1139><b>sn</b> The statement &#8220;<i>whatever you ask from God, God will grant you</i>&#8221; by Martha presents something of a dilemma, because she seems to be suggesting here (implicitly at least) the possibility of a resurrection for her brother. However, Martha&#8217;s statement in 11:39 makes it clear that she had no idea that a resurrection was still possible. How then are her words in 11:22 to be understood? It seems best to take them as a confession of Martha&#8217;s continuing faith in Jesus even though he was not there in time to help her brother. She means, in effect, &#8220;Even though you weren&#8217;t here in time to help, I still believe that God grants your requests.&#8221;</p>
