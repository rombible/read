<A NAME="1141"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1136><b>sn</b> Notice the difference in the response of the two sisters: Martha <i>went out to meet</i> Jesus, while Mary remains <i>sitting in the house</i>. It is similar to the incident in Luke 10:38-42. Here again one finds Martha occupied with the responsibilities of hospitality; she is the one who greets Jesus.</p>
