<A NAME="181"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1728><b>sn</b> <i>When he had said these things</i> appears to be a natural transition at the end of the Farewell Discourse (the farewell speech of Jesus to his disciples in John 13:31-17:26, including the final prayer in 17:1-26). The author states that Jesus <i>went out with his disciples</i>, a probable reference to their leaving the upper room where the meal and discourse described in chaps. 13-17 took place (although some have seen this only as a reference to their leaving the city, with the understanding that some of the Farewell Discourse, including the concluding prayer, was given <i>en route</i>, cf. 14:31). They crossed the Kidron Valley and came to a garden, or olive orchard, identified in Matt 26:36 and Mark 14:32 as Gethsemane. The name is not given in Luke&#8217;s or John&#8217;s Gospel, but the garden must have been located somewhere on the lower slopes of the Mount of Olives.</p>

<A NAME="186"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1733><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;a cohort.&#8221; The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#960;&#949;&#8150;&#961;&#945;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">speiran</font>) is a technical term for a Roman cohort, normally a force of 600 men (one tenth of a legion). It was under the command of a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#967;&#953;&#955;&#943;&#945;&#961;&#967;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ciliarco&quot;</font>, v. 12). Because of the improbability of an entire cohort being sent to arrest a single man, some have suggested that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#960;&#949;&#8150;&#961;&#945;&#957;</font> here refers only to a maniple, a force of 200. But the use of the word here does not necessarily mean the entire cohort was present on this mission, but only that it was the cohort which performed the task (for example, saying the fire department put out the fire does not mean that every fireman belonging to the department was on the scene at the time). These Roman soldiers must have been ordered to accompany the servants of the chief priests and Pharisees by Pilate, since they would have been under the direct command of the Roman prefect or procurator. It is not difficult to understand why Pilate would have been willing to assist the Jewish authorities in such a way. With a huge crowd of pilgrims in Jerusalem for the Passover, the Romans would have been especially nervous about an uprising of some sort. No doubt the chief priests and Pharisees had informed Pilate that this man Jesus was claiming to be the Messiah, or in the terms Pilate would understand, king of Israel.</p>
<A NAME="187"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1734><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;officers of the chief priests and Pharisees&#8221; is a comprehensive name for the groups represented in the ruling council (the Sanhedrin) as in John 7:32, 45; 18:3, 12, 18, 22; 19:6. They are different from the Levites who served as &#8220;temple police&#8221; according to K. H. Rengstorf (<i>TDNT</i> 8:540). In John 7:32ff. these officers had made an unsuccessful attempt to arrest Jesus, and perhaps this is part of the reason why their leaders had made sure they were accompanied by Roman soldiers this time. No more mistakes were to be tolerated.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> See the note on <i>Pharisees</i> in 1:24.</p>
<A NAME="188"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1735><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;to the orchard&#8221; are not in the Greek text but are repeated from v. 1 for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="189"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1736><b>tn</b> These were lamps that had some sort of covering to protect them from wind and rain. In earlier usage the word meant &#8220;torch&#8221; but by NT times it apparently meant a lamp designed to be used outdoors, so &#8220;lantern&#8221; is a good contemporary English equivalent.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Mention of the <i>lanterns and torches</i> suggests a detail remembered by one who was an eyewitness, but in connection with the light/darkness motif of John&#8217;s Gospel, it is a vivid reminder that it is night; the darkness has come at last (cf. 13:30).</p>
<A NAME="1810"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1737><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;knowing all things that were coming upon him.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1811"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1738><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Whom do you seek?&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1812"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1739><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;They answered.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The author does not state precisely who from the group of soldiers and temple police <i>replied</i> to Jesus at this point. It may have been the commander of the Roman soldiers, although his presence is not explicitly mentioned until 18:12. It may also have been one of the officers of the chief priests. To the answer given, &#8220;Jesus the Nazarene,&#8221; Jesus replies &#8220;I am [he].&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1813"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1740><b>sn</b> This is a parenthetical note by the author. Before he states the response to Jesus&#8217; identification of himself, the author inserts a parenthetical note that Judas, again identified as <i>the one who betrayed him</i> (cf. 18:2), was standing with the group of soldiers and officers of the chief priests. Many commentators have considered this to be an awkward insertion, but in fact it heightens considerably the dramatic effect of the response to Jesus&#8217; self-identification in the following verse, and has the added effect of informing the reader that along with the others the betrayer himself ironically falls down at Jesus&#8217; feet (18:6).</p>
<A NAME="1814"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1741><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Jesus) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1815"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1742><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;moved back&#8221; (but here a fairly rapid movement is implied).</p>
<A NAME="1816"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1743><b>sn</b> When Jesus said to those who came to arrest him &#8220;I am,&#8221; <i>they retreated and fell to the ground</i>. L. Morris says that &#8220;it is possible that those in front recoiled from Jesus&#8217; unexpected advance, so that they bumped those behind them, causing them to stumble and fall&#8221; (<i>John </i>[NICNT], 743-44). Perhaps this is what in fact happened on the scene; but the theological significance given to this event by the author implies that more is involved. The reaction on the part of those who came to arrest Jesus comes in response to his affirmation that he is indeed the one they are seeking, Jesus the Nazarene. But Jesus makes this affirmation of his identity using a formula which the reader has encountered before in the Fourth Gospel, e.g., 8:24, 28, 58. Jesus has applied to himself the divine Name of Exod 3:14, &#8220;I AM.&#8221; Therefore this amounts to something of a theophany which causes even his enemies to recoil and prostrate themselves, so that Jesus has to ask a second time, &#8220;Who are you looking for?&#8221; This is a vivid reminder to the reader of the Gospel that even in this dark hour, Jesus holds ultimate power over his enemies and the powers of darkness, because he is the one who bears the divine Name.</p>
<A NAME="1817"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1744><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;he&#8221;; the referent (Jesus) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="1818"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1745><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Jesus answered.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1819"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1746><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;if you are seeking.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1747><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;men&#8221; is not in the Greek text but is implied. The translation uses the word &#8220;men&#8221; here rather than a more generic word like &#8220;people&#8221; because in context Jesus referred only to the eleven remaining disciples who were loyal to him and were present at his arrest.</p>
<A NAME="1821"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1748><b>sn</b> A second time Jesus replied, &#8220;<i>I told you that I am he</i>,&#8221; identifying himself as the one they are seeking. Jesus also added, &#8220;<i>If you are looking for me, let these men go</i>.&#8221; Jesus successfully diverted attention from his disciples by getting the soldiers and officers of the chief priests to admit (twice) that it is only him they were after. Even in this hour Jesus still protected and cared for his own, giving himself up on their behalf. By handing himself over to his enemies, Jesus ensured that his disciples went free. From the perspective of the author, this is acting out beforehand what Jesus will actually do for his followers when he goes to the cross.</p>
<A NAME="1822"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1749><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;He said this&#8221; are not in the Greek text, but are implied. There is an ellipsis in the Greek text that must be supplied for the modern English reader at this point.</p>
<A NAME="1823"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1750><b>sn</b> This expression is similar to John 6:39 and John 17:12.</p>
<A NAME="1824"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1751><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Of the ones whom you gave me, I did not lose one of them.&#8221; The order of the clauses has been rearranged to reflect contemporary English style.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This action of Jesus on behalf of his disciples is interpreted by the author as a fulfillment of Jesus&#8217; own words: &#8220;<i>I have not lost a single one of those whom you gave me</i>.&#8221; Here it is Jesus&#8217; own words, rather than the OT scriptures, which are quoted. This same formula will be used by the author again of Jesus&#8217; words in 18:32, but the verb is used elsewhere in the Fourth Gospel to describe the NT fulfillment of OT passages (12:38, 13:18, 15:25, 17:12, 19:24, and 19:36). It is a bit difficult to determine the exact referent, since the words of Jesus quoted in this verse are not an exact reproduction of a saying of Jesus elsewhere in John&#8217;s Gospel. Although some have identified the saying with John 6:39, the closest parallel is in 17:12, where the betrayer, Judas, is specifically excluded. The words quoted here in 18:9 appear to be a free rendition of 17:12.</p>
<A NAME="1825"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1752><b>tn</b> See the note on the word &#8220;slaves&#8221; in 4:51.</p>
<A NAME="1826"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1753><b>sn</b> The account of the attack on the <i>high priest&#8217;s slave</i> contains details which suggest eyewitness testimony. It is also mentioned in all three synoptic gospels, but only John records that the disciple involved was Peter, whose impulsive behavior has already been alluded to (John 13:37). Likewise only John gives the name of the victim, <i>Malchus</i>, who is described as <i>the high priest&#8217;s slave</i>. John and Mark (14:47) both use the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8032;&#964;&#940;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">wtarion</font>, a double diminutive) to describe what was cut off, and this may indicate only part of the right ear (for example, the earlobe).</p>
<A NAME="1827"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1754><b>sn</b> This is a parenthetical note by the author.</p>
<A NAME="1828"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1755><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;The cup that the Father has given me to drink, shall I not drink it?&#8221; The order of the clauses has been rearranged to reflect contemporary English style.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b><i> </i>Jesus continues with what most would take to be a rhetorical question expecting a positive reply: &#8220;<i>Shall I not drink the cup that the Father has given me?</i>&#8221; The cup is also mentioned in Gethsemane in the synoptics (Matt 26:39, Mark 14:36, and Luke 22:42). In connection with the synoptic accounts it is mentioned in Jesus&#8217; prayer; this occurrence certainly complements the synoptic accounts if Jesus had only shortly before finished praying about this. Only here in the Fourth Gospel is it specifically said that the cup is given to Jesus to drink by the Father, but again this is consistent with the synoptic mention of the cup in Jesus&#8217; prayer: It is the cup of suffering which Jesus is about to undergo.</p>
<A NAME="1829"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1756><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;a cohort&#8221; (but since this was a unit of 600 soldiers, a smaller detachment is almost certainly intended).</p>

(For further information see R. G. Bratcher, &#8220;&#8216;The Jews&#8217; in the Gospel of John,&#8221; <i>BT </i>26 [1975]: 401-9.) Here the phrase refers to the Jewish leaders, who were named as &#8220;chief priests and Pharisees&#8221; in John 18:3.</p>

<A NAME="1835"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1762><b>sn</b> Jesus was taken first to <i>Annas</i>. Only the Gospel of John mentions this pretrial hearing before Annas, and that Annas was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who is said to be high priest in that year. Caiaphas is also mentioned as being high priest in John 11:49. But in 18:15, 16, 19, and 22 Annas is called high priest. Annas is also referred to as high priest by Luke in Acts 4:6. Many scholars have dismissed these references as mistakes on the part of both Luke and John, but as mentioned above, John 11:49 and 18:13 indicate that John knew that Caiaphas was high priest in the year that Jesus was crucified. This has led others to suggest that Annas and Caiaphas shared the high priesthood, but there is no historical evidence to support this view. Annas had been high priest from <sc>a.d. 6 to <sc>a.d. 15 when he was deposed by the Roman prefect Valerius Gratus (according to Josephus, <i>Ant.</i> 18.2.2 [18.34]). His five sons all eventually became high priests. The family was noted for its greed, wealth, and power. There are a number of ways the references in both Luke and John to Annas being high priest may be explained. Some Jews may have refused to recognize the changes in high priests effected by the Roman authorities, since according to the Torah the high priesthood was a lifetime office (Num 25:13). Another possibility is that it was simply customary to retain the title after a person had left the office as a courtesy, much as retired ambassadors are referred to as &#8220;Mr. Ambassador&#8221; or ex-presidents as &#8220;Mr. President.&#8221; Finally, the use of the title by Luke and John may simply be a reflection of the real power behind the high priesthood of the time: Although Annas no longer technically held the office, he may well have managed to control those relatives of his who did hold it from behind the scenes. In fact this seems most probable and would also explain why Jesus was brought to him immediately after his arrest for a sort of &#8220;pretrial hearing&#8221; before being sent on to the entire Sanhedrin.</p>
<A NAME="1836"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1763><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;counseled.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1837"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1764><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the Jews.&#8221; Here the phrase refers to the Jewish leaders, specifically members of the Sanhedrin (see John 11:49-50). See also the note on the phrase &#8220;Jewish leaders&#8221; in v. 12.</p>
<A NAME="1838"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1765><b>sn</b> This is a parenthetical note by the author.</p>
<A NAME="1839"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1766><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;them as they brought Jesus to Annas&#8221; are not in the Greek text, but are supplied to clarify who Peter and the other disciple were following. Direct objects were often omitted in Greek when clear from the context.</p>
<A NAME="1840"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1767><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;that disciple.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Many have associated this unnamed <i>other disciple</i> with the beloved disciple, that is, John son of Zebedee, mainly because the phrase <i>the other disciple</i> which occurs here is also used to describe the beloved disciple in John 20:2, 3, 4, and 8. Peter is also closely associated with the beloved disciple in 13:23-26, 20:2-10, 21:7, and 21:20-23. But other identifications have also been proposed, chiefly because v. 16 states that this disciple who was accompanied by Peter was known to the high priest. As C. K. Barrett (<i>St. John</i>, 525) points out, the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#957;&#969;&#963;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">gnwstos</font>) is used in the LXX to refer to a close friend (Ps 54:14 LXX [55:14 ET]). This raises what for some is an insurmountable difficulty in identifying the &#8220;other disciple&#8221; as John son of Zebedee, since how could the uneducated son of an obscure Galilean fisherman be known to such a powerful and influential family in Jerusalem? E. A. Abbott (as quoted in &#8220;Notes of Recent Exposition,&#8221; <i>ExpTim </i>25 [1913/14]: 149-50) proposed that the &#8220;other disciple&#8221; who accompanied Peter was Judas, since he was the one disciple of whom it is said explicitly (in the synoptic accounts) that he had dealings with the high priest. E. A. Tindall (&#8220;Contributions and Comments: John xviii.15,&#8221; <i>ExpTim </i>28 [1916/17]: 283-84) suggested the disciple was Nicodemus, who as a member of the Sanhedrin, would have had access to the high priest&#8217;s palace. Both of these suggestions, while ingenious, nevertheless lack support from the text of the Fourth Gospel itself or the synoptic accounts. W. Wuellner (<i>The Meaning of </i>&#8220;<i>Fishers of Men</i>&#8221; [NTL]) argues that the common attitude concerning the low social status and ignorance of the disciples from Galilee may in fact be a misconception. Zebedee is presented in Mark 1:20 as a man wealthy enough to have hired servants, and Mark 10:35-45 presents both of the sons of Zebedee as concerned about status and prestige. John&#8217;s mother appears in the same light in Matt 20:20-28. Contact with the high priestly family in Jerusalem might not be so unlikely in such circumstances. Others have noted the possibility that John came from a priestly family, some of which is based upon a statement in Eusebius (<i>Ecclesiastical History </i>3.31.3) quoting Polycrates that John son of Zebedee was a priest. For further information on possible priestly connections among members of John&#8217;s family see L. Morris (<i>John </i>[NICNT], 752, n. 32). None of this is certain, but on the whole it seems most probable that the disciple who accompanied Peter and gained entry into the courtyard for him was John son of Zebedee.</p>

At this time on the eve of the feast he would have been a busy and perhaps even a worried man. It is not surprising that he offered to hand Jesus back over to the Jewish authorities to pass judgment on him. It may well be that Pilate realized when no specific charge was mentioned that he was dealing with an internal dispute over some religious matter. Pilate wanted nothing to do with such matters, as the statement &#8220;<i>Pass judgment on him according to your own law!</i>&#8221; indicates. As far as the author is concerned, this points out who was really responsible for Jesus&#8217; death: The Roman governor Pilate would have had nothing to do with it if he had not been pressured by the Jewish religious authorities, upon whom the real responsibility rested.</p>

Scholars are divided over whether this statement in the Fourth Gospel accurately reflects the judicial situation between the Jewish authorities and the Romans in 1st century Palestine. It appears that the Roman governor may have given the Jews the power of capital punishment for specific offenses, some of them religious (the death penalty for Gentiles caught trespassing in the inner courts of the temple, for example). It is also pointed out that the Jewish authorities did carry out a number of executions, some of them specifically pertaining to Christians (Stephen, according to Acts 7:58-60; and James the Just, who was stoned in the 60s according to Josephus, <i>Ant.</i> 20.9.1 [20.200]). But Stephen&#8217;s death may be explained as a result of &#8220;mob violence&#8221; rather than a formal execution, and as Josephus in the above account goes on to point out, James was executed in the period between two Roman governors, and the high priest at the time was subsequently punished for the action. Two studies by A. N. Sherwin-White (<i>Roman Society and Roman Law in the New Testament</i>, 1-47; and &#8220;The Trial of Christ,&#8221; <i>Historicity and Chronology in the New Testament</i> [SPCKTC], 97-116) have tended to support the accuracy of John&#8217;s account. He concluded that the Romans kept very close control of the death penalty for fear that in the hands of rebellious locals such power could be used to eliminate factions favorable or useful to Rome. A province as troublesome as Judea would not have been likely to be made an exception to this.</p>

These references may explain the lack of extra-biblical attestation: The custom to which Pilate refers here (18:39) is not a permanent one acknowledged by all the Roman governors, but one peculiar to Pilate as a means of appeasement, meant to better relations with his subjects.
