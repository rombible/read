<A NAME="35"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=188><b>sn</b> The reference to <i>signs</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#951;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#945;</font>, <font face="Greektl">shmeia</font>) forms a link with John 2:23-25. Those people in Jerusalem believed in Jesus because of the signs he had performed. Nicodemus had apparently seen them too. But for Nicodemus all the signs meant is that Jesus was a great teacher sent from God. His approach to Jesus was well-intentioned but theologically inadequate; he had failed to grasp the messianic implications of the miraculous signs.</p>
