<A NAME="334"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">34</span><note=217><b>sn</b> <i>So must the Son of Man be lifted up. </i>This is ultimately a prediction of Jesus&#8217; crucifixion. Nicodemus could not have understood this, but John&#8217;s readers, the audience to whom the Gospel is addressed, certainly could have (compare the wording of John 12:32). In John, being <i>lifted up</i> refers to one continuous action of ascent, beginning with the cross but ending at the right hand of the Father. Step 1 is Jesus&#8217; death; step 2 is his resurrection; and step 3 is the ascension back to heaven. It is the upward swing of the &#8220;pendulum&#8221; which began with the incarnation, the descent of the Word become flesh from heaven to earth (cf. Paul in Phil 2:5-11). See also the note on the title <i>Son of Man</i> in 1:51.</p>
