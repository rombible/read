<A NAME="34"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=187><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;during the night.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Possibly Nicodemus <i>came</i>&#8230;<i>at night</i> because he was afraid of public association with Jesus, or he wanted a lengthy discussion without interruptions; no explanation for the timing of the interview is given by the author. But the timing is significant for John in terms of the light-darkness motif &#8211; compare John 9:4, 11:10, 13:30 (especially), 19:39, and 21:3. Out of the darkness of his life and religiosity Nicodemus came to the Light of the world. The author probably had multiple meanings or associations in mind here, as is often the case.</p>
