<A NAME="349"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=232><b>tn</b> The precise locations of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#913;&#7984;&#957;&#8061;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Ainwn</font>) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#931;&#945;&#955;&#949;&#943;&#956;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Saleim</font>) are unknown. Three possibilities are suggested: (1) In Perea, which is in Transjordan (cf. 1:28). Perea is just across the river from Judea. (2) In the northern Jordan Valley, on the west bank some 8 miles [13 km] south of Scythopolis. But with the Jordan River so close, the reference to abundant water (3:23) seems superfluous. (3) Thus Samaria has been suggested. 4 miles (6.6 km) east of Shechem is a town called Salim, and 8 miles (13 km) northeast of Salim lies modern Ainun. In the general vicinity are many springs. Because of the meanings of the names (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#913;&#7984;&#957;&#8061;&#957;</font> = &#8220;springs&#8221; in Aramaic and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#931;&#945;&#955;&#949;&#943;&#956;</font> = Salem, &#8220;peace&#8221;) some have attempted to allegorize here that John the Baptist is <i>near</i> salvation. Obviously there is no need for this. It is far more probable that the author has in mind real places, even if their locations cannot be determined with certainty.</p>
