<A NAME="312"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=195><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;born of water and wind&#8221; (the same Greek word, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#957;&#949;&#973;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962;</font> [<font face="Greektl">pneumatos</font>], may be translated either &#8220;spirit/Spirit&#8221; or &#8220;wind&#8221;). </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Jesus&#8217; somewhat enigmatic statement points to the necessity of being born &#8220;from above,&#8221; because <i>water</i> and <i>wind/spirit/Spirit</i> come from above. Isaiah 44:3-5 and Ezek 37:9-10 are pertinent examples of <i>water</i> and <i>wind</i> as life-giving symbols of the Spirit of God in his work among people. Both occur in contexts that deal with the future restoration of Israel as a nation prior to the establishment of the messianic kingdom. It is therefore particularly appropriate that Jesus should introduce them in a conversation about entering the kingdom of God. Note that the Greek word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#957;&#949;&#973;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962;</font> is anarthrous (has no article) in v. 5. This does not mean that <i>spirit</i> in the verse should be read as a <i>direct</i> reference to the Holy Spirit, but that both water and wind are figures (based on passages in the OT, which Nicodemus, <i>the teacher of Israel</i> should have known) that represent the regenerating work of the Spirit in the lives of men and women.</p>
