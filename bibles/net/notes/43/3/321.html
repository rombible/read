<A NAME="321"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=204><b>sn</b> Jesus&#8217; question <i>&#8220;Are you the teacher of Israel and yet you don&#8217;t understand these things?&#8221;</i> implies that Nicodemus had enough information at his disposal from the OT scriptures to have understood Jesus&#8217; statements about the necessity of being born from above by the regenerating work of the Spirit. Isa 44:3-5 and Ezek 37:9-10 are passages Nicodemus might have known which would have given him insight into Jesus&#8217; words. Another significant passage which contains many of these concepts is Prov 30:4-5.</p>
