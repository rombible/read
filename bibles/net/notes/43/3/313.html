<A NAME="313"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=196><b>sn</b> <i>What is born of the flesh is flesh</i>,<i> </i>i.e., what is born of physical heritage is physical. (It is interesting to compare this terminology with that of the dialogue in John 4, especially 4:23, 24.) For John the &#8220;flesh&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#940;&#961;&#958;</font>, <font face="Greektl">sarx</font>) emphasizes merely the weakness and mortality of the creature &#8211; a neutral term, not necessarily sinful as in Paul. This is confirmed by the reference in John 1:14 to the <i>Logos</i> becoming &#8220;flesh.&#8221; The author avoids associating sinfulness with the incarnate Christ.</p>
