<A NAME="346"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=229><b>sn</b> <i>John 3:16-21</i> provides an introduction to the (so-called) &#8220;realized&#8221; eschatology of the Fourth Gospel: Judgment has come; eternal life may be possessed now, in the present life, as well as in the future. The terminology &#8220;realized eschatology&#8221; was originally coined by E. Haenchen and used by J. Jeremias in discussion with C. H. Dodd, but is now characteristically used to describe Dodd&#8217;s own formulation. See L. Goppelt, <i>Theology of the New Testament</i>, 1:54, note 10, and R. E. Brown (<i>John </i>[AB], 1:cxvii-cxviii) for further discussion. Especially important to note is the element of choice portrayed in John&#8217;s Gospel. If there is a twofold reaction to Jesus in John&#8217;s Gospel, it should be emphasized that that reaction is very much dependent on a person&#8217;s choice, a choice that is influenced by his way of life, whether his deeds are wicked or are done in God (John 3:20-21). For John there is virtually no trace of determinism at the surface. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one find statements like &#8220;no one can come to me, unless the Father who sent me draws him&#8221; (John 6:44).</p>
