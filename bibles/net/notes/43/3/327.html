<A NAME="327"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=210><b>sn</b> Obviously <i>earthly things</i> and <i>heavenly things </i>are in contrast, but what is the contrast? What are <i>earthly things</i> which Jesus has just spoken to Nicodemus? And through him to others &#8211; this is not the first instance of the plural pronoun, see v. 7, <i>you must all</i>. Since Nicodemus began with a plural (<i>we know</i>, v. 2) Jesus continues it, and through Nicodemus addresses a broader audience. It makes most sense to take this as a reference to the things Jesus has just said (and the things he is about to say, vv. 13-15). If this is the case (and it seems the most natural explanation) then <i>earthly things</i> are not necessarily strictly <i>physical</i> things, but are so called because they take place on earth, in contrast to things like v. 16, which take place in heaven. Some have added the suggestion that the things are called <i>earthly</i> because physical analogies (birth, wind, water) are used to describe them. This is possible, but it seems more probable that Jesus calls these things <i>earthly</i> because they happen on earth (even though they are spiritual things). In the context, taking <i>earthly things</i> as referring to the words Jesus has just spoken fits with the fact that Nicodemus did not believe. And he would not after hearing <i>heavenly things</i> either, unless he first believed in the <i>earthly things</i> &#8211; which included the necessity of a regenerating work from above, by the Holy Spirit.</p>
