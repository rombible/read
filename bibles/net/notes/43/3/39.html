<A NAME="39"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=192><b>sn</b> What does Jesus&#8217; statement about not being able to <i>see the kingdom of God</i> mean within the framework of John&#8217;s Gospel? John uses the word <i>kingdom</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#946;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#955;&#949;&#943;&#945;</font>, <font face="Greektl">basileia</font>) only 5 times (3:3, 5; 18:36 [3x]). Only here is it qualified with the phrase <i>of God</i>. The fact that John does not stress the concept of the <i>kingdom of God</i> does not mean it is absent from his theology, however. Remember the messianic implications found in John 2, both the wedding and miracle at Cana and the cleansing of the temple. For Nicodemus, the term must surely have brought to mind the messianic kingdom which Messiah was supposed to bring. But Nicodemus had missed <i>precisely</i> this point about <i>who</i> Jesus was. It was the Messiah himself with whom Nicodemus was speaking. Whatever Nicodemus understood, it is clear that the point is this: He misunderstood Jesus&#8217; words. He over-literalized them, and thought Jesus was talking about repeated physical birth, when he was in fact referring to new spiritual birth.</p>
