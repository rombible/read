<A NAME="329"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=212><b>sn</b> The verb <i>ascended</i> is a perfect tense in Greek (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#945;&#946;&#941;&#946;&#951;&#954;&#949;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">anabebhken</font>) which seems to look at a past, completed event. (This is not as much of a problem for those who take Jesus&#8217; words to end at v. 12, and these words to be a comment by the author, looking back on Jesus&#8217; ascension.) As a saying of Jesus, these words are a bit harder to explain. Note, however, the lexical similarities with 1:51: &#8220;ascending,&#8221; &#8220;descending,&#8221; and &#8220;son of man.&#8221; Here, though, the ascent and descent is accomplished by the Son himself, not the angels as in 1:51. There is no need to limit this saying to Jesus&#8217; ascent following the resurrection, however; the point of the Jacob story (Gen 28), which seems to be the background for 1:51, is the freedom of communication and relationship between God and men (a major theme of John&#8217;s Gospel). This communication comes through the angels in Gen 28 (and John 1:51); but here (most appropriately) it comes directly through <i>the Son of Man</i>. Although Jesus could be referring to a prior ascent, after an appearance as the preincarnate Son of Man, more likely he is simply pointing out that no one from earth has ever gone up to heaven and come down again. The Son, who has come down from heaven, is the only one who has been &#8216;up&#8217; there. In both Jewish intertestamental literature and later rabbinic accounts, Moses is portrayed as ascending to heaven to receive the Torah and descending to distribute it to men (e.g., <i>Targum</i> Ps 68:19.) In contrast to these Jewish legends, the Son is the only one who has ever made the ascent and descent.</p>
