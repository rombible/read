<A NAME="337"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=220><b>tn</b> Although this word is often translated &#8220;only begotten,&#8221; such a translation is misleading, since in English it appears to express a metaphysical relationship. The word in Greek was used of an only child (a son [Luke 7:12, 9:38] or a daughter [Luke 8:42]). It was also used of something unique (only one of its kind) such as the mythological Phoenix (1 Clement 25:2). From here it passes easily to a description of Isaac (Heb 11:17 and Josephus, <i>Ant.</i> 1.13.1 [1.222]) who was not Abraham&#8217;s <i>only</i> son, but was one-of-a-kind because he was the child of the promise. Thus the word means &#8220;one-of-a-kind&#8221; and is reserved for Jesus in the Johannine literature of the NT. While all Christians are children of God (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#941;&#954;&#957;&#945; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font>, <font face="Greektl">tekna qeou</font>), Jesus is God&#8217;s Son in a unique, one-of-a-kind sense. The word is used in this way in all its uses in the Gospel of John (1:14, 1:18, 3:16, and 3:18).</p>
