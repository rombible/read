<A NAME="38"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=191><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#957;&#969;&#952;&#949;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anwqen</font>) has a double meaning, either &#8220;again&#8221; (in which case it is synonymous with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#955;&#943;&#957;</font> [<font face="Greektl">palin</font>]) or &#8220;from above&#8221; (BDAG 92 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#957;&#969;&#952;&#949;&#957;</font>). This is a favorite technique of the author of the Fourth Gospel, and it is lost in almost all translations at this point. John uses the word 5 times, in 3:3, 7; 3:31; 19:11 and 23. In the latter 3 cases the context makes clear that it means &#8220;from above.&#8221; Here (3:3, 7) it could mean either, but the primary meaning intended by Jesus is &#8220;from above.&#8221; Nicodemus apparently understood it the other way, which explains his reply, &#8220;How can a man be born when he is old? He can&#8217;t enter his mother&#8217;s womb a second time and be born, can he?&#8221; The author uses the technique of the &#8220;misunderstood question&#8221; often to bring out a particularly important point: Jesus says something which is misunderstood by the disciples or (as here) someone else, which then gives Jesus the opportunity to explain more fully and in more detail what he really meant.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Or<i> born again.</i> The Greek word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#957;&#969;&#952;&#949;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anwqen</font>) can mean both &#8220;again&#8221; and &#8220;from above,&#8221; giving rise to Nicodemus&#8217; misunderstanding about a second physical birth (v. 4).</p>
