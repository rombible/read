<A NAME="336"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=219><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;this is how much&#8221;; or &#8220;in this way.&#8221; The Greek adverb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8021;&#964;&#969;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joutws</font>) can refer (1) to the <i>degree </i>to which God loved the world, that is, to such an <i>extent</i> or <i>so much </i>that he gave his own Son (see R. E. Brown, <i>John </i>[AB], 1:133-34; D. A. Carson, <i>John</i>, 204) or (2) simply to the <i>manner </i>in which God loved the world, i.e., by sending his own son (see R. H. Gundry and R. W. Howell, &#8220;The Sense and Syntax of John 3:14-17 with Special Reference to the Use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#927;&#8021;&#964;&#969;&#962;</font>&#8230;<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8037;&#963;&#964;&#949;</font> in John 3:16,&#8221; <i>NovT </i>41 [1999]: 24-39)<b>.</b> Though the term more frequently refers to the manner in which something is done (see BDAG 741-42 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8021;&#964;&#969;</font>/<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8021;&#964;&#969;&#962;</font>), the following clause involving <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8037;&#963;&#964;&#949;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jwste</font>) plus the indicative (which stresses actual, but [usually] unexpected result) emphasizes the greatness of the gift God has given. With this in mind, then, it is likely (3) that John is emphasizing both the <i>degree </i>to which God loved the world as well as the <i>manner</i> in which He chose to express that love. This is in keeping with John&#8217;s style of using double entendre or double meaning. Thus, the focus of the Greek construction here is on the <i>nature</i> of God's love, addressing its mode, intensity, and extent.</p>
