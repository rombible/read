<A NAME="1387"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">87</span><note=1411><b>sn</b> The idea that love is a <i>commandment</i> is interesting. In the OT the ten commandments have a setting in the covenant between God and Israel at Sinai; they were the stipulations that Israel had to observe if the nation were to be God&#8217;s chosen people. In speaking of love as the <i>new commandment</i> for those whom Jesus had chosen as his own (John 13:1, 15:16) and as a mark by which they could be distinguished from others (13:35), John shows that he is thinking of this scene in covenant terminology. But note that the disciples are to love &#8220;<i>Just as I have loved you</i>&#8221; (13:34). The love Jesus has for his followers cannot be duplicated by them in one sense, because it effects their salvation, since he lays down his life for them: It is an act of love that gives life to people. But in another sense, they can follow his example (recall <i>to the end, </i>13:1; also 1 John 3:16, 4:16 and the interpretation of Jesus&#8217; washing of the disciples&#8217; feet). In this way Jesus&#8217; disciples are to love one another: They are to follow his example of sacrificial service to one another, to death if necessary.</p>
