<A NAME="1336"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">36</span><note=1360><b>sn</b> <i>I have given you an example. </i>Jesus tells his disciples after he has finished washing their feet that what he has done is to set an <i>example</i> for them. In the previous verse he told them they were to <i>wash one another&#8217;s feet</i>. What is the point of the example? If it is simply an act of humble service, as most interpret the significance, then Jesus is really telling his disciples to serve one another in humility rather than seeking preeminence over one another. If, however, the example is one of self-sacrifice up to the point of death, then Jesus is telling them to lay down their lives for one another (cf. 15:13).</p>
