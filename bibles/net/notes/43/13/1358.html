<A NAME="1358"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=1382><b>sn</b> It is not clear where <i>Simon Peter</i> was seated. If he were on Jesus&#8217; other side, it is difficult to see why he would not have asked the question himself. It would also have been difficult to beckon to the beloved disciple, on Jesus&#8217; right, from such a position. So apparently Peter was seated somewhere else. It is entirely possible that Judas was seated to Jesus&#8217; left. Matt 26:25 seems to indicate that Jesus could speak to him without being overheard by the rest of the group. Judas is evidently in a position where Jesus can hand him the morsel of food (13:26).</p>
