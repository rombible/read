<A NAME="1311"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1335><b>tn</b> The plural <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8048; &#7985;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#953;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ta Jimatia</font>) is probably a reference to more than one garment (cf. John 19:23-24). If so, this would indicate that Jesus stripped to a loincloth, like a slave. The translation &#8220;outer clothes&#8221; is used to indicate that Jesus was not completely naked, since complete nudity would have been extremely offensive to Jewish sensibilities in this historical context.</p>
