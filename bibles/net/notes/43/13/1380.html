<A NAME="1380"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">80</span><note=1404><b>tc</b> A number of early <sc>mss (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>66</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* B C* D L W <i>al </i>as well as several versional witnesses) do not have the words &#8220;If God is glorified in him,&#8221; while the majority of <sc>mss have the clause (so <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>2 </sup>A C<sup>2</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13 </sup>33 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat). Although the <sc>mss that omit the words are significantly better witnesses, the omission may have occurred because of an error of sight due to homoioteleuton (v. 31 ends in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183;</font> [<font face="Greektl">en autw</font>, &#8220;in him&#8221;], as does this clause). Further, the typical step-parallelism found in John is retained if the clause is kept intact (<i>TCGNT</i> 205-6). At the same time, it is difficult to explain how such a wide variety of witnesses would have accidentally deleted this clause, and arguments for intentional deletion are not particularly convincing. NA<sup>27</sup> rightly places the words in brackets, indicating doubt as to their authenticity.</p>
