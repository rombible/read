<A NAME="1326"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1350><b>sn</b> <i>The one who has bathed needs only to wash his feet. </i>A common understanding is that the &#8220;bath&#8221; Jesus referred to is the initial cleansing from sin, which necessitates only &#8220;lesser, partial&#8221; cleansings from sins after conversion. This makes a fine illustration from a homiletic standpoint, but is it the meaning of the passage? This seems highly doubtful. Jesus stated that the disciples were <i>completely clean</i> except for Judas (vv. 10b, 11). What they needed was to have their feet washed by Jesus. In the broader context of the Fourth Gospel, the significance of the foot-washing seems to point not just to an example of humble service (as most understand it), but something more &#8211; Jesus&#8217; self-sacrificial death on the cross. If this is correct, then the foot-washing which they needed to undergo represented their <i>acceptance</i> of this act of self-sacrifice on the part of their master. This makes Peter&#8217;s initial abhorrence of the act of humiliation by his master all the more significant in context; it also explains Jesus&#8217; seemingly harsh reply to Peter (above, v. 8; compare Matt 16:21-23 where Jesus says to Peter, &#8220;Get behind me, Satan&#8221;).</p>
