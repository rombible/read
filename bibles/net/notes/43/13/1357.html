<A NAME="1357"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=1381><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;was reclining in the bosom (or &#8220;lap&#8221;) of Jesus&#8221; (according to both L&amp;N 17.25 and BDAG 65 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#940;&#954;&#949;&#953;&#956;&#945;&#953;</font> 2 an idiom for taking the place of honor at a meal, but note the similar expression in John 1:18). Whether this position or the position to the left of Jesus should be regarded as the position of second highest honor (next to the host, in this case Jesus, who was in the position of highest honor) is debated. F. Prat, &#8220;Les places d&#8217;honneur chez les Juifs contemporains du Christ&#8221; (<i>RSR</i> 15 [1925]: 512-22), who argued that the table arrangement was that of the Roman <i>triclinium</i> (a U-shaped table with Jesus and two other disciples at the bottom of the U), considered the position to the left of Jesus to be the one of second highest honor. Thus the present translation renders this &#8220;a position of honor&#8221; without specifying which one (since both of the two disciples to the right and to the left of Jesus would be in positions of honor). Other translations differ as to how they handle the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#8183; &#954;&#972;&#955;&#960;&#8179; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">en tw kolpw tou Ihsou</font>; &#8220;leaning on Jesus&#8217; bosom,&#8221; KJV; &#8220;lying close to the breast of Jesus,&#8221; RSV; &#8220;reclining on Jesus&#8217; breast,&#8221; NASB; &#8220;reclining next to him,&#8221; NIV, NRSV) but the symbolic significance of the beloved disciple&#8217;s position seems clear. He is close to Jesus and in an honored position. The phrase as an idiom for a place of honor at a feast is attested in the <i>Epistles</i> of Pliny (the Younger) 4.22.4, an approximate contemporary of Paul.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Note that the same expression translated <i>in a place of honor</i> here (<i>Grk </i>&#8220;in the bosom of&#8221;) is used to indicate Jesus&#8217; relationship with the Father in 1:18.</p>
