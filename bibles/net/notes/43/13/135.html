<A NAME="135"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1329><b>sn</b> At this point <i>the devil had already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon&#8217;s son, that he should betray Jesus</i>. C. K. Barrett (<i>St. John</i>, 365) thought this was a reference to the idea entering the devil&#8217;s own heart, but this does not seem likely. It is more probable that Judas&#8217; heart is meant, since the use of the Greek article (rather than a possessive pronoun) is a typical idiom when a part of one&#8217;s own body is indicated. Judas&#8217; name is withheld until the end of the sentence for dramatic effect (emphasis). This action must be read in light of 13:27, and appears to refer to a preliminary idea or plan.</p>
