All of John 13:1 is a single sentence in Greek, although in English this would be unacceptably awkward. At the end of the verse the idiom <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#962; &#964;&#941;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">eis telos</font>) was translated literally as &#8220;to the end&#8221; and the modern equivalents given in the note above, because there is an important lexical link between this passage and John 19:30, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#949;&#964;&#941;&#955;&#949;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">tetelestai</font>, &#8220;It is ended&#8221;). </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The full extent of Jesus&#8217; love for his disciples is not merely seen in his humble service to them in washing their feet (the most common interpretation of the passage). The full extent of his love for them is demonstrated in his sacrificial death for them on the cross. The footwashing episode which follows then becomes a prophetic act, or acting out beforehand, of his upcoming death on their behalf. The message for the disciples was that they were to love one another not just in humble, self-effacing service, but were to be willing to die for one another. At least one of them got this message eventually, though none understood it at the time (see 1 John 3:16).</p>
