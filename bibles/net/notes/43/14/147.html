<A NAME="147"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1423><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;If not, would I have told you that I am going to prepare a place for you?&#8221; What is the meaning of the last clause with or without the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font>? One of the questions that must be answered here is whether or not <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#972;&#960;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">topos</font>) is to be equated with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#959;&#957;&#8053;</font> (<font face="Greektl">monh</font>). In Rev 12:8 <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#972;&#960;&#959;&#962;</font> is used to refer to a place in heaven, which would suggest that the two are essentially equal here. Jesus is going ahead of believers to prepare a place for them, a permanent dwelling place in the Father&#8217;s house (see the note on this phrase in v. 2).</p>
