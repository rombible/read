<A NAME="144"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1420><b>sn</b> Most interpreters have understood the reference to <i>my Father&#8217;s house</i> as a reference to heaven, and the <i>dwelling places</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#959;&#957;&#8053;</font>, <font face="Greektl">monh</font>) as the permanent residences of believers there. This seems consistent with the vocabulary and the context, where in v. 3 Jesus speaks of coming again to take the disciples to himself. However, the phrase <i>in my Father&#8217;s house</i> was used previously in the Fourth Gospel in 2:16 to refer to the temple in Jerusalem. The author in 2:19-22 then reinterpreted the temple as Jesus&#8217; body, which was to be destroyed in death and then rebuilt in resurrection after three days. Even more suggestive is the statement by Jesus in 8:35, &#8220;Now the slave does not remain (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#941;&#957;&#969;</font>, <font face="Greektl">menw</font>) in the household forever, but the son remains (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#941;&#957;&#969;</font>) forever.&#8221; If in the imagery of the Fourth Gospel the phrase <i>in my Father&#8217;s house</i> is ultimately a reference to Jesus&#8217; body, the relationship of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#959;&#957;&#8053;</font> to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#941;&#957;&#969;</font> suggests the permanent relationship of the believer to Jesus and the Father as an adopted son who remains in the household forever. In this case the &#8220;dwelling place&#8221; is &#8220;in&#8221; Jesus himself, where he is, whether in heaven or on earth. The statement in v. 3, &#8220;I will come again and receive you to myself,&#8221; then refers not just to the parousia, but also to Jesus&#8217; postresurrection return to the disciples in his glorified state, when by virtue of his death on their behalf they may enter into union with him and with the Father as adopted sons. Needless to say, this bears numerous similarities to Pauline theology, especially the concepts of adoption as sons and being &#8220;in Christ&#8221; which are prominent in passages like Eph 1. It is also important to note, however, the emphasis in the Fourth Gospel itself on the present reality of eternal life (John 5:24, 7:38-39, etc.) and the possibility of worshiping the Father &#8220;in the Spirit and in truth&#8221; (John 4:21-24) in the present age. There is a sense in which it is possible to say that the future reality is present now. See further J. McCaffrey, <i>The House With Many Rooms</i> (AnBib 114).</p>
