The difference between this reading and the wording in NA<sup>27</sup> (supported by <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>66c</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B C* L Q W 33 579 <i>pc</i>) is the addition of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> before <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8052;&#957; &#8001;&#948;&#972;&#957;</font> and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#7988;&#948;&#945;&#964;&#949;</font> after. Either assertion on the part of Jesus would be understandable: &#8220;you know the way where I am going&#8221; or &#8220;you know where I am going and you know the way,&#8221; although the shorter reading is a bit more awkward syntactically. In light of this, and in light of the expansion already at hand in v. 5, the longer reading appears to be a motivated reading. The shorter reading is thus preferred because of its superior external and internal evidence.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Where I am going. </i>Jesus had spoken of his destination previously to the disciples, most recently in John 13:33. Where he was going was back to the Father, and they could not follow him there, but later he would return for them and they could join him then. The <i>way</i> he was going was via the cross. This he had also mentioned previously (e.g., 12:32) although his disciples did not understand at the time (cf. 12:33). As Jesus would explain in v. 6, although for him the <i>way</i> back to the Father was via the cross, for his disciples the &#8220;way&#8221; to where he was going was Jesus himself.</p>
