<A NAME="145"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=1421><b>tc</b> A number of important <sc>mss (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>66c</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> </font>A B C* D K L W <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936; </font><font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13 </sup>33 565 579 892 <i>al</i> lat) have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joti</font>) here, while the majority lack it (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup><font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">66</font>*</sup> C<sup>2 </sup><font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920; </font><font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>). Should the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> be included or omitted? The external evidence is significantly stronger for the longer reading. Most Alexandrian and Western <sc>mss favor inclusion (it is a little unusual for the Alexandrian to favor the <i>longer</i> reading), while most Byzantine <sc>mss favor omission (again, a little unusual). However, the reading of <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>66*</sup>, which aligns with the Byzantine, needs to be given some value. At the same time, the scribe of this papyrus was known for freely omitting and adding words, and the fact that the ms was corrected discounts its testimony here. But because the shorter reading is out of character for the Byzantine text, the shorter reading (omitting the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font>) may well be authentic. Internally, the question comes down to whether the shorter reading is more difficult or not. And here, it loses the battle, for it seems to be a clarifying omission (so <i>TCGNT</i> 206). R. E. Brown is certainly right when he states: &#8220;all in all, the translation without <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> makes the best sense&#8221; (<i>John </i>[AB], 2:620). But this tacitly argues for the authenticity of the word. Thus, on both external and internal grounds, the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953; </font>should be regarded as authentic. </p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> If the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Joti</font>) is included (see <b>tc</b> above), there are no less than four possible translations for this sentence: The sentence could be either a question or a statement, and in addition the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> could either indicate content or be causal. How does one determine the best translation? (1) A question here should probably be ruled out because it would imply a previous statement by Jesus that either there are many dwelling places in his Father&#8217;s house (if the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953; </font>is causal) or he was going off to make a place ready for them (if the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> indicates content). There is no indication anywhere in the Fourth Gospel that Jesus had made such statements prior to this time. So understanding the sentence as a statement is the best option. (2) A statement with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> indicating content is understandable but contradictory. If there were no dwelling places, Jesus would have told them that he was going off to make dwelling places. But the following verse makes clear that Jesus&#8217; departure is not hypothetical but real &#8211; he is really going away. So understanding the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> with a causal nuance is the best option. (3) A statement with a causal <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> can be understood two ways: (a) &#8220;Otherwise I would have told you&#8221; is a parenthetical statement, and the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause goes with the preceding &#8220;There are many dwelling places in my Father&#8217;s house.&#8221; This would be fairly awkward syntactically, however; it would be much more natural for the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> clause to modify what directly preceded it. (b) &#8220;Otherwise I would have told you&#8221; is explained by Jesus&#8217; statement that he is going to make ready a place. He makes a logical, necessary connection between his future departure and the reality of the dwelling places in his Father&#8217;s house. To sum up, all the possibilities for understanding the verse with the inclusion of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</font> present some interpretive difficulties, but last option given seems best: &#8220;Otherwise, I would have told you, because I am going to make ready a place.&#8221; Of all the options it provides the best logical flow of thought in the passage without making any apparent contradictions in the context.</p>
