<A NAME="1476"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">76</span><note=1492><b>sn</b> Some have understood Jesus&#8217; statement <i>Get up, let us go from here</i> to mean that at this point Jesus and the disciples got up and left the room where the meal was served and began the journey to the garden of Gethsemane. If so, the rest of the Farewell Discourse took place <i>en route</i>. Others have pointed to this statement as one of the &#8220;seams&#8221; in the discourse, indicating that the author used preexisting sources. Both explanations are possible, but not really necessary. Jesus could simply have stood up at this point (the disciples may or may not have stood with him) to finish the discourse before finally departing (in 18:1). In any case it may be argued that Jesus refers not to a literal departure at this point, but to preparing to meet the enemy who is on the way already in the person of Judas and the soldiers with him.</p>
