<A NAME="143"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1419><b>tn</b> Many interpreters have associated <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#959;&#957;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">monai</font>) with an Aramaic word that can refer to a stopping place or resting place for a traveler on a journey. This is similar to one of the meanings the word can have in secular Greek (Pausanius 10.31.7). Origen understood the use here to refer to stations on the road to God. This may well have been the understanding of the Latin translators who translated <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#959;&#957;&#8053;</font> (<font face="Greektl">monh</font>) by <i>mansio</i>, a stopping place. The English translation &#8220;mansions&#8221; can be traced back to Tyndale, but in Middle English the word simply meant &#8220;a dwelling place&#8221; (not necessarily large or imposing) with no connotation of being temporary. The interpretation put forward by Origen would have been well suited to Gnosticism, where the soul in its ascent passes through stages during which it is gradually purified of all that is material and therefore evil. It is much more likely that the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#959;&#957;&#8053;</font> should be related to its cognate verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#941;&#957;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">menw</font>), which is frequently used in the Fourth Gospel to refer to the permanence of relationship between Jesus and the Father and/or Jesus and the believer. Thus the idea of a permanent dwelling place, rather than a temporary stopping place, would be in view. Luther&#8217;s translation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#959;&#957;&#945;&#943;</font> by <i>Wohnungen</i> is very accurate here, as it has the connotation of a permanent residence.</p>
