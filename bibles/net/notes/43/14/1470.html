<A NAME="1470"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">70</span><note=1486><b>sn</b> Jesus tells the disciples that he has told them all these things before they happen, so that when they do happen the disciples <i>may believe</i>. This does not mean they had not believed prior to this time; over and over the author has affirmed that they have (cf. 2:11). But when they see these things happen, their level of trust in Jesus will increase and their concept of who he is will expand. The confession of Thomas in 20:28 is representative of this increased understanding of who Jesus is. Cf. John 13:19.</p>
