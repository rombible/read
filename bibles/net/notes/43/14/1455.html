<A NAME="1455"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=1471><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;we will come to him and will make our dwelling place with him.&#8221; The context here is individual rather than corporate indwelling, so the masculine singular pronoun has been retained throughout v. 23. It is important to note, however, that the pronoun is used generically here and refers equally to men, women, and children.</p>
