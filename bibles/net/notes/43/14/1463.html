<A NAME="1463"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=1479><b>sn</b> <i>Peace I leave with you. </i>In spite of appearances, this verse does not introduce a new subject (peace). Jesus will use the phrase as a greeting to his disciples after his resurrection (20:19, 21, 26). It is here a reflection of the Hebrew <i>shalom </i>as a farewell. But Jesus says he leaves <i>peace</i> with his disciples. This should probably be understood ultimately in terms of the indwelling of the Paraclete, the Holy Spirit, who has been the topic of the preceding verses. It is his presence, after Jesus has left the disciples and finally returned to the Father, which will remain with them and comfort them. </p>
