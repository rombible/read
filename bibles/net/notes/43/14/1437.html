<A NAME="1437"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">37</span><note=1453><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Helper&#8221; or &#8220;Counselor&#8221;; <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Paraclete,&#8221; from the Greek word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#940;&#954;&#955;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">paraklhto&quot;</font>). Finding an appropriate English translation for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#940;&#954;&#955;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#962;</font> is a very difficult task. No single English word has exactly the same range of meaning as the Greek word. &#8220;Comforter,&#8221; used by some of the older English versions, appears to be as old as Wycliffe. But today it suggests a quilt or a sympathetic mourner at a funeral. &#8220;Counselor&#8221; is adequate, but too broad, in contexts like &#8220;marriage counselor&#8221; or &#8220;camp counselor.&#8221; &#8220;Helper&#8221; or &#8220;Assistant&#8221; could also be used, but could suggest a subordinate rank. &#8220;Advocate,&#8221; the word chosen for this translation, has more forensic overtones than the Greek word does, although in John 16:5-11 a forensic context is certainly present. Because an &#8220;advocate&#8221; is someone who &#8220;advocates&#8221; or supports a position or viewpoint and since this is what the Paraclete will do for the preaching of the disciples, it was selected in spite of the drawbacks.</p>
