<A NAME="1420"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1436><b>tn</b> The mutual interrelationship of the Father and the Son (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#947;&#8060; &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#8183; &#960;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#8054; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#8001; &#960;&#945;&#964;&#8052;&#961; &#7952;&#957; &#7952;&#956;&#959;&#943; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">egw en tw patri kai Jo pathr en emoi estin</font>) is something that Jesus expected even his opponents to recognize (cf. John 10:38). The question Jesus asks of Philip (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8016; &#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#949;&#953;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">ou pisteuei&quot;</font>) expects the answer &#8220;yes.&#8221; Note that the following statement is addressed to all the disciples, however, because the plural pronoun (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8017;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Jumin</font>) is used. Jesus says that his teaching (the words he spoke to them all) did not originate from himself, but the Father, who permanently remains (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#941;&#957;&#969;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">menwn</font>) in relationship with Jesus, performs his works. One would have expected &#8220;speaks his words&#8221; here rather than &#8220;performs his works&#8221;; many of the church fathers (e.g., Augustine and Chrysostom) identified the two by saying that Jesus&#8217; words were works. But there is an implicit contrast in the next verse between words and works, and v. 12 seems to demand that the works are real works, not just words. It is probably best to see the two terms as related but not identical; there is a progression in the idea here. Both Jesus&#8217; words (recall the Samaritans&#8217; response in John 4:42) and Jesus&#8217; works are revelatory of who he is, but as the next verse indicates, works have greater confirmatory power than words.</p>
