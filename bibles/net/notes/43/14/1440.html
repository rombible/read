<A NAME="1440"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1456><b>tc</b> Some early and important witnesses (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>66*</sup> B D* W 1 565 it) have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">estin</font>, &#8220;he is&#8221;) instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">estai</font>, &#8220;he will be&#8221;) here, while other weighty witnesses ({<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>66c,75vid </sup><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A D<sup>1</sup> L <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920; &#936; </font><font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13 </sup>33<sup>vid</sup> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> as well as several versions and fathers}), read the future tense. When one considers transcriptional evidence, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;</font> is the more difficult reading and better explains the rise of the future tense reading, but it must be noted that both <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>66</sup> and D were corrected from the present tense to the future. If <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;</font> were the original reading, one would expect a few manuscripts to be corrected to read the present when they originally read the future, but that is not the case. When one considers what the author would have written, the future is on much stronger ground. The immediate context (both in 14:16 and in the chapter as a whole) points to the future, and the theology of the book regards the advent of the Spirit as a decidedly future event (see, e.g., 7:39 and 16:7). The present tense could have arisen from an error of sight on the part of some scribes or more likely from an error of thought as scribes reflected upon the present role of the Spirit. Although a decision is difficult, the future tense is most likely authentic. For further discussion on this textual problem, see James M. Hamilton, Jr., &#8220;He Is with You and He Will Be in You&#8221; (Ph.D. diss., The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, 2003), 213-20.</p>
