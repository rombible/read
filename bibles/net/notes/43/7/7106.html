<A NAME="7106"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">106</span><note=677><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;for the Spirit was not yet.&#8221; Although only B and a handful of other NT <sc>mss supply the participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#949;&#948;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">dedomenon</font>), this is followed in the translation to avoid misunderstanding by the modern English reader that prior to this time the Spirit did not exist. John&#8217;s phrase is expressed from a human standpoint and has nothing to do with the preexistence of the third Person of the Godhead. The meaning is that the era of the Holy Spirit had not yet arrived; the Spirit was not as yet at work in a way he later would be because Jesus had not yet returned to his Father. Cf. also Acts 19:2.</p>
