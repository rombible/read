<A NAME="718"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=589><b>sn</b> One always speaks of &#8220;going <i>up</i>&#8221; to Jerusalem in Jewish idiom, even though in western thought it is more common to speak of south as &#8220;down&#8221; (Jerusalem lies south of Galilee). The reason for the idiom is that Jerusalem was identified with Mount Zion in the OT, so that altitude was the issue.</p>
