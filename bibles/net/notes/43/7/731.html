<A NAME="731"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=602><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;started teaching.&#8221; An ingressive sense for the imperfect verb (&#8220;began to teach&#8221; or &#8220;started teaching&#8221;) fits well here, since the context implies that Jesus did not start his teaching at the beginning of the festival, but began when it was about half over.</p>
