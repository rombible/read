<A NAME="789"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">89</span><note=660><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;servants.&#8221; The &#8220;chief priests and Pharisees&#8221; is a comprehensive term for the groups represented in the ruling council (the Sanhedrin) as in John 7:45; 18:3; Acts 5:22, 26. As &#8220;servants&#8221; or &#8220;officers&#8221; of the Sanhedrin their representatives should be distinguished from the Levites serving as temple police (perhaps John 7:30 and 44; also John 8:20; 10:39; 19:6; Acts 4:3). Even when performing &#8220;police&#8221; duties such as here, their &#8220;officers&#8221; are doing so only as part of their general tasks (see K. H. Rengstorf, <i>TDNT</i> 8:540).</p>
