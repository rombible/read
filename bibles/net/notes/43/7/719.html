Those with the reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8016;&#954;</font> are not as impressive (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> D K 1241 <i>al </i>lat), but <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8016;&#954;</font> is the more difficult reading here, especially because it stands in tension with v. 10. On the one hand, it is possible that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8016;&#954;</font> arose because of homoioarcton: A copyist who saw <font face="Greek Uncials">oupw</font> wrote <font face="Greek Uncials">ouk</font>. However, it is more likely that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8020;&#960;&#969;</font> was introduced early on to harmonize with what is said two verses later. As for Jesus&#8217; refusal to go up to the feast in v. 8, the statement does not preclude action of a different kind at a later point. Jesus may simply have been refusing to accompany his brothers with the rest of the group of pilgrims, preferring to travel separately and &#8220;in secret&#8221; (v. 10) with his disciples.</p>
