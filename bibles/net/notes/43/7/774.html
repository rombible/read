<A NAME="774"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">74</span><note=645><b>sn</b> <i>You both know me and know where I come from! </i>Jesus&#8217; response while teaching in the temple is difficult &#8211; it appears to concede too much understanding to his opponents. It is best to take the words as irony: &#8220;So you know me and know where I am from, do you?&#8221; On the physical, literal level, they did know where he was from: Nazareth of Galilee (at least they thought they knew). But on another deeper (spiritual) level, they did not: He came from heaven, from the Father. Jesus insisted that he has not come on his own initiative (cf. 5:37), but at the bidding of the Father who sent him.</p>
