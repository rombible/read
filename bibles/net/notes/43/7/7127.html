<A NAME="7127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">127</span><note=698><b>sn</b> The <i>chief priests and Pharisees</i> (John 7:45) is a comprehensive term for the groups represented in the ruling council (the Sanhedrin) as in John 7:45; 18:3; Acts 5:22, 26. Likewise the term <i>ruler</i> here denotes a member of the Sanhedrin, the highest legal, legislative, and judicial body among the Jews. Note the same word (&#8220;ruler&#8221;) is used to describe Nicodemus in John 3:1, and Nicodemus also speaks up in this episode (John 7:50).</p>
