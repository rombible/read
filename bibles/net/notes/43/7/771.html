<A NAME="771"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=642><b>sn</b> The view of these people regarding the Messiah that <i>no one will know where he comes from</i> reflects the idea that the origin of the Messiah is a mystery. In the Talmud (<i>b. Sanhedrin</i> 97a) Rabbi Zera taught: &#8220;Three come unawares: Messiah, a found article, and a scorpion.&#8221; Apparently OT prophetic passages like Mal 3:1 and Dan 9:25 were interpreted by some as indicating a sudden appearance of Messiah. It appears that this was not a universal view: The scribes summoned by Herod at the coming of the Magi in Matt 2 knew that the Messiah was to be born in Bethlehem. It is important to remember that Jewish messianic expectations in the early 1st century were not monolithic.</p>
