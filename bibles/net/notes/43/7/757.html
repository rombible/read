<A NAME="757"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">57</span><note=628><b>sn</b> <i>If a male child is circumcised on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses is not broken. </i>The Rabbis counted 248 parts to a man&#8217;s body. In the Talmud (<i>b. Yoma</i> 85b) R. Eleazar ben Azariah (ca. <sc>a.d. 100) states: &#8220;If circumcision, which attaches to one only of the 248 members of the human body, suspends the Sabbath, how much more shall the saving of the whole body suspend the Sabbath?&#8221; So absolutely binding did rabbinic Judaism regard the command of Lev 12:3 to circumcise on the eighth day, that in the Mishnah <i>m. Shabbat </i>18.3; 19.1, 2; and <i>m. Nedarim</i> 3.11 all hold that the command to circumcise overrides the command to observe the Sabbath.</p>
