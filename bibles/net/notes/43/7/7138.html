<A NAME="7138"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">138</span><note=709><b>tc</b> At least one early and important ms (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>66*</sup>) places the article before &#8220;prophet&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#8053;&#964;&#951;&#962;</font>,<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> </font><font face="Greektl">Jo profhths</font>), making this a reference to the &#8220;prophet like Moses&#8221; mentioned in Deut 18:15.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> This claim by the leaders presents some difficulty, because Jonah had been from Gath Hepher, in Galilee (2 Kgs 14:25). Also the Babylonian Talmud later stated, &#8220;There was not a tribe in Israel from which there did not come prophets&#8221; (<i>b.</i> <i>Sukkah</i> 27b). Two explanations are possible: (1) In the heat of anger the members of the Sanhedrin overlooked the facts (this is perhaps the easiest explanation). (2) This anarthrous noun is to be understood as a reference to <i>the</i> prophet of Deut 18:15 (note the reading of <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>66</sup> which is articular), by this time an eschatological figure in popular belief. This would produce in the text of John&#8217;s Gospel a high sense of irony indeed, since the religious authorities by their insistence that &#8220;the Prophet&#8221; could not come from Galilee displayed their true ignorance of where Jesus came from on <i>two</i> levels at once (Bethlehem, his birthplace, the fulfillment of Mic 5:2, but also heaven, from which he was sent by the Father). The author does not even bother to refute the false attestation of Jesus&#8217; place of birth as Galilee (presumably Christians knew all too well where Jesus came from).</p>
