<A NAME="710"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=581><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;your deeds that you are doing.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Should the advice by Jesus&#8217; brothers, <i>Leave here and go to Judea so your disciples may see your miracles that you are performing</i>, be understood as a suggestion that he should attempt to win back the disciples who had deserted him earlier (6:66)? Perhaps. But it is also possible to take the words as indicating that if Jesus is going to put forward messianic claims (i.e., through miraculous signs) then he should do so in Jerusalem, not in the remote parts of Galilee. Such an understanding seems to fit better with the following verse. It would also indicate misunderstanding on the part of Jesus&#8217; brothers of the true nature of his mission &#8211; he did not come as the royal Messiah of Jewish apocalyptic expectation, to be enthroned as king at this time.</p>
