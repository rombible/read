<A NAME="78"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=579><b>sn</b> Since the present verse places these incidents at the <i>feast of Tabernacles</i> (<sc>a.d. 29 or 32, depending on whether one dates the crucifixion in <sc>a.d. 30 or 33) there would have been a 6-month interval during which no events are recorded. The author is obviously selective in his approach; he is not recording an exhaustive history (as he will later tell the reader in John 21:25). After healing the paralytic on the Sabbath in Jerusalem (John 5:1-47), Jesus withdrew again to Galilee because of mounting opposition. In Galilee the feeding of the 5,000 took place, which marked the end of the Galilean ministry for all practical purposes. John 7:1-9 thus marks Jesus&#8217; final departure from Galilee.</p>
