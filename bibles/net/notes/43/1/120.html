<a name="120"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=20><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;He was the true light, who gives light to everyone who comes into the world.&#8221; The participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#961;&#967;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ercomenon</font>) may be either (1) neuter nominative, agreeing with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8056; &#966;&#8182;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">to fw&quot;</font>), or (2) masculine accusative, agreeing with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anqrwpon</font>). Option (1) results in a periphrastic imperfect with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7974;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">hn</font>), <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7974;&#957; &#964;&#8056; &#966;&#8182;&#962;&#8230; &#7952;&#961;&#967;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957;</font>, referring to the incarnation. Option (2) would have the participle modifying <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#957;</font> and referring to the true light as enlightening &#8220;every man who comes into the world.&#8221; Option (2) has some rabbinic parallels: The phrase &#8220;all who come into the world&#8221; is a fairly common expression for &#8220;every man&#8221; (cf. <i>Leviticus</i> <i>Rabbah</i> 31.6). But (1) must be preferred here, because: (a) In the next verse the light is in the world; it is logical for v. 9 to speak of its entering the world; (b) in other passages Jesus is described as &#8220;coming into the world&#8221; (6:14, 9:39, 11:27, 16:28) and in 12:46 Jesus says: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#947;&#8060; &#966;&#8182;&#962; &#949;&#7984;&#962; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#954;&#972;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#957; &#7952;&#955;&#8053;&#955;&#965;&#952;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">egw fw&quot; ei&quot; ton kosmon elhluqa</font>); (c) use of a periphrastic participle with the imperfect tense is typical Johannine style: 1:28, 2:6, 3:23, 10:40, 11:1, 13:23, 18:18 and 25. In every one of these except 13:23 the finite verb is first and separated by one or more intervening words from the participle.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> In v. 9 the <i>world</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#972;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">kosmos</font>) is mentioned for the first time. This is another important theme word for John. Generally, <i>the world</i> as a Johannine concept does not refer to the totality of creation (the universe), although there are exceptions at 11:9. 17:5, 24, 21:25, but to the world of human beings and human affairs. Even in 1:10 the world created through the <i>Logos</i> is a world capable of knowing (or reprehensibly not knowing) its Creator. Sometimes <i>the world</i> is further qualified as <i>this world</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#954;&#972;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#962; &#959;&#8023;&#964;&#959;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Jo kosmos Joutos</font>) as in 8:23, 9:39, 11:9, 12:25, 31; 13:1, 16:11, 18:36. This is not merely equivalent to the rabbinic phrase &#8220;this present age&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#945;&#7984;&#8061;&#957; &#959;&#8023;&#964;&#959;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Jo aiwn Joutos</font>) and contrasted with &#8220;the world to come.&#8221; For John it is also contrasted to a world other than this one, already existing; this is the lower world, corresponding to which there is a world above (see especially 8:23, 18:36). Jesus appears not only as the Messiah by means of whom an eschatological future is anticipated (as in the synoptic gospels) but also as an envoy from the heavenly world to <i>this world</i>.</p>
