<a name="111"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=11><b>sn</b> The author now introduces what will become a major theme of John&#8217;s Gospel: the opposition of <i>light</i> and <i>darkness</i>. The antithesis is a natural one, widespread in antiquity. Gen 1 gives considerable emphasis to it in the account of the creation, and so do the writings of Qumran. It is the major theme of one of the most important extra-biblical documents found at Qumran, the so-called War Scroll, properly titled <i>The War of the Sons of Light with the Sons of Darkness</i>. Connections between John and Qumran are still an area of scholarly debate and a consensus has not yet emerged. See T. A. Hoffman, &#8220;1 John and the Qumran Scrolls,&#8221; <i>BTB </i>8 (1978): 117-25.</p>
