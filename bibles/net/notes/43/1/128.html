<a name="128"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=28><b>tn</b> On the use of the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#969;</font> + <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pisteuw</font> + <font face="Greektl">ei&quot;</font>) construction in John: The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#969;</font> occurs 98 times in John (compared to 11 times in Matthew, 14 times in Mark [including the longer ending], and 9 times in Luke). One of the unsolved mysteries is why the corresponding noun form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pistis</font>) is never used at all. Many have held the noun was in use in some pre-Gnostic sects and this rendered it suspect for John. It might also be that for John, faith was an activity, something that men do (cf. W. Turner, &#8220;Believing and Everlasting Life &#8211; A Johannine Inquiry,&#8221; <i>ExpTim </i>64 [1952/53]: 50-52). John uses <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#969;</font> in 4 major ways: (1) of believing facts, reports, etc., 12 times; (2) of believing people (or the scriptures), 19 times; (3) of believing &#8220;in&#8221; Christ&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#969;</font> + <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#962;</font> + acc.), 36 times; (4) used absolutely without any person or object specified, 30 times (the one remaining passage is 2:24, where Jesus refused to &#8220;trust&#8221; himself to certain individuals). Of these, the most significant is the use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#969;</font> with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#962;</font> + accusative. It is not unlike the Pauline <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8183;</font> (<font face="Greektl">en Cristw</font>) formula. Some have argued that this points to a Hebrew (more likely Aramaic) original behind the Fourth Gospel. But it probably indicates something else, as C. H. Dodd observed: &#8220;<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#949;&#953;&#957;</font> with the dative so inevitably connoted simple credence, in the sense of an intellectual judgment, that the moral element of personal trust or reliance inherent in the Hebrew or Aramaic phrase &#8211; an element integral to the primitive Christian conception of faith in Christ &#8211; needed to be otherwise expressed&#8221; (<i>The Interpretation of the Fourth Gospel</i>, 183).</p>
