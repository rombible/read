<a name="113"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=13><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;comprehended it,&#8221; or &#8220;overcome it.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#941;&#955;&#945;&#946;&#949;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">katelaben</font>) is not easy to translate. &#8220;To seize&#8221; or &#8220;to grasp&#8221; is possible, but this also permits &#8220;to grasp with the mind&#8221; in the sense of &#8220;to comprehend&#8221; (esp. in the middle voice). This is probably another Johannine double meaning &#8211; one does not usually think of darkness as trying to &#8220;understand&#8221; light. For it to mean this, &#8220;darkness&#8221; must be understood as meaning &#8220;certain people,&#8221; or perhaps &#8220;humanity&#8221; at large, darkened in understanding. But in John&#8217;s usage, darkness is not normally used of people or a group of people. Rather it usually signifies the evil environment or &#8216;sphere&#8217; in which people find themselves: &#8220;They loved darkness rather than light&#8221; (John 3:19). Those who follow Jesus do not walk in darkness (8:12). They are to walk while they have light, lest the darkness &#8220;overtake/overcome&#8221; them (12:35, same verb as here). For John, with his set of symbols and imagery, darkness is not something which seeks to &#8220;understand (comprehend)&#8221; the light, but represents the forces of evil which seek to &#8220;overcome (conquer)&#8221; it. The English verb &#8220;to master&#8221; may be used in both sorts of contexts, as &#8220;he mastered his lesson&#8221; and &#8220;he mastered his opponent.&#8221;</p>
