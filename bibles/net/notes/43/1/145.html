Only one letter would have differentiated the readings in the <span class="smallcaps">mss</span>, since both words would have been contracted as <i>nomina sacra</i>: thus <font face="Greek Uncials">qMs</font> or <font face="Greek Uncials">uMs</font>. Externally, there are several variants, but they can be grouped essentially by whether they read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font> or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#965;&#7985;&#972;&#962;</font>. The majority of <span class="smallcaps">mss</span>, especially the later ones (A C<sup>3 </sup><font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13 </sup><font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat), read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#956;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#8052;&#962; &#965;&#7985;&#972;&#962;</font>. <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>75</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>1</sup> 33 <i>pc</i> have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#956;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#8052;&#962; &#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font>, while the anarthrous <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#8052;&#962; &#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font> is found in <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>66</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* B C* L <i>pc</i>. The articular <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font> is almost certainly a scribal emendation to the anarthrous <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font>, for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font> without the article is a much harder reading. The external evidence thus strongly supports <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#8052;&#962; &#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font>. Internally, although <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#965;&#7985;&#972;&#962;</font> fits the immediate context more readily, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font> is much more difficult. As well, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font> also explains the origin of the other reading (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#965;&#7985;&#972;&#962;</font>), because it is difficult to see why a scribe who found <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#965;&#7985;&#972;&#962;</font> in the text he was copying would alter it to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font>. Scribes would naturally change the wording to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#965;&#7985;&#972;&#962;</font> however, since <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#8052;&#962; &#965;&#7985;&#972;&#962;</font> is a uniquely Johannine christological title (cf. John 3:16, 18; 1 John 4:9). But <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font> as the older and more difficult reading is preferred. As for translation, it makes the most sense to see the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font> as in apposition to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#8053;&#962;</font>, and the participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#8036;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jo wn</font>) as in apposition to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font>, giving in effect three descriptions of Jesus rather than only two. (B. D. Ehrman, <i>The Orthodox Corruption of Scripture</i>, 81, suggests that it is nearly impossible and completely unattested in the NT for an adjective followed immediately by a noun that agrees in gender, number, and case, to be a substantival adjective: &#8220;when is an adjective <i>ever</i> used substantivally when it immediately precedes a noun of the same inflection?&#8221; This, however, is an overstatement. First, as Ehrman admits, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#8053;&#962;</font> in John 1:14 is substantival. And since it is an established usage for the adjective in this context, one might well expect that the author would continue to use the adjective substantivally four verses later. Indeed, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#8053;&#962;</font> is already moving toward a crystallized substantival adjective in the NT [cf. Luke 9:38; Heb 11:17]; in patristic Greek, the process continued [cf. <i>PGL</i> 881 s.v. 7]. Second, there are several instances in the NT in which a <i>substantival</i> adjective is followed by a noun with which it has complete concord: cf., e.g., Rom 1:30; Gal 3:9; 1 Tim 1:9; 2 Pet 2:5.) The modern translations which best express this are the NEB (margin) and TEV. Several things should be noted: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#8053;&#962;</font> alone, without <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#965;&#7985;&#972;&#962;</font>, can mean &#8220;only son,&#8221; &#8220;unique son,&#8221; &#8220;unique one,&#8221; etc. (see 1:14). Furthermore, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font> is anarthrous. As such it carries qualitative force much like it does in 1:1c, where <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#8056;&#962; &#7974;&#957; &#8001; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">qeo&quot; hn Jo logo&quot;</font>) means &#8220;the Word was fully God&#8221; or &#8220;the Word was fully of the essence of deity.&#8221; Finally, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#8036;&#957;</font> occurs in Rev 1:4, 8; 4:8, 11:17; and 16:5, but even more significantly in the LXX of Exod 3:14. Putting all of this together leads to the translation given in the text.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;The unique one.&#8221; For the meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#8053;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">monogenh&quot;</font>) see the note on &#8220;one and only&#8221; in 1:14. </p>
