<a name="1120"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">120</span><note=120><b>sn</b> Many have speculated about what Nathanael was doing under the <i>fig tree</i>. Meditating on the Messiah who was to come? A good possibility, since the fig tree was used as shade for teaching or studying by the later rabbis (<i>Ecclesiastes Rabbah</i> 5:11). Also, the fig tree was symbolic for messianic peace and plenty (Mic 4:4, Zech 3:10.)</p>
