There is no clear evidence that they did so in the 1st century, however &#8211; but Luke 3:15 indicates some wondered. Concerning the <i>Christ</i>, the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#967;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">cristos</font>) was originally an adjective (&#8220;anointed&#8221;), developing in LXX into a substantive (&#8220;an anointed one&#8221;), then developing still further into a technical generic term (&#8220;the anointed one&#8221;). In the intertestamental period it developed further into a technical term referring to the hoped-for anointed one, that is, a specific individual. In the NT the development starts there (technical-specific), is so used in the gospels, and then develops in Paul to mean virtually Jesus&#8217; last name.</p>
