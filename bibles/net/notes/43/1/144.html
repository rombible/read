John 1:17 seems to indicate clearly that the Old Covenant (Sinai) was being contrasted with the New. In Jewish sources the Law was regarded as a gift from God (Josephus, <i>Ant.</i> 3.8.10 [3.223]; <i>Pirqe Avot</i> 1.1; <i>Sifre</i> Deut 31:4 §305). Further information can be found in T. F. Glasson, <i>Moses in the Fourth Gospel</i> (SBT).</p>
