<a name="1100"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">100</span><note=100><b>sn</b> Naturally part of Andrew&#8217;s concept of the <i>Messiah</i> would have been learned from John the Baptist (v. 40). However, there were a number of different messianic expectations in 1st century Palestine (see the note on <i>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; </i>in v. 19), and it would be wrong to assume that what Andrew meant here is the same thing the author means in the purpose statement at the end of the Fourth Gospel, 20:31. The issue here is not whether the disciples&#8217; initial faith in Jesus as Messiah was genuine or not, but whether their concept of who Jesus was grew and developed progressively as they spent time following him, until finally after his resurrection it is affirmed in the climactic statement of John&#8217;s Gospel, the affirmation of Thomas in 20:28. </p>
