<a name="184"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">84</span><note=84><b>sn</b> John says the Spirit <i>remained on</i> Jesus. The Greek verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#941;&#957;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">menw</font>) is a favorite Johannine word, used 40 times in the Gospel and 27 times in the Epistles (67 together) against 118 times total in the NT. The general significance of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#941;&#957;&#969;</font> for John is to express the permanency of relationship between Father and Son and Son and believer. Here the use of the word implies that Jesus permanently possesses the Holy Spirit, and because he does, he will dispense the Holy Spirit to others in baptism. Other notes on the dispensation of the Spirit occur at John 3:5 and following (at least implied by the wordplay), John 3:34, 7:38-39, numerous passages in John 14-16 (the Paraclete passages) and John 20:22. Note also the allusion to Isa 42:1 &#8211; &#8220;Behold my servant&#8230;my chosen one in whom my soul delights. I have put my Spirit on him.&#8221;</p>
