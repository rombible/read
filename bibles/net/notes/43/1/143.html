The most commonly held view is (2) in one sense or another, and this is probably the best explanation. This sense is supported by a fairly well-known use in Philo, <i>Posterity </i>43 (145). Morna D. Hooker suggested that Exod 33:13 provides the background for this expression: &#8220;Now therefore, I pray you, if I have found <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#967;&#940;&#961;&#953;&#962;</font> (LXX) in your sight, let me know your ways, that I may know you, so that I may find <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#967;&#940;&#961;&#953;&#962;</font> (LXX) in your sight.&#8221; Hooker proposed that it is this idea of favor given to one who has already received favor which lies behind 1:16, and this seems very probable as a good explanation of the meaning of the phrase (&#8220;The Johannine Prologue and the Messianic Secret,&#8221; <i>NTS </i>21 [1974/75]: 53).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Earlier commentators (including Origen and Luther) took the words <i>For we have all received from his fullness one gracious gift after another</i> to be John the Baptist&#8217;s. Most modern commentators take them as the words of the author.</p>
