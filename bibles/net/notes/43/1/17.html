<a name="17"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=7><b>tc</b> There is a major punctuation problem here: Should this relative clause go with v. 3 or v. 4? The earliest <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> have no punctuation (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>66,75*</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* A B <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#916;</font> <i>al</i>). Many of the later <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> which do have punctuation place it before the phrase, thus putting it with v. 4 (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>75c</sup> C D L W<sup>s</sup> 050* <i>pc</i>). NA<sup>25</sup> placed the phrase in v. 3; NA<sup>26</sup> moved the words to the beginning of v. 4. In a detailed article K. Aland defended the change (&#8220;Eine Untersuchung zu Johannes 1, 3-4. Über die Bedeutung eines Punktes,&#8221; <i>ZNW </i>59 [1968]: 174-209). He sought to prove that the attribution of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8003; &#947;&#941;&#947;&#959;&#957;&#949;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">}o gegonen</font>) to v. 3 began to be carried out in the 4th century in the Greek church. This came out of the Arian controversy, and was intended as a safeguard for doctrine. The change was unknown in the West. Aland is probably correct in affirming that the phrase was attached to v. 4 by the Gnostics and the Eastern Church; only when the Arians began to use the phrase was it attached to v. 3. But this does not rule out the possibility that, by moving the words from v. 4 to v. 3, one is restoring the original reading. Understanding the words as part of v. 3 is natural and adds to the emphasis which is built up there, while it also gives a terse, forceful statement in v. 4. On the other hand, taking the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8003; &#947;&#941;&#947;&#959;&#957;&#949;&#957;</font> with v. 4 gives a complicated expression: C. K. Barrett says that both ways of understanding v. 4 with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8003; &#947;&#941;&#947;&#959;&#957;&#949;&#957;</font> included &#8220;are almost impossibly clumsy&#8221; (<i>St. John</i>, 157): &#8220;That which came into being &#8211; in it the Word was life&#8221;; &#8220;That which came into being &#8211; in the Word was its life.&#8221; The following stylistic points should be noted in the solution of this problem: (1) John frequently starts sentences with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">en</font>); (2) he repeats frequently (&#8220;nothing was created that has been created&#8221;); (3) 5:26 and 6:53 both give a sense similar to v. 4 if it is understood without the phrase; (4) it makes far better Johannine sense to say that in the Word was life than to say that the created universe (what was made, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8003; &#947;&#941;&#947;&#959;&#957;&#949;&#957;</font>) was life in him. In conclusion, the phrase is best taken with v. 3. Schnackenburg, Barrett, Carson, Haenchen, Morris, KJV, and NIV concur (against Brown, Beasley-Murray, and NEB). The arguments of R. Schnackenburg, <i>St. John</i>, 1:239-40, are particularly persuasive.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;made&#8221;; <i>Grk</i> &#8220;that has come into existence.&#8221; </p>
