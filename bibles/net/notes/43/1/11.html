It was attended by the related question of &#8220;What is the process by which the secondary things came out of the primary one (or ones)?,&#8221; or in Aristotelian terminology, &#8220;What is the &#8216;beginning&#8217; (same Greek word as <i>beginning</i>, John 1:1) and what is the origin of the things that are made?&#8221; In the New Testament the word usually has a temporal sense, but even BDAG 138 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8053;</font> 3 lists a major category of meaning as &#8220;the first cause.&#8221; For John, the words &#8220;In the beginning&#8221; are most likely a conscious allusion to the opening words of Genesis &#8211; &#8220;In the beginning.&#8221; Other concepts which occur prominently in Gen 1 are also found in John&#8217;s prologue: &#8220;life&#8221; (1:4) &#8220;light&#8221; (1:4) and &#8220;darkness&#8221; (1:5). Gen 1 describes the first (physical) creation; John 1 describes the new (spiritual) creation. But this is not to play off a false dichotomy between &#8220;physical&#8221; and &#8220;spiritual&#8221;; the first creation was both physical and spiritual. The new creation is really a re-creation, of the spiritual (first) but also the physical. (In spite of the common understanding of John&#8217;s &#8220;spiritual&#8221; emphasis, the &#8220;physical&#8221; re-creation should not be overlooked; this occurs in John 2 with the changing of water into wine, in John 11 with the resurrection of Lazarus, and the emphasis of John 20-21 on the aftermath of Jesus&#8217; own resurrection.)</p>
