<a name="1111"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">111</span><note=111><b>sn</b> <i>Nathanael</i> is traditionally identified with Bartholomew (although John never describes him as such). He appears here after <i>Philip</i>, while in all lists of the twelve except in Acts 1:13, Bartholomew follows Philip. Also, the Aramaic <i>Bar-tolmai</i> means &#8220;son of Tolmai,&#8221; the surname; the man almost certainly had another name.</p>
