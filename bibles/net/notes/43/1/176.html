In Jewish thought this was held to be a supremely important sacrifice. G. Vermès stated: &#8220;For the Palestinian Jew, all lamb sacrifice, and especially the Passover lamb and the Tamid offering, was a memorial of the Akedah with its effects of deliverance, forgiveness of sin and messianic salvation&#8221; (<i>Scripture and Tradition in Judaism</i> [StPB], 225).</p>
