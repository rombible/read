<a name="1122"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">122</span><note=122><b>sn</b> Nathanael&#8217;s confession &#8211; <i>You are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel</i> &#8211; is best understood as a confession of Jesus&#8217; messiahship. It has strong allusions to Ps 2:6-7, a well-known messianic psalm. What Nathanael&#8217;s exact understanding was at this point is hard to determine, but &#8220;son of God&#8221; was a designation for the Davidic king in the OT, and Nathanael parallels it with <i>King of Israel</i> here.</p>
