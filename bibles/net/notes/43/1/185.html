<a name="185"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">85</span><note=85><b>tc</b> &#8225; What did John the Baptist declare about Jesus on this occasion? Did he say, &#8220;This is the Son of God&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8023;&#964;&#972;&#962; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; &#8001; &#965;&#7985;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font>, <font face="Greektl">|outo&quot; estin Jo Juio&quot; tou qeou</font>), or &#8220;This is the Chosen One of God&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8023;&#964;&#972;&#962; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; &#8001; &#7952;&#954;&#955;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font>, <font face="Greektl">outo&quot; estin Jo eklekto&quot; tou qeou</font>)? The majority of the witnesses, impressive because of their diversity in age and locales, read &#8220;This is the Son of God&#8221; (so {<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>66,75</sup> A B C L <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920; &#936; </font>0233<sup>vid</sup> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13</sup> 33 1241 aur c f l g bo as well as the majority of Byzantine minuscules and many others}). Most scholars take this to be sufficient evidence to regard the issue as settled without much of a need to reflect on internal evidence. On the other hand, one of the earliest <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> for this verse, {<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>5</sup>} (3rd century), evidently read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8023;&#964;&#972;&#962; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; &#8001; &#7952;&#954;&#955;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font>. (There is a gap in the ms at the point of the disputed words; it is too large for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#965;&#7985;&#972;&#962;</font> especially if written, as it surely would have been, as a <i>nomen sacrum</i> [<font face="Greek Uncials">uMs</font>]. The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954;&#955;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font> was not a <i>nomen sacrum</i> and would have therefore taken up much more space [<font face="Greek Uncials">eklektos</font>]. Given these two variants, there is hardly any question as to what <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>5</sup> read.) This papyrus has many affinities with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>*, which here also has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#7952;&#954;&#955;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font>. In addition to their combined testimony <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>106vid</sup> b e ff<sup>2*</sup> sy<sup>s,c</sup> also support this reading. <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>106</sup> is particularly impressive, for it is a second third-century papyrus in support of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#7952;&#954;&#955;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font>. A third reading combines these two: &#8220;the elect Son&#8221; (<i>electus filius</i> in ff<sup>2c</sup> sa and a [with slight variation]). Although the evidence for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954;&#955;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font> is not as impressive as that for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#965;&#7985;&#972;&#962;</font>, the reading is found in early Alexandrian and Western witnesses. Turning to the internal evidence, &#8220;the Chosen One&#8221; clearly comes out ahead. &#8220;Son of God&#8221; is a favorite expression of the author (cf. 1:49; 3:18; 5:25; 10:36; 11:4, 27; 19:7; 20:31); further, there are several other references to &#8220;his Son,&#8221; &#8220;the Son,&#8221; etc. Scribes would be naturally motivated to change <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954;&#955;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font> to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#965;&#7985;&#972;&#962;</font> since the latter is both a Johannine expression and is, on the surface, richer theologically in 1:34. On the other hand, there is not a sufficient reason for scribes to change <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#965;&#7985;&#972;&#962;</font> to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954;&#955;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font>. The term never occurs in John; even its verbal cognate (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954;&#955;&#941;&#947;&#969;</font>, <font face="Greektl">eklegw</font>) is never affirmed of Jesus in this Gospel. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954;&#955;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font> clearly best explains the rise of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#965;&#7985;&#972;&#962;</font>. Further, the third reading (&#8220;Chosen Son of God&#8221;) is patently a conflation of the other two. It has all the earmarks of adding <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#965;&#7985;&#972;&#962;</font> to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954;&#955;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font>. Thus, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#965;&#7985;&#972;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font> is almost certainly a motivated reading. As R. E. Brown notes (<i>John </i>[AB], 1:57), &#8220;On the basis of theological tendency&#8230;it is difficult to imagine that Christian scribes would change &#8216;the Son of God&#8217; to &#8216;God&#8217;s chosen one,&#8217; while a change in the opposite direction would be quite plausible. Harmonization with the Synoptic accounts of the baptism (&#8216;You are [This is] my beloved <i>Son</i>&#8217;) would also explain the introduction of &#8216;the Son of God&#8217; into John; the same phenomenon occurs in vi 69. Despite the weaker textual evidence, therefore, it seems best &#8211; with Lagrange, Barrett, Boismard, and others &#8211; to accept &#8216;God&#8217;s chosen one&#8217; as original.&#8221; </p>
