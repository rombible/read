But the reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#914;&#951;&#952;&#945;&#957;&#943;&#8115;</font> is strongly supported by {<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>66,75</sup> A B C* L W<sup>s</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#916; &#920; &#936;</font>* 565 579 700 1241 1424 <i>pm</i> latt bo as well as several fathers}. Since there is no known Bethany &#8220;beyond the Jordan,&#8221; it is likely that the name would have been changed to a more etymologically edifying one (Origen mistakenly thought the name Bethabara meant &#8220;house of preparation&#8221; and for this reason was appropriate in this context; see <i>TCGNT</i> 171 for discussion). On the other hand, both since Origen&#8217;s understanding of the Semitic etymology of Bethabara was incorrect, and because Bethany was at least a well-known location in Palestine, mentioned in the Gospels about a dozen times, one has to wonder whether scribes replaced <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#914;&#951;&#952;&#945;&#946;&#945;&#961;&#8119; </font>with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#914;&#951;&#952;&#945;&#957;&#943;&#8115;</font>. However, if Origen&#8217;s understanding of the etymology of the name was representative, scribes may have altered the text in the direction of Bethabara. And even if most scribes were unfamiliar with what the name might signify, that a reading which did not contradict the Gospels&#8217; statements of a Bethany near Jerusalem was already at hand may have been sufficient reason for them to adopt Bethabara. Further, in light of the very strong testimony for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#914;&#951;&#952;&#945;&#957;&#943;&#8115;</font>, this reading should be regarded as authentic.</p>
