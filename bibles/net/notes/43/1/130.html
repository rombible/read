<a name="130"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=30><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;of blood(s).&#8221; The plural <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#7985;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jaimatwn</font>) has seemed a problem to many interpreters. At least some sources in antiquity imply that blood was thought of as being important in the development of the fetus during its time in the womb: thus Wis 7:1: &#8220;in the womb of a mother I was molded into flesh, within the period of 10 months, compacted with blood, from the seed of a man and the pleasure of marriage.&#8221; In John 1:13, the plural <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#7985;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957;</font> may imply the action of both parents. It may also refer to the &#8220;genetic&#8221; contribution of both parents, and so be equivalent to &#8220;human descent&#8221; (see BDAG 26 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#7991;&#956;&#945;</font> 1.a). E. C. Hoskyns thinks John could not have used the singular here because Christians are in fact &#8216;begotten&#8217; by the blood of Christ (<i>The Fourth Gospel</i>, 143), although the context would seem to make it clear that the blood in question is something other than the blood of Christ.</p>
