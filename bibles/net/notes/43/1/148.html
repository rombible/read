The unique One (John 1:14), the One who has taken on human form and nature by becoming incarnate (<i>became flesh</i>, 1:14), who is himself fully God (<i>the Word was God</i>, 1:1c) and is to be identified with the ever-living One of the Old Testament revelation (Exod 3:14), who is in intimate relationship with the Father, this One and no other has fully revealed what God is like. As Jesus said to Philip in John 14:9, &#8220;The one who has seen me has seen the Father.&#8221;</p>
