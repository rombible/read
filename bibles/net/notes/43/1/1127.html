<a name="1127"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">127</span><note=127><b>sn</b> The title <i>Son of Man</i> appears 13 times in John&#8217;s Gospel. It is associated especially with the themes of crucifixion (3:14; 8:28), revelation (6:27; 6:53), and eschatological authority (5:27; 9:35). The title as used in John&#8217;s Gospel has for its background the son of man figure who appears in Dan 7:13-14 and is granted universal regal authority. Thus for the author, the emphasis in this title is not on Jesus&#8217; humanity, but on his heavenly origin and divine authority.</p>
