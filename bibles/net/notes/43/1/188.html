<a name="188"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">88</span><note=88><b>sn</b> This section (1:35-51) is joined to the preceding by the literary expedient of repeating the Baptist&#8217;s testimony about Jesus being the <i>Lamb of God</i> (1:36, cf. 1:29). This repeated testimony (1:36) no longer has revelatory value in itself, since it has been given before; its purpose, instead, is to institute a chain reaction which will bring John the Baptist&#8217;s disciples to Jesus and make them Jesus&#8217; own disciples.</p>
