<a name="1109"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">109</span><note=109><b>sn</b> Although the author thought of the town as in Galilee (12:21), <i>Bethsaida</i> technically was in Gaulanitis (Philip the Tetrarch&#8217;s territory) across from Herod&#8217;s Galilee. There may have been two places called Bethsaida, or this may merely reflect popular imprecision &#8211; locally it was considered part of Galilee, even though it was just east of the Jordan river. This territory was heavily Gentile (which may explain why Andrew and Philip both have Gentile names).</p>
