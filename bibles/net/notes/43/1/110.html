<a name="110"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=10><b>tn</b> To this point the author has used past tenses (imperfects, aorists); now he switches to a present. The light continually shines (thus the translation, &#8220;shines on&#8221;). Even as the author writes, it is shining. The present here most likely has gnomic force (though it is possible to take it as a historical present); it expresses the timeless truth that the light of the world (cf. 8:12, 9:5, 12:46) never ceases to shine.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>The light shines on. </i>The question of whether John has in mind here the preincarnate Christ or the incarnate Christ is probably too specific. The incarnation is not really introduced until v. 9, but here the point is more general: It is of the very nature of <i>light</i>, that it <i>shines</i>.</p>
