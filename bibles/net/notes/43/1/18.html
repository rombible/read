The two uses in 1:4, if they do not refer to &#8220;eternal&#8221; life, would be the only exceptions. (Also 1 John uses <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#950;&#969;&#8053;</font> 13 times, always of &#8220;eternal&#8221; life.)</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> An allusion to Ps 36:9, which gives significant OT background: &#8220;For with you is the fountain of life; In your light we see light.&#8221; In later Judaism, Bar 4:2 expresses a similar idea. Life, especially eternal life, will become one of the major themes of John&#8217;s Gospel.</p>
