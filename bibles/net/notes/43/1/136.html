The author is suggesting that this glory can now be seen in Jesus (note the following verse).<i> </i>The verb used here may imply that the Shekinah glory that once was found in the tabernacle has taken up residence in the person of Jesus. Cf. also John 2:19-21. <i>The Word became flesh. </i>This verse constitutes the most concise statement of the incarnation in the New Testament. John 1:1 makes it clear that the <i>Logos</i> was fully God, but 1:14 makes it clear that he was also fully human. A Docetic interpretation is completely ruled out. Here for the first time the <i>Logos</i> of 1:1 is identified as Jesus of Nazareth &#8211; the two are one and the same. Thus this is the last time the word <i>logos</i> is used in the Fourth Gospel to refer to the second person of the Trinity. From here on it is Jesus of Nazareth who is the focus of John&#8217;s Gospel.</p>
