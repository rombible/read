<a name="127"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=27><b>sn</b> <i>His own people did not receive him. </i>There is a subtle irony here: When the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">logos</font>) came into the world, he came to his <i>own</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8048; &#7988;&#948;&#953;&#945;</font>, <font face="Greektl">ta idia</font>, literally &#8220;his own things&#8221;) and his own people (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#7985; &#7988;&#948;&#953;&#959;&#953;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Joi idioi</font>), who should have known and received him, but they did not. This time John does not say that &#8220;his own&#8221; did not know him, but that they <i>did not receive him</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#941;&#955;&#945;&#946;&#959;&#957;</font>, <font face="Greektl">parelabon</font>). The idea is one not of mere recognition, but of acceptance and welcome.</p>
