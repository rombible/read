<A NAME="41"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=255><b>tc</b> Several early and important witnesses, along with the majority of later ones (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>66c,75</sup> A B C L W<sup>s</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 083 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13</sup> 33 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> sa), have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#973;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kurio&quot;</font>, &#8220;Lord&#8221;) here instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Ihsou&quot;</font>, &#8220;Jesus&#8221;). As significant as this external support is, the internal evidence seems to be on the side of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</font>. &#8220;Jesus&#8221; is mentioned two more times in the first two verses of chapter four in a way that is stylistically awkward (so much so that the translation has substituted the pronoun for the first one; see <b>tn</b> note below). This seems to be sufficient reason to motivate scribes to change the wording to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#973;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#962;</font>. Further, the reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962; </font>is not without decent support, though admittedly not as strong as that for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#973;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>66*</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> </font>D <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920; </font>086 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1</sup> 565 1241 <i>al</i> lat bo). On the other hand, this Gospel speaks of Jesus as Lord in the evangelist&#8217;s narrative descriptions elsewhere only in 11:2; 20:18, 20; 21:12; and probably 6:23, preferring <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</font> most of the time. This fact could be used to argue that scribes, acquainted with John&#8217;s style, changed <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#973;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#962; </font>to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</font>. But the immediate context generally is weighed more heavily than an author&#8217;s style. It is possible that neither word was in the original text and scribes supplied what they thought most appropriate (see <i>TCGNT</i> 176). But without ms evidence to this effect coupled with the harder reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</font>, this conjecture must remain doubtful. All in all, it is best to regard <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</font> as the original reading here.</p>

<A NAME="46"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=260><b>sn</b> The author doesn&#8217;t tell why Jesus chose to <i>set out once more for Galilee</i>. Some have suggested that the Pharisees turned their attention to Jesus because John the Baptist had now been thrown into prison. But the text gives no hint of this. In any case, perhaps Jesus simply did not want to provoke a confrontation at this time (knowing that his &#8220;hour&#8221; had not yet come).</p>
<A NAME="47"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=261><b>sn</b> Travel <i>through</i> <i>Samaria</i> was not geographically necessary; the normal route for Jews ran up the east side of the Jordan River (Transjordan). Although some take the impersonal verb <i>had to</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#949;&#8150;</font>, <font face="Greektl">dei</font>) here to indicate logical necessity only, normally in John&#8217;s Gospel its use involves God&#8217;s will or plan (3:7, 3:14, 3:30, 4:4, 4:20, 4:24, 9:4, 10:16, 12:34, 20:9).</p>
<A NAME="48"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=262><b>sn</b> <i>Samaria. </i>The Samaritans were descendants of 2 groups: (1) The remnant of native Israelites who were not deported after the fall of the Northern Kingdom in 722 <sc>b.c.; (2) Foreign colonists brought in from Babylonia and Media by the Assyrian conquerors to settle the land with inhabitants who would be loyal to Assyria. There was theological opposition between the Samaritans and the Jews because the former refused to worship in Jerusalem. After the exile the Samaritans put obstacles in the way of the Jewish restoration of Jerusalem, and in the 2nd century <sc>b.c. the Samaritans helped the Syrians in their wars against the Jews. In 128 <sc>b.c. the Jewish high priest retaliated and burned the Samaritan temple on Mount Gerizim.</p>

This would make the time 6 a.m. rather than noon. That would fit in this passage but not in John 19:14 which places the time when Jesus is condemned to be crucified at &#8220;the sixth hour.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="414"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=268><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;a woman from Samaria.&#8221; According to BDAG 912 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#931;&#945;&#956;&#940;&#961;&#949;&#953;&#945;</font>, the prepositional phrase is to be translated as a simple attributive: &#8220;<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#965;&#957;&#8052; &#7952;&#954; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#931;&#945;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#949;&#943;&#945;&#962;</font> a Samaritan woman J 4:7.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="417"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=271><b>sn</b> This is a parenthetical note by the author, indicating why Jesus asked the woman for a drink (for presumably his disciples also took the water bucket with them).</p>

In one sense &#8220;Judean&#8221; would work very well in the translation here, since the contrast is between residents of the two geographical regions. However, since in the context of this chapter the discussion soon becomes a religious rather than a territorial one (cf. vv. 19-26), the translation &#8220;Jew&#8221; has been retained here and in v. 22.</p>

<A NAME="425"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=279><b>tn</b> This is a second class conditional sentence in Greek.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The word translated <i>living</i> is used in Greek of flowing water, which leads to the woman&#8217;s misunderstanding in the following verse.

It is possible that no explicit subject was in the original text and scribes added either <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969; &#947;&#965;&#957;&#8053;</font> or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#957;&#951;</font> to make the meaning clear. It is also possible that the archetype of <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>75 </sup><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> </font>B expunged the subject because it was not altogether necessary, with the scribe of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> </font>later adding the pronoun. However, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969; &#947;&#965;&#957;&#8053;</font> is not in doubt in any other introduction to the woman&#8217;s words in this chapter (cf. vv. 9, 15, 17, 19, 25), suggesting that intentional deletion was not the motive for the shorter reading in v. 11 (or else why would they delete the words <i>only</i> here?). Thus, the fact that virtually all witnesses (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>66 </sup><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>2</sup> A C D L W<sup>s</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920; &#936; </font>050 083 086 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13</sup> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font><font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> </font>latt sy<sup>c,p,h </sup>sa bo) have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969; &#947;&#965;&#957;&#8053;</font> here may suggest that it is a motivated reading, conforming this verse to the rest of the pericope. Although a decision is difficult, it is probably best to regard the shorter reading as authentic. NA<sup>27</sup> has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969; &#947;&#965;&#957;&#8053;</font> in brackets, indicating doubts as to their authenticity. For English stylistic reasons, the translation also includes &#8220;the woman&#8221; here.</p>

<A NAME="430"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=284><b>sn</b> <i>Where then do you get this living water? </i>The woman&#8217;s reply is an example of the &#8220;misunderstood statement,&#8221; a technique appearing frequently in John&#8217;s Gospel. Jesus was speaking of <i>living water</i> which was spiritual (ultimately a Johannine figure for the Holy Spirit, see John 7:38-39), but the woman thought he was speaking of flowing (fresh drinkable) water. Her misunderstanding gave Jesus the opportunity to explain what he really meant.</p>

This can sometimes be indicated by using a &#8220;tag&#8221; at the end. In this instance all of v. 12 is one question. It has been broken into two sentences for the sake of English style (instead of &#8220;for he&#8221; the Greek reads &#8220;who&#8221;).</p>

This is the only instance of its being applied to the action of water. However, in the LXX it is used to describe the &#8220;Spirit of God&#8221; as it falls on Samson and Saul. See Judg 14:6, 19; 15:14; 1 Kgdms 10:2, 10 LXX (= 1 Sam 10:6, 10 ET); and Isa 35:6 (note context).</p>

It is unlikely that scribes would have deliberately expunged the name of Jesus from the text here, especially since it aids the reader with the flow of the dialogue.

The major problem in these verses concerns the contradiction between the proverb stated by Jesus in v. 44 and the reception of the Galileans in v. 45. Origen solved the problem by referring <i>his own country</i> to Judea (which Jesus had just left) and not Galilee. But this runs counter to the thrust of John&#8217;s Gospel, which takes pains to identify Jesus with Galilee (cf. 1:46) and does not even mention his Judean birth. R. E. Brown typifies the contemporary approach: He regards v. 44 as an addition by a later redactor who wanted to emphasize Jesus&#8217; unsatisfactory reception in Galilee. Neither expedient is necessary, though, if <i>honor</i> is understood in its sense of attributing true worth to someone. The Galileans did welcome him, but their welcome was to prove a superficial response based on what they had seen him do at the feast. There is no indication that the signs they saw brought them to place their faith in Jesus any more than Nicodemus did on the basis of the signs. But a superficial welcome based on enthusiasm for miracles is no real honor at all.</p>
