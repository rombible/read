Pilate ordered Jesus to be flogged. A Roman governor would not carry out such a sentence in person.

Strafrecht 1899, 938f; Jos., Bell. 2, 308; 5, 449), it is odd that Pilate subsequently claims no cause for action (vs. 6); but if the latter statement refers only to the penalty of crucifixion, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;</font>. vs. 1 may be equivalent to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#953;&#948;&#949;&#973;&#969;</font> (q.v. 2b<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;</font>) in Lk 23:16, 22 (for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;</font>. of a non-capital offense PFlor I, 61, 61 [85ad]=Mitt-Wilck.

The author&#8217;s choice of wording here may constitute an allusion to Isa 50:6, &#8220;I gave my back to those who scourge me.&#8221; Three forms of corporal punishment were employed by the Romans, in increasing degree of severity: (1) <i>fustigatio</i> (beating), (2) <i>flagellatio </i>(flogging), and (3) <i>verberatio </i>(severe flogging, scourging). The first could be on occasion a punishment in itself, but the more severe forms were part of the capital sentence as a prelude to crucifixion. The most severe, <i>verberatio</i>, is what is indicated here by the Greek verb translated <i>flogged severely</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#947;&#972;&#969;</font>, <font face="Greektl">mastigow</font>). People died on occasion while being flogged this way; frequently it was severe enough to rip a person&#8217;s body open or cut muscle and sinew to the bone. It was carried out with a whip that had fragments of bone or pieces of metal bound into the tips.</p>

For the author, however, Pilate&#8217;s words constituted an unconscious allusion to Zech 6:12, &#8220;<i>Look, here is the man</i> whose name is the Branch.&#8221; In this case Pilate (unknowingly and ironically) presented Jesus to the nation under a messianic title.</p>
<A NAME="1915"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1860><b>sn</b> Crucifixion was the cruelest form of punishment practiced by the Romans. Roman citizens could not normally undergo it. It was reserved for the worst crimes, like treason and evasion of due process in a capital case. The Roman statesman and orator Cicero (106-43 <sc>b.c.) called it &#8220;a cruel and disgusting penalty&#8221; (<i>Against Verres</i> 2.5.63-66 §§163-70); Josephus (<i>J. W. </i>7.6.4 [7.203]) called it the worst of deaths.</p>
<A NAME="1916"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1861><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;him&#8221; is not in the Greek text. Direct objects were often omitted in Greek when clear from context.</p>

<A NAME="1918"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1863><b>sn</b> How are Pilate&#8217;s words &#8220;<i>You take him and crucify him</i>&#8221; to be understood? Was he offering a serious alternative to the priests who wanted Jesus crucified? Was he offering them an exception to the statement in 18:31 that the Jewish authorities did not have the power to carry out a death penalty? Although a few scholars have suggested that the situation was at this point so far out of Pilate&#8217;s control that he really was telling the high priests they could go ahead and crucify a man he had found to be innocent, this seems unlikely. It is far more likely that Pilate&#8217;s statement should be understood as one of frustration and perhaps sarcasm. This seems to be supported by the context, for the Jewish authorities make no attempt at this point to seize Jesus and crucify him. Rather they continue to pester Pilate to order the crucifixion.</p>

<A NAME="1938"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=1883><b>sn</b> Is the author using the phrase <i>Friend of Caesar</i> in a technical sense, as a title bestowed on people for loyal service to the Emperor, or in a more general sense merely describing a person as loyal to the Emperor? L. Morris (<i>John </i>[NICNT], 798) thinks it is &#8220;unlikely&#8221; that the title is used in the technical sense, and J. H. Bernard (<i>St. John</i> [ICC], 2:621) argues that the technical sense of the phrase as an official title was not used before the time of Vespasian (<sc>a.d. 69-79). But there appears to be significant evidence for much earlier usage. Some of this is given in BDAG 498-99 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#922;&#945;&#8150;&#963;&#945;&#961;</font>. E. Bammel (&#8220;<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#966;&#943;&#955;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#954;&#945;&#943;&#963;&#945;&#961;&#959;&#962;</font> (John 19:12),&#8221; <i>TLZ</i> 77 [1952]: 205-10) listed significant and convincing arguments that the official title was indeed in use at the time. Granting that the title was in use during this period, what is the likelihood that it had been bestowed on Pilate? Pilate was of the equestrian order, that is, of lower nobility as opposed to senatorial rank. As such he would have been eligible to receive such an honor. It also appears that the powerful Sejanus was his patron in Rome, and Sejanus held considerable influence with Tiberius. Tacitus (<i>Annals</i> 6.8) quotes Marcus Terentius in his defense before the Senate as saying that close friendship with Sejanus &#8220;was in every case a powerful recommendation to the Emperor&#8217;s friendship.&#8221; Thus it is possible that Pilate held this honor. Therefore it appears that the Jewish authorities were putting a good deal of psychological pressure on Pilate to convict Jesus. They had, in effect, finally specified the charge against Jesus as treason: &#8220;Everyone who makes himself to be king opposes Caesar.&#8221; If Pilate now failed to convict Jesus the Jewish authorities could complain to Rome that Pilate had released a traitor. This possibility carried more weight with Pilate than might at first be evident: (1) Pilate&#8217;s record as governor was not entirely above reproach; (2) Tiberius, who lived away from Rome as a virtual recluse on the island of Capri, was known for his suspicious nature, especially toward rivals or those who posed a political threat; and (3) worst of all, Pilate&#8217;s patron in Rome, Sejanus, had recently come under suspicion of plotting to seize the imperial succession for himself. Sejanus was deposed in October of <sc>a.d. 31. It may have been to Sejanus that Pilate owed his appointment in Judea. Pilate was now in a very delicate position. The Jewish authorities may have known something of this and deliberately used it as leverage against him. Whether or not they knew just how potent their veiled threat was, it had the desired effect. Pilate went directly to the judgment seat<i> </i>to pronounce his judgment.</p>

It was used by officials in addressing an assembly or making official pronouncements, often of a judicial nature.</p>
<A NAME="1941"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1886><b>sn</b> The precise location of the place called <i>&#8216;The Stone Pavement&#8217;</i> is still uncertain, although a paved court on the lower level of the Fortress Antonia has been suggested. It is not certain whether it was laid prior to <sc>a.d. 135, however.</p>
<A NAME="1942"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1887><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;in Hebrew.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The author does not say that <i>Gabbatha</i> is the Aramaic (or Hebrew) translation for the Greek term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#923;&#953;&#952;&#972;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#969;&#964;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Liqostrwton</font>). He simply points out that in Aramaic (or Hebrew) the place had another name. A number of meanings have been suggested, but the most likely appears to mean &#8220;elevated place.&#8221; It is possible that this was a term used by the common people for the judgment seat<i> </i>itself, which always stood on a raised platform.</p>

It could refer to any Friday as the day of preparation for the Sabbath (Saturday), and this is the way the synoptic gospels use the term (Matt 27:62, Mark 15:42, and Luke 23:54). John, however, specifies in addition that this was not only the day of preparation of the Sabbath, but also the day of preparation of the Passover, so that the Sabbath on the following day was the Passover (cf. 19:31).</p>
<A NAME="1945"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1890><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;about the sixth hour.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> For John, the time was especially important. When the note concerning the hour, <i>about noon</i>, is connected with the day, <i>the day of preparation for the Passover</i>, it becomes apparent that Jesus was going to die on the cross at the very time that the Passover lambs were being slain in the temple courts. Exod 12:6 required that the Passover lamb be kept alive until the 14th <i>Nisan</i>, the eve of the Passover, and then slaughtered by the head of the household at twilight (<i>Grk</i> &#8220;between the two evenings&#8221;). By this time the slaughtering was no longer done by the heads of households, but by the priests in the temple courts. But so many lambs were needed for the tens of thousands of pilgrims who came to Jerusalem to celebrate the feast (some estimates run in excess of 100,000 pilgrims) that the slaughter could not be completed during the evening, and so the rabbis redefined &#8220;between the two evenings&#8221; as beginning at noon, when the sun began to decline toward the horizon. Thus the priests had the entire afternoon of 14th <i>Nisan</i> in which to complete the slaughter of the Passover lambs. According to the Fourth Gospel, this is the time Jesus was dying on the cross.</p>

According to Matt 27:32 and Mark 15:21, the soldiers forced Simon to take the cross; Luke 23:26 states that the cross was placed on Simon so that it might be carried behind Jesus.

Luke 23:38 says the inscription was placed &#8220;over him&#8221; (Jesus), and Matt 27:37 that it was placed over Jesus&#8217; head. On the basis of Matthew&#8217;s statement Jesus&#8217; cross is usually depicted as the <i>crux immissa</i>, the cross which has the crossbeam set below the top of the upright beam. The other commonly used type of cross was the <i>crux commissa</i>, which had the crossbeam atop the upright beam. But Matthew&#8217;s statement is not conclusive, since with the <i>crux commissa </i>the body would have sagged downward enough to allow the placard to be placed above Jesus&#8217; head. The placard with Pilate&#8217;s inscription is mentioned in all the gospels, but for John it was certainly ironic. Jesus really was <i>the King of the Jews</i>, although he was a king rejected by his own people (cf. 1:11). Pilate&#8217;s own motivation for placing the title over Jesus is considerably more obscure. He may have meant this as a final mockery of Jesus himself, but Pilate&#8217;s earlier mockery of Jesus seemed to be motivated by a desire to gain pity from the Jewish authorities in order to have him released. More likely Pilate saw this as a subtle way of getting back at the Jewish authorities who had pressured him into the execution of one he considered to be an innocent man.</p>

It is not clear whether <i>his mother&#8217;s sister </i>and <i>Mary the wife of Clopas</i> are to be understood as the same individual (in which case only three women are mentioned: Jesus&#8217; mother, her sister Mary, and Mary Magdalene) or as two different individuals (in which case four women are mentioned: Jesus&#8217; mother, her sister, Mary Clopas&#8217; wife, and Mary Magdalene). It is impossible to be certain, but when John&#8217;s account is compared to the synoptics it is easier to reconcile the accounts if four women were present than if there were only three. It also seems that if there were four women present, this would have been seen by the author to be in juxtaposition to the four soldiers present who performed the crucifixion, and this may explain the transition from the one incident in 23-24 to the other in 25-27. Finally, if only three were present, this would mean that both Jesus&#8217; mother and her sister were named Mary, and this is highly improbable in a Jewish family of that time. If there were four women present, the name of the second, the sister of Jesus&#8217; mother, is not mentioned. It is entirely possible that the sister of Jesus&#8217; mother mentioned here is to be identified with the woman named Salome mentioned in Mark 15:40 and also with the woman identified as &#8220;the mother of the sons of Zebedee&#8221; mentioned in Matt 27:56. If so, and if John the Apostle is to be identified as the beloved disciple, then the reason for the omission of the second woman&#8217;s name becomes clear; she would have been John&#8217;s own mother, and he consistently omitted direct reference to himself or his brother James or any other members of his family in the Fourth Gospel.</p>
<A NAME="1979"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">79</span><note=1924><b>sn</b> The term <i>Woman</i> is Jesus&#8217; normal, polite way of addressing women (Matt 15:28, Luke 13:12; John 4:21; 8:10; 19:26; 20:15; see BDAG 208-9 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#965;&#957;&#8053;</font> 1). But it <i>is</i> unusual for a son to address his mother with this term. The custom in both Hebrew (or Aramaic) and Greek would be for a son to use a qualifying adjective or title. Is there significance in Jesus&#8217; use here? Jesus probably used the term here to help establish Mary and the beloved disciple in a new &#8220;mother-son&#8221; relationship. Someone would soon need to provide for Mary since Jesus, her oldest son, would no longer be alive. By using this term Jesus distanced himself from Mary so the beloved disciple could take his place as her earthly son (cf. John 2:4). See D. A. Carson, <i>John</i>, 617-18, for discussion about symbolic interpretations of this relationship between Mary and the beloved disciple.</p>

In light of the connection in the Fourth Gospel between thirst and the living water which Jesus offers, it is highly ironic that here Jesus himself, the source of that living water, expresses his thirst.

According to Josephus this law was interpreted in the 1st century to cover the bodies of those who had been crucified (<i>J. W.</i> 4.5.2 [4.317]). Philo of Alexandria also mentions that on occasion, especially at festivals, the bodies were taken down and given to relatives to bury (<i>Flaccus </i>10 [83]).

<A NAME="19101"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">101</span><note=1946><b>sn</b> How is the reference to the <i>blood and water</i> that flowed out from Jesus&#8217; side to be understood? This is probably to be connected with the statements in 1 John 5:6-8. In both passages <i>water</i>, <i>blood</i>, and <i>testimony</i> are mentioned. The Spirit is also mentioned in 1 John 5:7 as the source of the testimony, while here the testimony comes from one of the disciples (19:35). The connection between the Spirit and the living water with Jesus&#8217; statement of thirst just before he died in the preceding context has already been noted (see 19:28). For the author, the water which flowed out of Jesus&#8217; side was a symbolic reference to the Holy Spirit who could now be given because Jesus was now glorified (cf. 7:39); Jesus had now departed and returned to that glory which he had with the Father before the creation of the world (cf. 17:5). The mention of <i>blood</i> recalls the motif of the Passover lamb as a sacrificial victim. Later references to sacrificial procedures in the Mishnah appear to support this: <i>m. Pesahim</i> 5:3 and 5:5 state that the blood of the sacrificial animal should not be allowed to congeal but should flow forth freely at the instant of death so that it could be used for sprinkling; <i>m. Tamid</i> 4:2 actually specifies that the priest is to pierce the heart of the sacrificial victim and cause the blood to come forth.</p>

If one understands <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8000;&#952;&#959;&#957;&#943;&#959;&#953;&#962;</font> to refer to smaller strips of cloth, like bandages, there would be a difference, but diminutive forms have often lost their diminutive force in Koine Greek (BDF §111.3), so there may not be any difference.</p>
