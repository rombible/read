<A NAME="1914"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1859><b>sn</b> <i>Look, here is the man! </i>Pilate may have meant no more than something like &#8220;Here is the accused!&#8221; or in a contemptuous way, &#8220;Here is your king!&#8221; Others have taken Pilate&#8217;s statement as intended to evoke pity from Jesus&#8217; accusers: &#8220;Look at this poor fellow!&#8221; (Jesus would certainly not have looked very impressive after the scourging). For the author, however, Pilate&#8217;s words constituted an unconscious allusion to Zech 6:12, &#8220;<i>Look, here is the man</i> whose name is the Branch.&#8221; In this case Pilate (unknowingly and ironically) presented Jesus to the nation under a messianic title.</p>
