<A NAME="1979"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">79</span><note=1924><b>sn</b> The term <i>Woman</i> is Jesus&#8217; normal, polite way of addressing women (Matt 15:28, Luke 13:12; John 4:21; 8:10; 19:26; 20:15; see BDAG 208-9 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#965;&#957;&#8053;</font> 1). But it <i>is</i> unusual for a son to address his mother with this term. The custom in both Hebrew (or Aramaic) and Greek would be for a son to use a qualifying adjective or title. Is there significance in Jesus&#8217; use here? Jesus probably used the term here to help establish Mary and the beloved disciple in a new &#8220;mother-son&#8221; relationship. Someone would soon need to provide for Mary since Jesus, her oldest son, would no longer be alive. By using this term Jesus distanced himself from Mary so the beloved disciple could take his place as her earthly son (cf. John 2:4). See D. A. Carson, <i>John</i>, 617-18, for discussion about symbolic interpretations of this relationship between Mary and the beloved disciple.</p>
