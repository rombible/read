<A NAME="19117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">117</span><note=1962><b>tn</b> The Fourth Gospel uses <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8000;&#952;&#959;&#957;&#943;&#959;&#953;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">oqonioi&quot;</font>) to describe the wrappings, and this has caused a good deal of debate, since it appears to contradict the synoptic accounts which mention a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#953;&#957;&#948;&#8061;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">sindwn</font>), a large single piece of linen cloth. If one understands <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8000;&#952;&#959;&#957;&#943;&#959;&#953;&#962;</font> to refer to smaller strips of cloth, like bandages, there would be a difference, but diminutive forms have often lost their diminutive force in Koine Greek (BDF §111.3), so there may not be any difference.</p>
