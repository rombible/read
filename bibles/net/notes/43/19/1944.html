<A NAME="1944"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1889><b>sn</b> The term<i> day of preparation</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#963;&#954;&#949;&#965;&#8053;</font>, <font face="Greektl">paraskeuh</font>) appears in all the gospels as a description of the day on which Jesus died. It could refer to any Friday as the day of preparation for the Sabbath (Saturday), and this is the way the synoptic gospels use the term (Matt 27:62, Mark 15:42, and Luke 23:54). John, however, specifies in addition that this was not only the day of preparation of the Sabbath, but also the day of preparation of the Passover, so that the Sabbath on the following day was the Passover (cf. 19:31).</p>
