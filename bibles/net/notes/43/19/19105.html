<A NAME="19105"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">105</span><note=1950><b>sn</b> A quotation from Exod 12:46, Num 9:12, and Ps 34:20.<i> </i>A number of different OT passages lie behind this quotation: Exod 12:10 LXX, Exod 12:46, Num 9:12, or Ps 34:20. Of these, the first is the closest in form to the quotation here. The first three are all more likely candidates than the last, since the first three all deal with descriptions of the Passover lamb.</p>
