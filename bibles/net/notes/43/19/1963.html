<A NAME="1963"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">63</span><note=1908><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Pilate also wrote a notice and placed it on the cross.&#8221; The two verbs should be read as causatives, since it is highly unlikely that the Roman governor would perform either of these actions himself. He ordered them to be done.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> John says simply that the <i>notice</i> was <i>fastened to the cross</i>. Luke 23:38 says the inscription was placed &#8220;over him&#8221; (Jesus), and Matt 27:37 that it was placed over Jesus&#8217; head. On the basis of Matthew&#8217;s statement Jesus&#8217; cross is usually depicted as the <i>crux immissa</i>, the cross which has the crossbeam set below the top of the upright beam. The other commonly used type of cross was the <i>crux commissa</i>, which had the crossbeam atop the upright beam. But Matthew&#8217;s statement is not conclusive, since with the <i>crux commissa </i>the body would have sagged downward enough to allow the placard to be placed above Jesus&#8217; head. The placard with Pilate&#8217;s inscription is mentioned in all the gospels, but for John it was certainly ironic. Jesus really was <i>the King of the Jews</i>, although he was a king rejected by his own people (cf. 1:11). Pilate&#8217;s own motivation for placing the title over Jesus is considerably more obscure. He may have meant this as a final mockery of Jesus himself, but Pilate&#8217;s earlier mockery of Jesus seemed to be motivated by a desire to gain pity from the Jewish authorities in order to have him released. More likely Pilate saw this as a subtle way of getting back at the Jewish authorities who had pressured him into the execution of one he considered to be an innocent man.</p>
