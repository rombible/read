Pilate ordered Jesus to be flogged. A Roman governor would not carry out such a sentence in person.

Strafrecht 1899, 938f; Jos., Bell. 2, 308; 5, 449), it is odd that Pilate subsequently claims no cause for action (vs. 6); but if the latter statement refers only to the penalty of crucifixion, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;</font>. vs. 1 may be equivalent to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#953;&#948;&#949;&#973;&#969;</font> (q.v. 2b<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;</font>) in Lk 23:16, 22 (for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;</font>. of a non-capital offense PFlor I, 61, 61 [85ad]=Mitt-Wilck. II/2, 80 II, 61).&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This severe flogging was not administered by Pilate himself but his officers, who took Jesus at Pilate&#8217;s order and scourged him. The author&#8217;s choice of wording here may constitute an allusion to Isa 50:6, &#8220;I gave my back to those who scourge me.&#8221; Three forms of corporal punishment were employed by the Romans, in increasing degree of severity: (1) <i>fustigatio</i> (beating), (2) <i>flagellatio </i>(flogging), and (3) <i>verberatio </i>(severe flogging, scourging). The first could be on occasion a punishment in itself, but the more severe forms were part of the capital sentence as a prelude to crucifixion. The most severe, <i>verberatio</i>, is what is indicated here by the Greek verb translated <i>flogged severely</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#947;&#972;&#969;</font>, <font face="Greektl">mastigow</font>). People died on occasion while being flogged this way; frequently it was severe enough to rip a person&#8217;s body open or cut muscle and sinew to the bone. It was carried out with a whip that had fragments of bone or pieces of metal bound into the tips.</p>
