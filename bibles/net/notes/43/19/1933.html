<A NAME="1933"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1878><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;has the greater sin&#8221; (an idiom).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Because Pilate had no authority over Jesus except what had been given to him from God, the one who handed Jesus over to Pilate was <i>guilty of greater sin</i>. This does not absolve Pilate of guilt; it simply means his guilt was less than those who handed Jesus over to him, because he was not acting against Jesus out of deliberate hatred or calculated malice, like the Jewish religious authorities. These were thereby guilty of greater sin.</p>
