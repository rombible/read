<A NAME="194"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1849><b>sn</b> The <i>crown of thorns</i> was a crown plaited of some thorny material, intended as a mockery of Jesus&#8217; &#8220;kingship.&#8221; Traditionally it has been regarded as an additional instrument of torture, but it seems more probable the purpose of the thorns was not necessarily to inflict more physical suffering but to imitate the spikes of the &#8220;radiant corona,&#8221; a type of crown portrayed on ruler&#8217;s heads on many coins of the period; the spikes on this type of crown represented rays of light pointing outward (the best contemporary illustration is the crown on the head of the Statue of Liberty in New York harbor).</p>
