<A NAME="1955"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=1900><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;carrying the cross by himself.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> As was customary practice in a Roman crucifixion, the prisoner was made to carry <i>his own cross</i>. In all probability this was only the crossbeam, called in Latin the <i>patibulum</i>, since the upright beam usually remained in the ground at the place of execution. According to Matt 27:32 and Mark 15:21, the soldiers forced Simon to take the cross; Luke 23:26 states that the cross was placed on Simon so that it might be carried behind Jesus. A reasonable explanation of all this is that Jesus started out carrying the cross until he was no longer able to do so, at which point Simon was forced to take over.</p>
