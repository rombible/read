<A NAME="1945"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1890><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;about the sixth hour.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> For John, the time was especially important. When the note concerning the hour, <i>about noon</i>, is connected with the day, <i>the day of preparation for the Passover</i>, it becomes apparent that Jesus was going to die on the cross at the very time that the Passover lambs were being slain in the temple courts. Exod 12:6 required that the Passover lamb be kept alive until the 14th <i>Nisan</i>, the eve of the Passover, and then slaughtered by the head of the household at twilight (<i>Grk</i> &#8220;between the two evenings&#8221;). By this time the slaughtering was no longer done by the heads of households, but by the priests in the temple courts. But so many lambs were needed for the tens of thousands of pilgrims who came to Jerusalem to celebrate the feast (some estimates run in excess of 100,000 pilgrims) that the slaughter could not be completed during the evening, and so the rabbis redefined &#8220;between the two evenings&#8221; as beginning at noon, when the sun began to decline toward the horizon. Thus the priests had the entire afternoon of 14th <i>Nisan</i> in which to complete the slaughter of the Passover lambs. According to the Fourth Gospel, this is the time Jesus was dying on the cross.</p>
