<A NAME="19100"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">100</span><note=1945><b>sn</b> If it was obvious to the soldiers that the victim was already dead it is difficult to see why one of them would try to inflict a wound. The Greek verb <i>pierced</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#957;&#973;&#963;&#963;&#969;</font>, <font face="Greektl">nussw</font>) can indicate anything from a slight prod to a mortal wound. Probably one of the soldiers gave an exploratory stab to see if the body would jerk. If not, he was really dead. This thrust was hard enough to penetrate the side, since the author states that <i>blood and water flowed out immediately</i>.</p>
