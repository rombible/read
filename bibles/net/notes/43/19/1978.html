<A NAME="1978"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">78</span><note=1923><b>sn</b> Several women are mentioned, but it is not easy to determine how many. It is not clear whether <i>his mother&#8217;s sister </i>and <i>Mary the wife of Clopas</i> are to be understood as the same individual (in which case only three women are mentioned: Jesus&#8217; mother, her sister Mary, and Mary Magdalene) or as two different individuals (in which case four women are mentioned: Jesus&#8217; mother, her sister, Mary Clopas&#8217; wife, and Mary Magdalene). It is impossible to be certain, but when John&#8217;s account is compared to the synoptics it is easier to reconcile the accounts if four women were present than if there were only three. It also seems that if there were four women present, this would have been seen by the author to be in juxtaposition to the four soldiers present who performed the crucifixion, and this may explain the transition from the one incident in 23-24 to the other in 25-27. Finally, if only three were present, this would mean that both Jesus&#8217; mother and her sister were named Mary, and this is highly improbable in a Jewish family of that time. If there were four women present, the name of the second, the sister of Jesus&#8217; mother, is not mentioned. It is entirely possible that the sister of Jesus&#8217; mother mentioned here is to be identified with the woman named Salome mentioned in Mark 15:40 and also with the woman identified as &#8220;the mother of the sons of Zebedee&#8221; mentioned in Matt 27:56. If so, and if John the Apostle is to be identified as the beloved disciple, then the reason for the omission of the second woman&#8217;s name becomes clear; she would have been John&#8217;s own mother, and he consistently omitted direct reference to himself or his brother James or any other members of his family in the Fourth Gospel.</p>
