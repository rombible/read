<A NAME="1915"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1860><b>sn</b> Crucifixion was the cruelest form of punishment practiced by the Romans. Roman citizens could not normally undergo it. It was reserved for the worst crimes, like treason and evasion of due process in a capital case. The Roman statesman and orator Cicero (106-43 <sc>b.c.) called it &#8220;a cruel and disgusting penalty&#8221; (<i>Against Verres</i> 2.5.63-66 §§163-70); Josephus (<i>J. W. </i>7.6.4 [7.203]) called it the worst of deaths.</p>
