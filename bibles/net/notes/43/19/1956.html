<A NAME="1956"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=1901><b>sn</b> Jesus was led out to <i>the place called &#8220;The Place of the Skull&#8221;</i> where he was to be crucified. It is clear from v. 20 that this was outside the city. The Latin word for the Greek <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#961;&#945;&#957;&#943;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kranion</font>) is <i>calvaria</i>. Thus the English word &#8220;Calvary&#8221; is a transliteration of the Latin rather than a NT place name (cf. Luke 23:33 in the KJV).</p>
