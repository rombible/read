<A NAME="1995"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">95</span><note=1940><b>sn</b> <i>To have the legs&#8230;broken. </i>Breaking the legs of a crucified person was a way of speeding up his death, since the victim could no longer use his legs to push upward in order to be able to draw a breath. This breaking of the legs was called in Latin <i>crurifragium</i>, and was done with a heavy mallet.</p>
