The Hebrew word translated &#8220;Canaanite&#8221; may also be translated &#8220;merchant&#8221; or &#8220;trader.&#8221; Read in this light, Zech 14:21 states that there will be no merchant in the house of the Lord in that day (the day of the Lord, at the establishment of the messianic kingdom). And what would Jesus&#8217; words (and actions) in cleansing the temple have suggested to the observers? That Jesus was fulfilling messianic expectations would have been obvious &#8211; especially to the disciples, who had just seen the miracle at Cana with all its messianic implications.</p>
