<A NAME="245"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=172><b>tn</b> A close parallel to the aorist <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#7984;&#954;&#959;&#948;&#959;&#956;&#8053;&#952;&#951;</font> (<font face="Greektl">oikodomhqh</font>) can be found in Ezra 5:16 (LXX), where it is clear from the following verb that the construction had not yet been completed. Thus the phrase has been translated &#8220;This temple has been under construction for forty-six years.&#8221; Some, however, see the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#957;&#945;&#972;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">naos</font>) here as referring only to the sanctuary and the aorist verb as consummative, so that the meaning would be &#8220;this temple was built forty-six years ago&#8221; (so <i>ExSyn</i> 560-61). Ultimately in context the logic of the authorities&#8217; reply appears to fit more naturally if it compares length of time for original construction with length of time to reconstruct it.</p>
