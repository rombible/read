<A NAME="249"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=176><b>sn</b> <i>They believed the scripture</i> is probably an anaphoric reference to Ps 69:9 (69:10 LXX), quoted in John 2:17 above. Presumably the disciples did not remember Ps 69:9 on the spot, but it was a later insight.</p>
