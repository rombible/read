<A NAME="226"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=153><b>sn</b> With respect to Jesus&#8217; <i>brothers</i>, the so-called Helvidian view is to be preferred (named after Helvidius, a 4th-century theologian). This view holds that the most natural way to understand the phrase is as a reference to children of Joseph and Mary after the birth of Jesus. Other views are that of Epiphanius (they were children of Joseph by a former marriage) or Jerome (they were cousins). The tradition of Mary&#8217;s perpetual virginity appeared in the 2nd century and is difficult to explain (as J. H. Bernard, <i>St. John</i> [ICC],<i> </i>1:85, points out) if some of her other children were prominent members of the early church (e.g., James of Jerusalem). But this is outweighed by the natural sense of the words.</p>
