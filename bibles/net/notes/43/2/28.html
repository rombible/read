<A NAME="28"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=135><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Woman, what to me and to you?&#8221; (an idiom). The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#943; &#7952;&#956;&#959;&#8054; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#963;&#959;&#943;</font>,<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> &#947;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ti emoi kai soi, gunai</font>) is Semitic in origin. The equivalent Hebrew expression in the Old Testament had two basic meanings: (1) When one person was unjustly bothering another, the injured party could say &#8220;What to me and to you?&#8221; meaning, &#8220;What have I done to you that you should do this to me?&#8221; (Judg 11:12, 2 Chr 35:21, 1 Kgs 17:18). (2) When someone was asked to get involved in a matter he felt was no business of his, he could say to the one asking him, &#8220;What to me and to you?&#8221; meaning, &#8220;That is your business, how am I involved?&#8221; (2 Kgs 3:13, Hos 14:8). Option (1) implies hostility, while option (2) implies merely disengagement. Mere disengagement is almost certainly to be understood here as better fitting the context (although some of the Greek Fathers took the remark as a rebuke to Mary, such a rebuke is unlikely).</p>
