<A NAME="248"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">48</span><note=175><b>tn</b> The genitive &#8220;of his body&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#963;&#8061;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</font>, <font face="Greektl">tou swmato&quot; autou</font>) is a genitive of apposition, clarifying which temple Jesus was referring to. Thus, Jesus not only was referring to his <i>physical</i> resurrection, but also to his <i>participation</i> in the resurrection process. The New Testament thus records the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as all performing the miracle of Christ's resurrection.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Jesus was speaking about the temple of his body. </i>For the author, the temple is not just the building, it is Jesus&#8217; resurrected <i>body</i>. Compare the nonlocalized worship mentioned in John 4:21-23, and also Rev 21:22 (there is to be no temple in the New Jerusalem; the Lord and the Lamb are its temple). John points to the fact that, as the place where men go in order to meet God, the temple has been supplanted and replaced by Jesus himself, in whose resurrected person people may now encounter God (see John 1:18, 14:6).</p>
