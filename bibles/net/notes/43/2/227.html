<A NAME="227"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=154><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the Passover of the Jews.&#8221; This is first of at least three (and possibly four) Passovers mentioned in John&#8217;s Gospel. If it is assumed that the Passovers appear in the Gospel in their chronological order (and following a date of <sc>a.d. 33 for the crucifixion), this would be the Passover of the spring of <sc>a.d. 30, the first of Jesus&#8217; public ministry. There is a clear reference to another Passover in 6:4, and another still in 11:55, 12:1, 13:1, 18:28, 39, and 19:14. The latter would be the Passover of <sc>a.d. 33. There is a possibility that 5:1 also refers to a Passover, in which case it would be the second of Jesus&#8217; public ministry (<sc>a.d. 31), while 6:4 would refer to the third (<sc>a.d. 32) and the remaining references would refer to the final Passover at the time of the crucifixion. It is entirely possible, however, that the Passovers occurring in the Fourth Gospel are not intended to be understood as listed in chronological sequence. If the material of the Fourth Gospel originally existed in the form of homilies or sermons by the Apostle John on the life and ministry of Jesus, the present arrangement would not have to be in strict chronological order (it does not explicitly claim to be). In this case the Passover mentioned in 2:13, for example, might actually be later in Jesus&#8217; public ministry than it might at first glance appear. This leads, however, to a discussion of an even greater problem in the passage, the relationship of the temple cleansing in John&#8217;s Gospel to the similar account in the synoptic gospels.</p>
