<A NAME="241"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=168><b>sn</b> The request &#8220;<i>What sign can you show us</i>&#8221; by Jesus&#8217; adversaries was a request for a defense of his actions &#8211; a mark of divine authentication. Whether this was a request for a miracle is not entirely clear. Jesus never obliged such a request. Yet, ironically, the only <i>sign</i> the Jewish leadership will get is that predicted by Jesus in 2:19 &#8211; his crucifixion and resurrection. Cf. the &#8220;sign of Jonah&#8221; in the synoptics (Matt 12:39, 40; Luke 11:29-32).</p>
