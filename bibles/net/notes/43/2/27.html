<A NAME="27"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=134><b>sn</b> The term <i>Woman</i> is Jesus&#8217; normal, polite way of addressing women (Matt 15:28, Luke 13:12; John 4:21; 8:10; 19:26; 20:15). But it <i>is</i> unusual for a son to address his mother with this term. The custom in both Hebrew (or Aramaic) and Greek would be for a son to use a qualifying adjective or title. Is there significance in Jesus&#8217; use here? It probably indicates that a new relationship existed between Jesus and his mother once he had embarked on his public ministry. He was no longer or primarily only her son, but the &#8220;Son of Man.&#8221; This is also suggested by the use of the same term in 19:26 in the scene at the cross, where the beloved disciple is &#8220;given&#8221; to Mary as her &#8220;new&#8221; son.</p>
