<A NAME="225"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=152><b>sn</b> Verse 12 is merely a transitional note in the narrative (although <i>Capernaum</i> does not lie on the direct route to Jerusalem from Cana). Nothing is mentioned in John&#8217;s Gospel at this point about anything Jesus said or did there (although later his teaching is mentioned, see 6:59). From the synoptics it is clear that Capernaum was a center of Jesus&#8217; Galilean ministry and might even be called &#8220;his own town&#8221; (Matt 9:1). The royal official whose son Jesus healed (John 4:46-54) was from Capernaum. He may have heard Jesus speak there, or picked up the story about the miracle at Cana from one of Jesus&#8217; disciples.</p><p class="footnote"><b>map</b> For location see Map1-D2; Map2-C3; Map3-B2.</p>
