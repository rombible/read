<A NAME="22"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=129><b>sn</b> <i>Cana in Galilee</i> was not a very well-known place. It is mentioned only here, in 4:46, and 21:2, and nowhere else in the NT. Josephus (<i>Life </i>16 [86]) says he once had his quarters there. The probable location is present day Khirbet Cana, 8 mi (14 km) north of Nazareth, or Khirbet Kenna, 4 mi (7 km) northeast of Nazareth.</p>
