<A NAME="29"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=136><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;my hour&#8221; (referring to the time of Jesus&#8217; crucifixion and return to the Father).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The Greek word translated <i>time</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8037;&#961;&#945;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Jwra</font>) occurs in John 2:4; 4:21, 23; 5:25, 28, 29; 7:30; 8:20; 12:23, 27; 13:1; 16:25; and 17:1. It is a reference to the special period in Jesus&#8217; life when he was to leave this world and return to the Father (13:1); the hour when the Son of man is glorified (17:1). This is accomplished through his suffering, death, resurrection (and ascension &#8211; though this last is not emphasized by John). John 7:30 and 8:20 imply that Jesus&#8217; arrest and death are included. John 12:23 and 17:1, referring to the glorification of the Son, imply that the resurrection and ascension are included as part of the &#8220;hour.&#8221; In John 2:4 Jesus&#8217; remark to his mother indicates that the time for this self-manifestation has not yet arrived; his identity as Messiah is not yet to be publicly revealed.</p>
