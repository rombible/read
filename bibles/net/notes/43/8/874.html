<A NAME="874"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">74</span><note=783><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;who commits.&#8221; This could simply be translated, &#8220;everyone who sins,&#8221; but the Greek is more emphatic, using the participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#959;&#953;&#8182;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">poiwn</font>) in a construction with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#8118;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pas</font>), a typical Johannine construction. Here repeated, continuous action is in view. The one whose lifestyle is characterized by repeated, continuous sin is a slave to sin. That one is not free; sin has enslaved him. To break free from this bondage requires outside (divine) intervention. Although the statement is true at the general level (the person who continually practices a lifestyle of sin is enslaved to sin) the particular sin of the Jewish authorities, repeatedly emphasized in the Fourth Gospel, is the sin of unbelief. The present tense in this instance looks at the continuing refusal on the part of the Jewish leaders to acknowledge who Jesus is, in spite of mounting evidence.</p>
