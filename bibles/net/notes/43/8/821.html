<A NAME="821"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=730><b>sn</b> The theory proposed by F. J. A. Hort (<i>The New Testament in the Original Greek, </i>vol. 2, <i>Introduction; Appendix</i>, 87-88), that the backdrop of 8:12 is the lighting of the candelabra in the court of women, may offer a plausible setting to the proclamation by Jesus that he is <i>the light of the world</i>. The last time that Jesus spoke in the narrative (assuming 7:53-8:11 is not part of the original text, as the textual evidence suggests) is in 7:38, where he was speaking to a crowd of pilgrims in the temple area. This is where he is found in the present verse, and he may be addressing the crowd again. Jesus&#8217; remark has to be seen in view of both the prologue (John 1:4, 5) and the end of the discourse with Nicodemus (John 3:19-21). The coming of Jesus into the world provokes judgment: A choosing up of sides becomes necessary. The one who comes to the light, that is, who follows Jesus, will <i>not</i> walk in the darkness. The one who refuses to come, <i>will</i> walk in the darkness. In this contrast, there are only two alternatives. So it is with a person&#8217;s decision about Jesus. Furthermore, this serves as in implicit indictment of Jesus&#8217; opponents, who still walk in the darkness, because they refuse to come to him. This sets up the contrast in chap. 9 between the man born blind, who receives both physical and spiritual sight, and the Pharisees (John 9:13, 15, 16) who have physical sight but remain in spiritual darkness.</p>
