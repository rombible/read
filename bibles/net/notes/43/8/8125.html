<A NAME="8125"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">125</span><note=834><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;and have a demon.&#8221; It is not clear what is meant by the charge <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#931;&#945;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#943;&#964;&#951;&#962; &#949;&#7990; &#963;&#8058; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#948;&#945;&#953;&#956;&#972;&#957;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#7956;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Samarith&quot; ei su kai daimonion ecei&quot;</font>). The meaning could be &#8220;you are a heretic and are possessed by a demon.&#8221; Note that the dual charge gets one reply (John 8:49). Perhaps the phrases were interchangeable: Simon Magus (Acts 8:14-24) and in later traditions Dositheus, the two Samaritans who claimed to be sons of God, were regarded as mad, that is, possessed by demons.</p>
