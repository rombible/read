<A NAME="840"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=749><b>tn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#945;&#950;&#959;&#966;&#965;&#955;&#940;&#954;&#953;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">gazofulakion</font>) can be translated &#8220;treasury&#8221; or &#8220;treasure room&#8221; in this context. BDAG 186 s.v. 1 notes, &#8220;It can be taken in this sense J 8:20 (sing.) <i>in</i> (or <i>at</i>) <i>the treasury</i>.&#8221; BDAG 186 s.v. 2 argues that the occurrences of this word in the synoptic gospels also refer to the treasury: &#8220;For Mk 12:41, 43; Lk 21:1 the mng. <i>contribution box</i> or <i>receptacle</i> is attractive. Acc. to Mishnah, Shekalim 6, 5 there were in the temple 13 such receptacles in the form of trumpets. But even in these passages the general sense of &#8216;treasury&#8217; is prob., for the contributions would go [into] the treasury via the receptacles.&#8221; Based upon the extra-biblical evidence (see <b>sn</b> following), however, the translation opts to refer to the actual receptacles and not the treasury itself.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The <i>offering box</i> probably refers to the receptacles in the temple forecourt by the Court of Women used to collect freewill offerings. These are mentioned by Josephus, <i>J. W.</i> 5.5.2 (5.200), 6.5.2 (6.282); <i>Ant.</i> 19.6.1 (19.294); and in 1 Macc 14:49 and 2 Macc 3:6, 24, 28, 40 (see also Mark 12:41; Luke 21:1).</p>
