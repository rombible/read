<A NAME="898"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">98</span><note=807><b>sn</b> <i>We were not born as a result of immorality!</i> is ironic, because Jesus&#8217; opponents implied that it was not themselves but Jesus who had been born as a result of immoral behavior. This shows they did not know Jesus&#8217; true origin and were not aware of the supernatural events surrounding his birth. The author does not even bother to refute the opponents&#8217; suggestion but lets it stand, assuming his readers will know the true story.</p>
