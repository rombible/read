<A NAME="8154"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">154</span><note=863><b>tn</b> What is the meaning of Jesus&#8217; statement that the patriarch Abraham &#8220;saw&#8221; his day and rejoiced? The use of past tenses would seem to refer to something that occurred during the patriarch&#8217;s lifetime. <i>Genesis Rabbah</i> 44:25ff, (cf. 59:6) states that Rabbi Akiba, in a debate with Rabbi Johanan ben Zakkai, held that Abraham had been shown not this world only but the world to come (this would include the days of the Messiah). More realistically, it is likely that Gen 22:13-15 lies behind Jesus&#8217; words. This passage, known to rabbis as the <i>Akedah</i> (&#8220;Binding&#8221;), tells of Abraham finding the ram which will replace his son Isaac on the altar of sacrifice &#8211; an occasion of certain rejoicing.</p>
