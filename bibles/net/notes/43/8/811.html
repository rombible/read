<A NAME="811"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=720><b>tn</b> Or possibly &#8220;Jesus bent down and wrote an accusation on the ground with his finger.&#8221; The Greek verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#947;&#961;&#940;&#966;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">katagrafw</font>) may indicate only the action of writing on the ground by Jesus, but in the overall context (Jesus&#8217; response to the accusation against the woman) it can also be interpreted as implying that what Jesus wrote was a counteraccusation against the accusers (although there is no clue as to the actual content of what he wrote, some scribes added &#8220;the sins of each one of them&#8221; either here or at the end of v. 8 [U 264 700 <i>al</i>]).</p>
