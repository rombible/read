<A NAME="831"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=740><b>sn</b> What is the meaning of Jesus&#8217; statement &#8220;<i>I do not judge anyone</i>&#8221;? It is clear that Jesus did judge (even in the next verse). The point is that he didn&#8217;t practice the same kind of judgment that the Pharisees did. Their kind of judgment was condemnatory. They tried to condemn people. Jesus did not come to judge the world, but to save it (3:17). Nevertheless, and not contradictory to this, the coming of Jesus did bring judgment, because it forced people to make a choice. Would they accept Jesus or reject him? Would they come to the light or shrink back into the darkness? As they responded, so were they judged &#8211; just as 3:19-21 previously stated. One&#8217;s response to Jesus determines one&#8217;s eternal destiny.</p>
