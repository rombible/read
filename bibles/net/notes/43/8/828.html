<A NAME="828"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=737><b>sn</b> <i>You people do not know where I came from or where I am going. </i>The ignorance of the religious authorities regarding Jesus&#8217; origin works on two levels at once: First, they thought Jesus came from Galilee (although he really came from Bethlehem in Judea) and second, they did not know that he came from heaven (from the Father), and this is where he would return. See further John 7:52.</p>
