<A NAME="896"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">96</span><note=805><b>tc</b> &#8225; Important and early witnesses (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B L W 070 it sy<sup>s,p</sup> co) lack the conjunction here, while the earliest witnesses along with many others read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">oun</font>, &#8220;therefore&#8221;; <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>66,75</sup> C D <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920; &#936; </font>0250 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13</sup> 33 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>). This conjunction occurs in John some 200 times, far more than in any other NT book. Even though the combined testimony of two early papyri for the conjunction is impressive, the reading seems to be a predictable scribal emendation. In particular, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</font> is frequently used with the plural of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7990;&#960;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">eipon</font>, &#8220;they said&#8221;) in John (in this chapter alone, note vv. 13, 39, 48, 57, and possibly 52). On balance, it is probably best to consider the shorter reading as authentic, even though &#8220;Then&#8221; is virtually required in translation for English stylistic reasons. NA<sup>27</sup> has the conjunction in brackets, indicating some doubt as to its authenticity.</p>
