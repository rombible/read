<A NAME="869"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">69</span><note=778><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the truth will release you.&#8221; The translation &#8220;set you free&#8221; or &#8220;release you&#8221; (unlike the more traditional &#8220;make you free&#8221;) conveys more the idea that the hearers were currently in a state of slavery from which they needed to be freed. The following context supports precisely this idea.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The statement<i> the truth will set you free</i> is often taken as referring to <i>truth</i> in the philosophical (or absolute) sense, or in the intellectual sense, or even (as the Jews apparently took it) in the political sense. In the context of John&#8217;s Gospel (particularly in light of the prologue) this must refer to <i>truth </i>about the person and work of Jesus. It is saving truth. As L. Morris says, &#8220;it is the truth which saves men from the darkness of sin, not that which saves them from the darkness of error (though there is a sense in which men in Christ are delivered from gross error)&#8221; (<i>John </i>[NICNT], 457).</p>
