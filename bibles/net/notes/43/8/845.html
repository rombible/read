<A NAME="845"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=754><b>tn</b> The expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8022;&#957; &#960;&#940;&#955;&#953;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">oun palin</font>) indicates some sort of break in the sequence of events, but it is not clear how long. The author does not mention the interval between 8:12-20 and this next recorded dialogue. The feast of Tabernacles is past, and the next reference to time is 10:22, where the feast of the Dedication is mentioned. The interval is two months, and these discussions could have taken place at any time within that interval, as long as one assumes something of a loose chronological framework. However, if the material in the Fourth Gospel is arranged theologically or thematically, such an assumption would not apply.</p>
