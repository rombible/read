<A NAME="866"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=775><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;to the Jews.&#8221; In NT usage the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#959;&#965;&#948;&#945;&#8150;&#959;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Ioudaioi</font>) may refer to the entire Jewish people, the residents of Jerusalem and surrounding territory (i.e., &#8220;Judeans&#8221;), the authorities in Jerusalem, or merely those who were hostile to Jesus. (For further information see R. G. Bratcher, &#8220;&#8216;The Jews&#8217; in the Gospel of John,&#8221; <i>BT </i>26 [1975]: 401-9; also BDAG 479 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#959;&#965;&#948;&#945;&#8150;&#959;&#962;</font> 2.e.) Here the phrase refers to the Jewish people in Jerusalem who had been listening to Jesus&#8217; teaching in the temple and had believed his claim to be the Messiah, hence, &#8220;those Judeans who had believed him.&#8221; The term &#8220;Judeans&#8221; is preferred here to the more general &#8220;people&#8221; because the debate concerns descent from Abraham (v. 33).</p>
