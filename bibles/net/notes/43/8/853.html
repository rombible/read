<A NAME="853"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=762><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;unless you believe that I am.&#8221; In this context there is an implied predicate nominative (&#8220;he&#8221;) following the &#8220;I am&#8221; phrase. What Jesus&#8217; hearers had to acknowledge is that he was who he claimed to be, i.e., the Messiah (cf. 20:31). This view is also reflected in English translations like NIV (&#8220;if you do not believe that I am the one I claim to be&#8221;), NLT (&#8220;unless you believe that I am who I say I am&#8221;), and CEV (&#8220;if you don&#8217;t have faith in me for who I am&#8221;). For a different view that takes this &#8220;I am&#8221; and the one in 8:28 as nonpredicated (i.e., absolute), see R. E. Brown, <i>John </i>(AB), 1:533-38. Such a view refers sees the nonpredicated &#8220;I am&#8221; as a reference to the divine Name revealed in Exod 3:14, and is reflected in English translations like NAB (&#8220;if you do not believe that I AM, you will die in your sins&#8221;) and TEV (&#8220;you will die in your sins if you do not believe that &#8216;I Am Who I Am&#8217;&#8221;).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> See the note on <i>Christ</i> in 1:20.</p>
