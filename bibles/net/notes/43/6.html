<A NAME="61"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=450><b>tn</b> Again, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#949;&#964;&#8048; &#964;&#945;&#8166;&#964;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">meta tauta</font>) is a vague temporal reference. How Jesus got from Jerusalem to Galilee is not explained, which has led many scholars (e.g., Bernard, Bultmann, and Schnackenburg) to posit either editorial redaction or some sort of rearrangement or dislocation of material (such as reversing the order of chaps. 5 and 6, for example). Such a rearrangement of the material would give a simple and consistent connection of events, but in the absence of all external evidence it does not seem to be supportable. R. E. Brown (<i>John </i>[AB], 1:236) says that such an arrangement is attractive in some ways but not compelling, and that no rearrangement can solve all the geographical and chronological problems in John.</p>
<A NAME="62"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=451><b>sn</b> This is a parenthetical note by the author. Only John in the New Testament refers to the Sea of Galilee by the name <i>Sea of Tiberias</i> (see also John 21:1), but this is correct local usage. In the mid-20&#8217;s Herod completed the building of the town of Tiberias on the southwestern shore of the lake; after this time the name came into use for the lake itself.</p>

The ministry of miracles in Galilee, ending with this, the multiplication of the bread (the last public miracle in Galilee recorded by John) aroused such a popular response that there was danger of an uprising. This would have given the authorities a legal excuse to arrest Jesus. The nature of Jesus&#8217; kingship will become an issue again in the passion narrative of the Fourth Gospel (John 18:33ff.). Furthermore, the volatile reaction of the Galileans to the signs prepares for and foreshadows the misunderstanding of the miracle itself, and even the misunderstanding of Jesus&#8217; explanation of it (John 6:22-71).</p>

Although the shorter reading has minimal support, it is significant that this Gospel speaks of Jesus as Lord in the evangelist&#8217;s narrative descriptions only in 11:2; 20:18, 20; 21:12; and possibly 4:1 (but see <b>tc</b> note on &#8220;Jesus&#8221; there). There is thus but one undisputed preresurrection text in which the narrator calls Jesus &#8220;Lord.&#8221; This fact can be utilized on behalf of either reading: The participial phrase could be seen as a scribal addition harking back to 6:11 but which does not fit Johannine style, or it could be viewed as truly authentic and in line with what John indisputably does elsewhere even if rarely. On balance, in light of the overwhelming support for these words it is probably best to retain them in the text.</p>

John 6:23). Jesus&#8217; disciples set sail for Capernaum (6:17) and were joined by the Lord in the middle of the sea. The next day boats from Tiberias picked up a few of those who had seen the multiplication (certainly not the whole 5,000) and brought them to Capernaum. It was to this group that Jesus spoke in 6:26-27. But there were also people from Capernaum who had gathered to see Jesus, who had <i>not</i> witnessed the multiplication, and it was <i>this</i> group that asked Jesus for a miraculous sign like the manna (6:30-31). This would have seemed superfluous if it were the same crowd that had already seen the multiplication of the bread. But some from Capernaum had heard about it and wanted to see a similar miracle repeated.</p>

It is possible that the <sc>mss that lack the pronoun preserve the original wording here, with the rest of the witnesses adding the pronoun for clarity&#8217;s sake. This likelihood increases since the object is not required in Greek. Without it, however, ambiguity increases: The referent could be &#8220;me&#8221; or it could be &#8220;signs,&#8221; reaching back to vv. 26 and 30. However, the oblique form of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#947;&#8061;</font> (<font face="Greektl">egw</font>, the first person personal pronoun) occurs some two dozen times in this chapter alone, yet it vacillates between the emphatic form and the unemphatic form. Although generally the unemphatic form is used with verbs, there are several exceptions to this in John (cf. 8:12; 12:26, 45, 48; 13:20; 14:9). If the pronoun is a later addition here, one wonders why it is so consistently the unemphatic form in the <sc>mss. Further, that two unrelated Greek witnesses lack this small word could easily be due to accidental deletion. Finally, the date and diversity of the witnesses for the pronoun are so weighty that it is likely to be authentic and should thus be retained in the text.</p>

According to <i>ExSyn</i> 249, &#8220;A curious phenomenon has occurred in the English Bible with reference to one particular monadic noun, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#940;&#946;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font>. The KJV translates both <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#940;&#946;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font> and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#945;&#953;&#956;&#972;&#957;&#953;&#959;&#957;</font> as &#8216;devil.&#8217; Thus in the AV translators&#8217; minds, &#8216;devil&#8217; was not a monadic noun. Modern translations have correctly rendered <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#945;&#953;&#956;&#972;&#957;&#953;&#959;&#957;</font> as &#8216;demon&#8217; and have, for the most part, recognized that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#940;&#946;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font> is monadic (cf., e.g., 1 Pet 5:8; Rev 20:2). But in John 6:70 modern translations have fallen into the error of the King James translators. The KJV has &#8216;one of you is a devil.&#8217; So does the RSV, NRSV, ASV, NIV, NKJV, and the JB [Jerusalem Bible]. Yet there is only one devil&#8230;The legacy of the KJV still lives on, then, even in places where it ought not.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="6120"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">120</span><note=569><b>sn</b> At least six explanations for the name <i>Iscariot</i> have been proposed, but it is probably transliterated Hebrew with the meaning &#8220;man of Kerioth&#8221; (there are at least two villages that had that name). See D. A. Carson, <i>John</i>, 304.</p>
<A NAME="6121"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">121</span><note=570><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;this one&#8221;; the referent (Judas) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</p>
<A NAME="6122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">122</span><note=571><b>sn</b> This parenthetical statement by the author helps the reader understand Jesus&#8217; statement <i>one of you is the devil </i>in the previous verse. This is the first mention of <i>Judas</i> in the Fourth Gospel, and he is immediately identified (as he is in the synoptic gospels, Matt 10:4, Mark 3:19, Luke 6:16) as the one who would<i> betray</i> Jesus.</p>
