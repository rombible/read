<A NAME="48"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=262><b>sn</b> <i>Samaria. </i>The Samaritans were descendants of 2 groups: (1) The remnant of native Israelites who were not deported after the fall of the Northern Kingdom in 722 <sc>b.c.; (2) Foreign colonists brought in from Babylonia and Media by the Assyrian conquerors to settle the land with inhabitants who would be loyal to Assyria. There was theological opposition between the Samaritans and the Jews because the former refused to worship in Jerusalem. After the exile the Samaritans put obstacles in the way of the Jewish restoration of Jerusalem, and in the 2nd century <sc>b.c. the Samaritans helped the Syrians in their wars against the Jews. In 128 <sc>b.c. the Jewish high priest retaliated and burned the Samaritan temple on Mount Gerizim.</p>
