<A NAME="41"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=255><b>tc</b> Several early and important witnesses, along with the majority of later ones (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>66c,75</sup> A B C L W<sup>s</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 083 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13</sup> 33 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> sa), have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#973;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kurio&quot;</font>, &#8220;Lord&#8221;) here instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Ihsou&quot;</font>, &#8220;Jesus&#8221;). As significant as this external support is, the internal evidence seems to be on the side of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</font>. &#8220;Jesus&#8221; is mentioned two more times in the first two verses of chapter four in a way that is stylistically awkward (so much so that the translation has substituted the pronoun for the first one; see <b>tn</b> note below). This seems to be sufficient reason to motivate scribes to change the wording to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#973;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#962;</font>. Further, the reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962; </font>is not without decent support, though admittedly not as strong as that for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#973;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>66*</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> </font>D <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920; </font>086 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1</sup> 565 1241 <i>al</i> lat bo). On the other hand, this Gospel speaks of Jesus as Lord in the evangelist&#8217;s narrative descriptions elsewhere only in 11:2; 20:18, 20; 21:12; and probably 6:23, preferring <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</font> most of the time. This fact could be used to argue that scribes, acquainted with John&#8217;s style, changed <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#973;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#962; </font>to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</font>. But the immediate context generally is weighed more heavily than an author&#8217;s style. It is possible that neither word was in the original text and scribes supplied what they thought most appropriate (see <i>TCGNT</i> 176). But without ms evidence to this effect coupled with the harder reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</font>, this conjecture must remain doubtful. All in all, it is best to regard <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</font> as the original reading here.</p>
