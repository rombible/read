<A NAME="46"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=260><b>sn</b> The author doesn&#8217;t tell why Jesus chose to <i>set out once more for Galilee</i>. Some have suggested that the Pharisees turned their attention to Jesus because John the Baptist had now been thrown into prison. But the text gives no hint of this. In any case, perhaps Jesus simply did not want to provoke a confrontation at this time (knowing that his &#8220;hour&#8221; had not yet come).</p>
