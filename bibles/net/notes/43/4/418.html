<A NAME="418"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=272><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;a Judean.&#8221; Here BDAG 478 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#959;&#965;&#948;&#945;&#943;&#959;&#962;</font> 2.a states, &#8220;Judean (with respect to birth, nationality, or cult).&#8221; The same term occurs in the plural later in this verse. In one sense &#8220;Judean&#8221; would work very well in the translation here, since the contrast is between residents of the two geographical regions. However, since in the context of this chapter the discussion soon becomes a religious rather than a territorial one (cf. vv. 19-26), the translation &#8220;Jew&#8221; has been retained here and in v. 22.</p>
