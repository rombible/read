<A NAME="4114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">114</span><note=368><b>tn</b> This sentence in Greek involves an object-complement construction. The force can be either &#8220;Jesus did this as,&#8221; or possibly &#8220;Jesus made this to be.&#8221; The latter translation accents not only Jesus&#8217; power but his sovereignty too. Cf. 2:11 where the same construction occurs.</p>
