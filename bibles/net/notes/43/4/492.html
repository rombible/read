<A NAME="492"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">92</span><note=346><b>sn</b> There is irony in the Samaritans&#8217; declaration that Jesus was really <i>the Savior of the world</i>, an irony foreshadowed in the prologue to the Fourth Gospel (1:11): &#8220;He came to his own, and his own did not receive him.&#8221; Yet the Samaritans welcomed Jesus and proclaimed him to be not the Jewish Messiah only, but <i>the Savior of the world</i>.</p>
