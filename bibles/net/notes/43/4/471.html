<A NAME="471"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=325><b>tn</b> The use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#8053;&#964;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">mhti</font>) normally presupposes a negative answer. This should not be taken as an indication that the woman did not believe, however. It may well be an example of &#8220;reverse psychology,&#8221; designed to gain a hearing for her testimony among those whose doubts about her background would obviate her claims.</p>
