<A NAME="427"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=281><b>tc</b> &#8225; Two early and important Greek <sc>mss along with two versional witnesses (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>75 </sup>B sy<sup>s</sup> ac<sup>2</sup>) lack <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969; &#947;&#965;&#957;&#8053;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jh gunh</font>, &#8220;the woman&#8221;) here; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#957;&#951;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ekeinh</font>, &#8220;that one&#8221; or possibly &#8220;she&#8221;) instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969; &#947;&#965;&#957;&#8053;</font>. It is possible that no explicit subject was in the original text and scribes added either <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969; &#947;&#965;&#957;&#8053;</font> or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#957;&#951;</font> to make the meaning clear. It is also possible that the archetype of <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>75 </sup><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> </font>B expunged the subject because it was not altogether necessary, with the scribe of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> </font>later adding the pronoun. However, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969; &#947;&#965;&#957;&#8053;</font> is not in doubt in any other introduction to the woman&#8217;s words in this chapter (cf. vv. 9, 15, 17, 19, 25), suggesting that intentional deletion was not the motive for the shorter reading in v. 11 (or else why would they delete the words <i>only</i> here?). Thus, the fact that virtually all witnesses (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>66 </sup><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>2</sup> A C D L W<sup>s</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920; &#936; </font>050 083 086 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13</sup> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font><font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> </font>latt sy<sup>c,p,h </sup>sa bo) have <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969; &#947;&#965;&#957;&#8053;</font> here may suggest that it is a motivated reading, conforming this verse to the rest of the pericope. Although a decision is difficult, it is probably best to regard the shorter reading as authentic. NA<sup>27</sup> has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969; &#947;&#965;&#957;&#8053;</font> in brackets, indicating doubts as to their authenticity. For English stylistic reasons, the translation also includes &#8220;the woman&#8221; here.</p>
