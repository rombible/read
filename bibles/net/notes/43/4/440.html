<A NAME="440"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=294><b>tc</b> Most witnesses have &#8220;Jesus&#8221; here, either with the article (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>c</sup> C<sup>2</sup> D L W<sup>s</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936; </font>086 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font><font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> </font>lat) or without (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* A <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920; </font><font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13</sup> <i>al</i>), while several important and early witnesses lack the name (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>66,75</sup> B C* 33<sup>vid</sup> <i>pc</i>). It is unlikely that scribes would have deliberately expunged the name of Jesus from the text here, especially since it aids the reader with the flow of the dialogue. Further, that the name occurs both anarthrously and with the article suggests that it was a later addition. (For similar arguments, see the <b>tc</b> note on &#8220;woman&#8221; in 4:11). </p>
