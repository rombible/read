<A NAME="432"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=286><b>tn</b> Questions prefaced with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#8053;</font> (<font face="Greektl">mh</font>) in Greek anticipate a negative answer. This can sometimes be indicated by using a &#8220;tag&#8221; at the end. In this instance all of v. 12 is one question. It has been broken into two sentences for the sake of English style (instead of &#8220;for he&#8221; the Greek reads &#8220;who&#8221;).</p>
