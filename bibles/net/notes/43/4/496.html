<A NAME="496"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">96</span><note=350><b>sn</b> <i>John 4:44-45. </i>The last part of v. 45 is a parenthetical note by the author. The major problem in these verses concerns the contradiction between the proverb stated by Jesus in v. 44 and the reception of the Galileans in v. 45. Origen solved the problem by referring <i>his own country</i> to Judea (which Jesus had just left) and not Galilee. But this runs counter to the thrust of John&#8217;s Gospel, which takes pains to identify Jesus with Galilee (cf. 1:46) and does not even mention his Judean birth. R. E. Brown typifies the contemporary approach: He regards v. 44 as an addition by a later redactor who wanted to emphasize Jesus&#8217; unsatisfactory reception in Galilee. Neither expedient is necessary, though, if <i>honor</i> is understood in its sense of attributing true worth to someone. The Galileans did welcome him, but their welcome was to prove a superficial response based on what they had seen him do at the feast. There is no indication that the signs they saw brought them to place their faith in Jesus any more than Nicodemus did on the basis of the signs. But a superficial welcome based on enthusiasm for miracles is no real honor at all.</p>
