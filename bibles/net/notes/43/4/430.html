<A NAME="430"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=284><b>sn</b> <i>Where then do you get this living water? </i>The woman&#8217;s reply is an example of the &#8220;misunderstood statement,&#8221; a technique appearing frequently in John&#8217;s Gospel. Jesus was speaking of <i>living water</i> which was spiritual (ultimately a Johannine figure for the Holy Spirit, see John 7:38-39), but the woman thought he was speaking of flowing (fresh drinkable) water. Her misunderstanding gave Jesus the opportunity to explain what he really meant.</p>
