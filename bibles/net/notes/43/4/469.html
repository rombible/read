<A NAME="469"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">69</span><note=323><b>tn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anqrwpoi</font>) used here can mean either &#8220;people&#8221; (when used generically) or &#8220;men&#8221; (though there is a more specific term in Greek for adult males, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#957;&#8053;&#961;</font> [<font face="Greektl">anhr</font>]). Thus the woman could have been speaking either (1) to all the people or (2) to the male leaders of the city as their representatives. However, most recent English translations regard the former as more likely and render the word &#8220;people&#8221; here.</p>
