<A NAME="1245"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1261><b>sn</b> Jesus&#8217; reply, <i>the time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified</i>, is a bit puzzling. As far as the author&#8217;s account is concerned, Jesus totally ignores these Greeks and makes no further reference to them whatsoever. It appears that his words are addressed to Andrew and Philip, but in fact they must have had a wider audience, including possibly the Greeks who had wished to see him in the first place. The words <i>the time has come </i>recall all the previous references to &#8220;the hour&#8221; throughout the Fourth Gospel (see the note on <i>time</i> in 2:4). There is no doubt, in light of the following verse, that Jesus refers to his death here. On his pathway to glorification lies the cross, and it is just ahead.</p>
