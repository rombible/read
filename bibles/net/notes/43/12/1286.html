<A NAME="1286"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">86</span><note=1302><b>tn</b> One could also translate <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#964;&#961;&#945;&#966;&#8182;&#963;&#953;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">strafwsin</font>) as &#8220;repent&#8221; or &#8220;change their ways,&#8221; but both of these terms would be subject to misinterpretation by the modern English reader. The idea is one of turning back to God, however. The words &#8220;to me&#8221; are not in the Greek text, but are implied.</p>
