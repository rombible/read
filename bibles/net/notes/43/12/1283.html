<A NAME="1283"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">83</span><note=1299><b>sn</b> The author explicitly states here that Jesus&#8217; Jewish opponents <i>could not believe</i>, and quotes Isa 6:10 to show that God had in fact <i>blinded their eyes and hardened their heart</i>. This OT passage was used elsewhere in the NT to explain Jewish unbelief: Paul&#8217;s final words in Acts (28:26-27) are a quotation of this same passage, which he uses to explain why the Jewish people have not accepted the gospel he has preached. A similar passage (Isa 29:10) is quoted in a similar context in Rom 11:8.</p>
