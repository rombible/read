<A NAME="1291"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">91</span><note=1307><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;Jesus to be the Christ&#8221; are not in the Greek text, but are implied (see 9:22). As is often the case in Greek, the direct object is omitted for the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8033;&#956;&#959;&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#965;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jwmologoun</font>). Some translators supply an ambiguous &#8220;it,&#8221; or derive the implied direct object from the previous clause &#8220;believed in him&#8221; so that the rulers would not confess &#8220;their faith&#8221; or &#8220;their belief.&#8221; However, when one compares John 9:22, which has many verbal parallels to this verse, it seems clear that the content of the confession would have been &#8220;Jesus is the Christ (i.e., Messiah).&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> See the note on <i>Christ</i> in 1:20.</p>
