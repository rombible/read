<A NAME="1281"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">81</span><note=1297><b>tn</b> &#8220;The arm of the Lord&#8221; is an idiom for &#8220;God&#8217;s great power&#8221; (as exemplified through Jesus&#8217; miraculous signs). This response of unbelief is interpreted by the author as a fulfillment of the prophetic words of Isaiah (Isa 53:1). The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#946;&#961;&#945;&#967;&#943;&#969;&#957; &#954;&#965;&#961;&#943;&#959;&#965;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jo braciwn kuriou</font>) is a figurative reference to God&#8217;s activity and power which has been revealed in the sign-miracles which Jesus has performed (compare the previous verse).</p>
