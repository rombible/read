<A NAME="1214"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1230><b>sn</b><i> </i>This is a parenthetical note by the author. This is one of the indications in the gospels that Judas was of bad character <i>before</i> the betrayal of Jesus. John states that he was a <i>thief</i> and had responsibility for the finances of the group. More than being simply a derogatory note about Judas&#8217; character, the inclusion of the note at this particular point in the narrative may be intended to link the frustrated greed of Judas here with his subsequent decision to betray Jesus for money. The parallel accounts in Matthew and Mark seem to indicate that after this incident Judas went away immediately and made his deal with the Jewish authorities to deliver up Jesus. Losing out on one source of sordid gain, he immediately went out and set up another.</p>
