<A NAME="1215"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1231><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Leave her alone, that for the day of my burial she may keep it.&#8221; The construction with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jina</font>) is somewhat ambiguous. The simplest way to read it would be, &#8220;Leave her alone, that she may keep it for the day of my burial.&#8221; This would imply that Mary was going to use the perfumed oil on that day, while vv. 3 and 5 seem to indicate clearly that she had already used it up. Some understand the statement as elliptical: &#8220;Leave her alone; (she did this) in order to keep it for the day of my burial.&#8221; Another alternative would be an imperatival use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</font> with the meaning: &#8220;Leave her alone; let her keep it.&#8221; The reading of the Byzantine text, which omits the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</font> and substitutes a perfect tense <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#949;&#964;&#8053;&#961;&#951;&#954;&#949;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">tethrhken</font>), while not likely to be original, probably comes close to the meaning of the text, and that has been followed in this translation.</p>
