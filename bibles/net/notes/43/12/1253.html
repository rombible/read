<A NAME="1253"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=1269><b>tn</b> As a third person imperative in Greek, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#954;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#965;&#952;&#949;&#943;&#964;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">akolouqeitw</font>) is usually translated &#8220;let him follow me.&#8221; This could be understood by the modern English reader as merely permissive, however (&#8220;he may follow me if he wishes&#8221;). In this context there is no permissive sense, but rather a command, so the translation &#8220;he must follow me&#8221; is preferred.</p>
