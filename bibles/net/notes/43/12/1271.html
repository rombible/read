<A NAME="1271"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">71</span><note=1287><b>tn</b> Probably an allusion to Ps 89:35-37. It is difficult to pinpoint the passage in the Mosaic law to which the crowd refers. The ones most often suggested are Ps 89:36-37, Ps 110:4, Isa 9:7, Ezek 37:25, and Dan 7:14. None of these passages are in the Pentateuch <i>per se</i>, but &#8220;law&#8221; could in common usage refer to the entire OT (compare Jesus&#8217; use in John 10:34). Of the passages mentioned, Ps 89:36-37 is the most likely candidate. This verse speaks of David&#8217;s &#8220;seed&#8221; remaining forever. Later in the same psalm, v. 51 speaks of the &#8220;anointed&#8221; (Messiah), and the psalm was interpreted messianically in both the NT (Acts 13:22, Rev 1:5, 3:14) and in the rabbinic literature (<i>Genesis Rabbah</i> 97).</p>
