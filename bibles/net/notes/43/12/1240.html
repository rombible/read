<A NAME="1240"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">40</span><note=1256><b>sn</b> These Greeks <i>approached Philip</i>, although it is not clear why they did so. Perhaps they identified with his Greek name (although a number of Jews from border areas had Hellenistic names at this period). By <i>see</i> it is clear they meant &#8220;speak with,&#8221; since anyone could &#8220;see&#8221; Jesus moving through the crowd. The author does not mention what they wanted to speak with Jesus about.</p>
