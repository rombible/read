<A NAME="128"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1224><b>sn</b> This is a parenthetical note by the author. With a note characteristic of someone who was there and remembered, the author adds that <i>the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfumed oil</i>. In the later rabbinic literature, <i>Ecclesiastes Rabbah</i> 7.1.1 states &#8220;The fragrance of good oil is diffused from the bedroom to the dining hall, but a good name is diffused from one end of the world to the other.&#8221; If such a saying was known in the 1st century, this might be the author&#8217;s way of indicating that Mary&#8217;s act of devotion would be spoken of throughout the entire world (compare the comment in Mark 14:9).</p>
