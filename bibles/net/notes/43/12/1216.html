<A NAME="1216"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1232><b>tc</b> A few isolated witnesses omit v. 8 (D sy<sup>s</sup>), part of v. 8 (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>75</sup>), or vv. 7-8 ({0250}). The latter two omissions are surely due to errors of sight, while the former can be attributed to D&#8217;s sometimes erratic behavior. The verse is secure in light of the overwhelming evidence on its behalf.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> In the Greek text of this clause, &#8220;me&#8221; is in emphatic position (the first word in the clause). To convey some impression of the emphasis, an exclamation point is used in the translation.</p>
