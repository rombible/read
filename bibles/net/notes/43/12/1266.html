This must be in principle rather than in immediate fact, since 1 John 5:19 states that the whole world (still) lies in the power of the evil one (a reference to Satan). In an absolute sense the reference is proleptic. The coming of Jesus&#8217; hour (his crucifixion, death, resurrection, and exaltation to the Father) marks the end of Satan&#8217;s domain and brings about his defeat, even though that defeat has not been ultimately worked out in history yet and awaits the consummation of the age.</p>
