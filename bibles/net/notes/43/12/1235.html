<A NAME="1235"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1251><b>sn</b> The comment <i>His disciples did not understand these things when they first happened </i>(a parenthetical note by the author) informs the reader that Jesus&#8217; disciples did not at first associate the prophecy from Zechariah with the events as they happened. This came with the later (postresurrection) insight which the Holy Spirit would provide after Jesus&#8217; resurrection and return to the Father. Note the similarity with John 2:22, which follows another allusion to a prophecy in Zechariah (14:21).</p>
