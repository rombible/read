It appears best to understand the &#8220;hour&#8221; as a period of time starting at the end of Jesus&#8217; public ministry and extending through the passion week, ending with Jesus&#8217; return to the Father through death, resurrection, and exaltation. The &#8220;hour&#8221; begins as soon as the first events occur which begin the process that leads to Jesus&#8217; death.</p>

<A NAME="177"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1668><b>tn</b> Using <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8021;&#964;&#951; &#948;&#941;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jauth de</font>) to introduce an explanation is typical Johannine style; it was used before in John 1:19, 3:19, and 15:12.</p>
<A NAME="178"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1669><b>sn</b> <i>This is eternal life. </i>The author here defines <i>eternal life</i> for the readers, although it is worked into the prayer in such a way that many interpreters do not regard it as another of the author&#8217;s parenthetical comments. It is not just unending life in the sense of prolonged duration. Rather it is a quality of life, with its quality derived from a relationship with God. Having eternal life is here defined as being in relationship with the Father, the one true God, and Jesus Christ whom the Father sent. <i>Christ </i>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Cristos</font>) is not characteristically attached to Jesus&#8217; name in John&#8217;s Gospel; it occurs elsewhere primarily as a title and is used with Jesus&#8217; name only in 1:17. But that is connected to its use here: The statement here in 17:3 enables us to correlate the statement made in 1:18 of the prologue, that Jesus has fully revealed what God is like, with Jesus&#8217; statement in 10:10 that he has come that people might have life, and have it abundantly. These two purposes are really one, according to 17:3, because (abundant) eternal life is defined as knowing (being in relationship with) the Father and the Son. The only way to gain this eternal life, that is, to obtain this knowledge of the Father, is through the Son (cf. 14:6). Although some have pointed to the use of <i>know </i>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#953;&#957;&#8061;&#963;&#954;&#969;</font>, <font face="Greektl">ginwskw</font>) here as evidence of Gnostic influence in the Fourth Gospel, there is a crucial difference: For John this knowledge is not intellectual, but relational. It involves being in relationship.</p>

<A NAME="1710"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1671><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;by finishing&#8221; or &#8220;by accomplishing.&#8221; Jesus now states that he has glorified the Father on earth by finishing (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#949;&#955;&#949;&#953;&#8061;&#963;&#945;&#962;</font> [<font face="Greektl">teleiwsas</font>] is best understood as an adverbial participle of means) the work which the Father had given him to do.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>By completing the work. </i>The idea of Jesus being sent into the world on a mission has been mentioned before, significantly in 3:17. It was even alluded to in the immediately preceding verse here (17:3). The completion of the &#8220;work&#8221; the Father had sent him to accomplish was mentioned by Jesus in 4:34 and 5:36. What is the nature of the &#8220;work&#8221; the Father has given the Son to accomplish? It involves the Son&#8217;s mission to be the Savior of the world, as 3:17 indicates. But this is accomplished specifically through Jesus&#8217; sacrificial death on the cross (a thought implied by the reference to the Father &#8220;giving&#8221; the Son in 3:16). It is not without significance that Jesus&#8217; last word from the cross is &#8220;<i>It is completed</i>&#8221; (19:30).</p>
<A NAME="1711"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1672><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the work that you gave to me so that I may do it.&#8221;</p>

Whatever else may be said, the statement in 17:5 strongly asserts the preexistence of Jesus Christ.</p>

If one understands the referent here to be the broader group of Jesus&#8217; followers that included both men and women, a translation like &#8220;to the people&#8221; should be used here instead.</p>

Jesus said that he had been <i>glorified</i> by his disciples, but in what sense was this true? Jesus had manifested his glory to them in all of the sign-miracles which he had performed, beginning with the miracle at the wedding feast in Cana (2:11). He could now say that he had <i>been glorified by them</i> in the light of what he had already said in vv. 7-8, that the disciples had come to know that he had come from the Father and been sent by the Father. He would, of course, be glorified by them further after the resurrection, as they carried on his ministry after his departure.</p>

He is described as &#8220;the devil&#8221; in 6:70. In 13:2 Satan put into Judas&#8217; heart the idea of betraying Jesus, and 13:27 Satan himself entered Judas. Immediately after this Judas left the company of Jesus and the other disciples and went out into the realm of darkness (13:30). Cf. 2 Thess 2:3, where this same Greek phrase (&#8220;the son of destruction&#8221;; see <b>tn</b> above) is used to describe the man through whom Satan acts to rebel against God in the last days.</p>
<A NAME="1742"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1703><b>sn</b> A possible allusion to Ps 41:9 or Prov 24:22 LXX. The exact passage is not specified here, but in John 13:18, Ps 41:9 is explicitly quoted by Jesus with reference to the traitor, suggesting that this is the passage to which Jesus refers here. The previous mention of Ps 41:9 in John 13:18 probably explains why the author felt no need for an explanatory parenthetical note here. It is also possible that the passage referred to here is Prov 24:22 LXX, where in the Greek text the phrase &#8220;son of destruction&#8221; appears.</p>

<A NAME="1749"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">49</span><note=1710><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;the evil one&#8221; is a reference to Satan. The genitive noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#960;&#959;&#957;&#951;&#961;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">tou ponhrou</font>) is ambiguous with regard to gender: It may represent the neuter <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8056; &#960;&#959;&#957;&#951;&#961;&#972;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">to ponhron</font>), &#8220;that which is evil,&#8221; or the masculine <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#960;&#959;&#957;&#951;&#961;&#972;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jo ponhro&quot;</font>), &#8220;the evil one,&#8221; i.e., Satan. In view of the frequent use of the masculine in 1 John 2:13-14, 3:12, and 5:18-19 it seems much more probable that the masculine is to be understood here, and that Jesus is praying for his disciples to be protected from Satan. Cf. BDAG 851 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#959;&#957;&#951;&#961;&#972;&#962;</font> 1.b.<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#946;</font> and 1.b.<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;</font>.</p>

This gives additional emphasis to the idea of the prepositional phrase, i.e., origin, source, or affiliation.</p>
<A NAME="1751"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=1712><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;just as I am not of the world.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1752"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=1713><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Consecrate them&#8221; or &#8220;Sanctify them.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The Greek word translated <i>set&#8230;apart</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7937;&#947;&#953;&#940;&#950;&#969;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Jagiazw</font>) is used here in its normal sense of being dedicated, consecrated, or set apart. The sphere in which the disciples are to be set apart is <i>in the truth</i>. In 3:21 the idea of &#8220;practicing&#8221; (<i>Grk</i> &#8220;doing&#8221;) the truth was introduced; in 8:32 Jesus told some of his hearers that if they continued in his word they would truly be his disciples, and would know the truth, and the truth would make them free. These disciples who are with Jesus now for the Farewell Discourse have continued in his word (except for Judas Iscariot, who has departed), and they do know the truth about who Jesus is and why he has come into the world (17:8). Thus Jesus can ask the Father to set them apart in this truth as he himself is set apart, so that they might carry on his mission in the world after his departure (note the following verse).</p>
<A NAME="1753"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=1714><b>sn</b> Jesus now compared the mission on which he was sending the disciples to his own mission <i>into the world</i>, on which he was sent by the Father. As the Father sent Jesus into the world (cf. 3:17), so Jesus now sends the disciples into the world to continue his mission after his departure. The nature of this prayer for the disciples as a consecratory prayer is now emerging: Jesus was setting them apart for the work he had called them to do. They were, in a sense, being commissioned.</p>
<A NAME="1754"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=1715><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;I sanctify.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> In what sense does Jesus refer to his own &#8216;sanctification&#8217; with the phrase <i>I set myself apart</i>? In 10:36 Jesus referred to himself as &#8220;the one whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world,&#8221; which seems to look at something already accomplished. Here, however, it is something he does on behalf of the disciples (<i>on their behalf</i>) and this suggests a reference to his impending death on the cross. There is in fact a Johannine wordplay here based on slightly different meanings for the Greek verb translated <i>set apart </i>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7937;&#947;&#953;&#940;&#950;&#969;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Jagiazw</font>). In the sense it was used in 10:36 of Jesus and in 17:17 and here to refer to the disciples, it means to set apart in the sense that prophets (cf. Jer 1:5) and priests (Exod 40:13, Lev 8:30, and 2 Chr 5:11) were consecrated (or set apart) to perform their tasks. But when Jesus speaks of setting himself apart (consecrating or dedicating himself) on behalf of the disciples here in 17:19 the meaning is closer to the consecration of a sacrificial animal (Deut 15:19). Jesus is &#8220;setting himself apart,&#8221; i.e., dedicating himself, to do the will of the Father, that is, to go to the cross on the disciples&#8217; behalf (and of course on behalf of their successors as well).</p>

The disciples whom Jesus is leaving behind will carry on his ministry and in doing so will see others come to trust in him. This will include not only Jewish Christians, but other Gentile Christians who are &#8220;not of this fold&#8221; (10:16), and thus Jesus&#8217; prayer for unity is especially appropriate in light of the probability that most of the readers of the Gospel are Gentiles (much as Paul stresses unity between Jewish and Gentile Christians in Eph 2:10-22).</p>

The translation uses the word &#8220;men&#8221; here rather than a more general term like &#8220;people&#8221; because the use of the aorist verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#947;&#957;&#969;&#963;&#945;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">egnwsan</font>) implies that Jesus is referring to the disciples present with him as he spoke these words (presumably all of them men in the historical context), rather than to those who are yet to believe because of their testimony (see John 17:20).</p>
