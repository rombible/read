<A NAME="1898"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">98</span><note=1825><b>sn</b> Many have seen in Pilate&#8217;s reply &#8220;<i>I am not a Jew, am I?</i>&#8221; the Roman contempt for the Jewish people. Some of that may indeed be present, but strictly speaking, all Pilate affirms is that he, as a Roman, has no firsthand knowledge of Jewish custom or belief. What he knows of Jesus must have come from the Jewish authorities. They are the ones (<i>your own people and your chief priests</i>) who have handed Jesus over to Pilate.</p>
