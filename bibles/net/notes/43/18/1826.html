<A NAME="1826"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1753><b>sn</b> The account of the attack on the <i>high priest&#8217;s slave</i> contains details which suggest eyewitness testimony. It is also mentioned in all three synoptic gospels, but only John records that the disciple involved was Peter, whose impulsive behavior has already been alluded to (John 13:37). Likewise only John gives the name of the victim, <i>Malchus</i>, who is described as <i>the high priest&#8217;s slave</i>. John and Mark (14:47) both use the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8032;&#964;&#940;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">wtarion</font>, a double diminutive) to describe what was cut off, and this may indicate only part of the right ear (for example, the earlobe).</p>
