<A NAME="1821"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1748><b>sn</b> A second time Jesus replied, &#8220;<i>I told you that I am he</i>,&#8221; identifying himself as the one they are seeking. Jesus also added, &#8220;<i>If you are looking for me, let these men go</i>.&#8221; Jesus successfully diverted attention from his disciples by getting the soldiers and officers of the chief priests to admit (twice) that it is only him they were after. Even in this hour Jesus still protected and cared for his own, giving himself up on their behalf. By handing himself over to his enemies, Jesus ensured that his disciples went free. From the perspective of the author, this is acting out beforehand what Jesus will actually do for his followers when he goes to the cross.</p>
