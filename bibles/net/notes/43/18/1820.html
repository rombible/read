<A NAME="1820"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">20</span><note=1747><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;men&#8221; is not in the Greek text but is implied. The translation uses the word &#8220;men&#8221; here rather than a more generic word like &#8220;people&#8221; because in context Jesus referred only to the eleven remaining disciples who were loyal to him and were present at his arrest.</p>
