<A NAME="1875"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">75</span><note=1802><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;to the praetorium.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The permanent <i>residence</i> of the <i>Roman governor</i> of Palestine was in Caesarea (Acts 23:35). The governor had a residence in Jerusalem which he normally occupied only during principal feasts or in times of political unrest. The location of this building in Jerusalem is uncertain, but is probably one of two locations: either (1) the fortress or tower of Antonia, on the east hill north of the temple area, which is the traditional location of the Roman praetorium since the 12th century, or (2) the palace of Herod on the west hill near the present Jaffa Gate. According to Philo (<i>Embassy </i>38 [299]) Pilate had some golden shields hung there, and according to Josephus (<i>J. W. </i>2.14.8 [2.301], 2.15.5 [2.328]) the later Roman governor Florus stayed there.</p>
