<A NAME="189"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1736><b>tn</b> These were lamps that had some sort of covering to protect them from wind and rain. In earlier usage the word meant &#8220;torch&#8221; but by NT times it apparently meant a lamp designed to be used outdoors, so &#8220;lantern&#8221; is a good contemporary English equivalent.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Mention of the <i>lanterns and torches</i> suggests a detail remembered by one who was an eyewitness, but in connection with the light/darkness motif of John&#8217;s Gospel, it is a vivid reminder that it is night; the darkness has come at last (cf. 13:30).</p>
