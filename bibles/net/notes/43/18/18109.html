<A NAME="18109"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">109</span><note=1836><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the Jewish authorities&#8221;; <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the Jews.&#8221; Here the phrase refers to the Jewish leaders, especially members of the Sanhedrin. See the note on the phrase &#8220;Jewish leaders&#8221; in v. 12. The term also occurs in v. 31, where it is clear the Jewish leaders are in view, because they state that they cannot legally carry out an execution. Although it is likely (in view of the synoptic parallels) that the crowd here in 18:38 was made up not just of the Jewish leaders, but of ordinary residents of Jerusalem and pilgrims who were in Jerusalem for the Passover, nevertheless in John&#8217;s Gospel Pilate is primarily in dialogue with the leadership of the nation, who are expressly mentioned in 18:35 and 19:6.</p>
