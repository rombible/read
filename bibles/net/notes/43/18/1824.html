<A NAME="1824"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1751><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Of the ones whom you gave me, I did not lose one of them.&#8221; The order of the clauses has been rearranged to reflect contemporary English style.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This action of Jesus on behalf of his disciples is interpreted by the author as a fulfillment of Jesus&#8217; own words: &#8220;<i>I have not lost a single one of those whom you gave me</i>.&#8221; Here it is Jesus&#8217; own words, rather than the OT scriptures, which are quoted. This same formula will be used by the author again of Jesus&#8217; words in 18:32, but the verb is used elsewhere in the Fourth Gospel to describe the NT fulfillment of OT passages (12:38, 13:18, 15:25, 17:12, 19:24, and 19:36). It is a bit difficult to determine the exact referent, since the words of Jesus quoted in this verse are not an exact reproduction of a saying of Jesus elsewhere in John&#8217;s Gospel. Although some have identified the saying with John 6:39, the closest parallel is in 17:12, where the betrayer, Judas, is specifically excluded. The words quoted here in 18:9 appear to be a free rendition of 17:12.</p>
