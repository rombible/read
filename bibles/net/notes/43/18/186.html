<A NAME="186"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1733><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;a cohort.&#8221; The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#960;&#949;&#8150;&#961;&#945;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">speiran</font>) is a technical term for a Roman cohort, normally a force of 600 men (one tenth of a legion). It was under the command of a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#967;&#953;&#955;&#943;&#945;&#961;&#967;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ciliarco&quot;</font>, v. 12). Because of the improbability of an entire cohort being sent to arrest a single man, some have suggested that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#960;&#949;&#8150;&#961;&#945;&#957;</font> here refers only to a maniple, a force of 200. But the use of the word here does not necessarily mean the entire cohort was present on this mission, but only that it was the cohort which performed the task (for example, saying the fire department put out the fire does not mean that every fireman belonging to the department was on the scene at the time). These Roman soldiers must have been ordered to accompany the servants of the chief priests and Pharisees by Pilate, since they would have been under the direct command of the Roman prefect or procurator. It is not difficult to understand why Pilate would have been willing to assist the Jewish authorities in such a way. With a huge crowd of pilgrims in Jerusalem for the Passover, the Romans would have been especially nervous about an uprising of some sort. No doubt the chief priests and Pharisees had informed Pilate that this man Jesus was claiming to be the Messiah, or in the terms Pilate would understand, king of Israel.</p>
