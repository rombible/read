<A NAME="1895"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">95</span><note=1822><b>sn</b> It is difficult to discern Pilate&#8217;s attitude when he asked, &#8220;<i>Are you the king of the Jews?</i>&#8221; Some have believed the remark to be sarcastic or incredulous as Pilate looked at this lowly and humble prisoner: &#8220;So <i>you</i>&#8217;<i>re</i> the king of the Jews, are you?&#8221; Others have thought the Roman governor to have been impressed by Jesus&#8217; regal disposition and dignity, and to have sincerely asked, &#8220;Are you <i>really</i> the king of the Jews?&#8221; Since it will later become apparent (v. 38) that Pilate considered Jesus innocent (and therefore probably also harmless) an attitude of incredulity is perhaps most likely, but this is far from certain in the absence of clear contextual clues.</p>
