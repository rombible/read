<A NAME="187"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1734><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;officers of the chief priests and Pharisees&#8221; is a comprehensive name for the groups represented in the ruling council (the Sanhedrin) as in John 7:32, 45; 18:3, 12, 18, 22; 19:6. They are different from the Levites who served as &#8220;temple police&#8221; according to K. H. Rengstorf (<i>TDNT</i> 8:540). In John 7:32ff. these officers had made an unsuccessful attempt to arrest Jesus, and perhaps this is part of the reason why their leaders had made sure they were accompanied by Roman soldiers this time. No more mistakes were to be tolerated.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> See the note on <i>Pharisees</i> in 1:24.</p>
