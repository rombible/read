<A NAME="181"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1728><b>sn</b> <i>When he had said these things</i> appears to be a natural transition at the end of the Farewell Discourse (the farewell speech of Jesus to his disciples in John 13:31-17:26, including the final prayer in 17:1-26). The author states that Jesus <i>went out with his disciples</i>, a probable reference to their leaving the upper room where the meal and discourse described in chaps. 13-17 took place (although some have seen this only as a reference to their leaving the city, with the understanding that some of the Farewell Discourse, including the concluding prayer, was given <i>en route</i>, cf. 14:31). They crossed the Kidron Valley and came to a garden, or olive orchard, identified in Matt 26:36 and Mark 14:32 as Gethsemane. The name is not given in Luke&#8217;s or John&#8217;s Gospel, but the garden must have been located somewhere on the lower slopes of the Mount of Olives.</p>
