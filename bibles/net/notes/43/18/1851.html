<A NAME="1851"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=1778><b>sn</b> The nature of this hearing seems to be more that of a preliminary investigation; certainly normal legal procedure was not followed, for no indication is given that any witnesses were brought forth at this point to testify against Jesus. True to what is known of Annas&#8217; character, he was more interested in Jesus&#8217; <i>disciples</i> than in the precise nature of Jesus&#8217; <i>teaching</i>, since he inquired about the followers first. He really wanted to know just how influential Jesus had become and how large a following he had gathered. This was of more concern to Annas that the truth or falsity of Jesus&#8217; teaching.</p>
