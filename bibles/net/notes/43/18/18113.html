<A NAME="18113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">113</span><note=1840><b>sn</b> Pilate then offered to release Jesus, reminding the Jewish authorities that they had a custom that he <i>release one prisoner</i> for them at the Passover. There is no extra-biblical evidence alluding to the practice. It is, however, mentioned in Matthew and Mark, described either as a practice of Pilate (Mark 15:6) or of the Roman governor (Matt 27:15). These references may explain the lack of extra-biblical attestation: The custom to which Pilate refers here (18:39) is not a permanent one acknowledged by all the Roman governors, but one peculiar to Pilate as a means of appeasement, meant to better relations with his subjects. Such a limited meaning is certainly possible and consistent with the statement here. </p>
