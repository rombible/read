<A NAME="1866"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=1793><b>sn</b> Where was <i>Caiaphas the high priest</i> located? Did he have a separate palace, or was he somewhere else with the Sanhedrin? Since Augustine (4th century) a number of scholars have proposed that Annas and Caiaphas resided in different wings of the same palace, which were bound together by a common courtyard through which Jesus would have been led as he was taken from Annas to Caiaphas. This seems a reasonable explanation, although there is no conclusive evidence.</p>
