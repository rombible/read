<A NAME="18116"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">116</span><note=1843><b>sn</b> The name <i>Barabbas</i> in Aramaic means &#8220;son of abba,&#8221; that is, &#8220;son of the father,&#8221; and presumably the man in question had another name (it may also have been Jesus, according to the textual variant in Matt 27:16, although this is uncertain). For the author this name held ironic significance: The crowd was asking for the release of a man called Barabbas, &#8220;son of the father,&#8221; while Jesus, who was truly the Son of the Father, was condemned to die instead.</p>
