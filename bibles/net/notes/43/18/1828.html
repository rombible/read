In connection with the synoptic accounts it is mentioned in Jesus&#8217; prayer; this occurrence certainly complements the synoptic accounts if Jesus had only shortly before finished praying about this. Only here in the Fourth Gospel is it specifically said that the cup is given to Jesus to drink by the Father, but again this is consistent with the synoptic mention of the cup in Jesus&#8217; prayer: It is the cup of suffering which Jesus is about to undergo.</p>
