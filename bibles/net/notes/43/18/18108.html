<A NAME="18108"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">108</span><note=1835><b>sn</b> With his reply &#8220;<i>What is truth?</i>&#8221; Pilate dismissed the matter. It is not clear what Pilate&#8217;s attitude was at this point, as in 18:33. He may have been sarcastic, or perhaps somewhat reflective. The author has not given enough information in the narrative to be sure. Within the narrative, Pilate&#8217;s question serves to make the reader reflect on what <i>truth</i> is, and that answer (in the narrative) has already been given (14:6).</p>
