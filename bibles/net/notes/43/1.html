It was attended by the related question of &#8220;What is the process by which the secondary things came out of the primary one (or ones)?,&#8221; or in Aristotelian terminology, &#8220;What is the &#8216;beginning&#8217; (same Greek word as <i>beginning</i>, John 1:1) and what is the origin of the things that are made?&#8221; In the New Testament the word usually has a temporal sense, but even BDAG 138 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8053;</font> 3 lists a major category of meaning as &#8220;the first cause.&#8221; For John, the words &#8220;In the beginning&#8221; are most likely a conscious allusion to the opening words of Genesis &#8211; &#8220;In the beginning.&#8221; Other concepts which occur prominently in Gen 1 are also found in John&#8217;s prologue: &#8220;life&#8221; (1:4) &#8220;light&#8221; (1:4) and &#8220;darkness&#8221; (1:5). Gen 1 describes the first (physical) creation; John 1 describes the new (spiritual) creation. But this is not to play off a false dichotomy between &#8220;physical&#8221; and &#8220;spiritual&#8221;; the first creation was both physical and spiritual. The new creation is really a re-creation, of the spiritual (first) but also the physical. (In spite of the common understanding of John&#8217;s &#8220;spiritual&#8221; emphasis, the &#8220;physical&#8221; re-creation should not be overlooked; this occurs in John 2 with the changing of water into wine, in John 11 with the resurrection of Lazarus, and the emphasis of John 20-21 on the aftermath of Jesus&#8217; own resurrection.)</p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=2><b>tn</b> The preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#972;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pros</font>) implies not just proximity, but intimate personal relationship. M. Dods stated, &#8220;<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#928;&#961;&#972;&#962;</font> &#8230;means more than <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#949;&#964;&#940;</font> or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#940;</font>, and is regularly employed in expressing the presence of one person with another&#8221; (&#8220;The Gospel of St. John,&#8221; <i>The Expositor</i>&#8217;<i>s Greek Testament</i>, 1:684). See also Mark 6:3, Matt 13:56, Mark 9:19, Gal 1:18, 2 John 12.</p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=3><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;and what God was the Word was.&#8221; Colwell&#8217;s Rule is often invoked to support the translation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">qeos</font>) as definite (&#8220;God&#8221;) rather than indefinite (&#8220;a god&#8221;) here. However, Colwell&#8217;s Rule merely <i>permits</i>, but does not demand, that a predicate nominative ahead of an equative verb be translated as definite rather than indefinite. Furthermore, Colwell&#8217;s Rule did not deal with a third possibility, that the anarthrous predicate noun may have more of a qualitative nuance when placed ahead of the verb. A definite meaning for the term is reflected in the traditional rendering &#8220;the word was God.&#8221; From a technical standpoint, though, it is preferable to see a qualitative aspect to anarthrous <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font> in John 1:1c (<i>ExSyn</i> 266-69). Translations like the NEB, REB, and Moffatt are helpful in capturing the sense in John 1:1c, that the Word was fully deity in essence (just as much God as God the Father). However, in contemporary English &#8220;the Word was divine&#8221; (Moffatt) does not quite catch the meaning since &#8220;divine&#8221; as a descriptive term is not used in contemporary English exclusively of God. The translation &#8220;what God was the Word was&#8221; is perhaps the most nuanced rendering, conveying that everything God was in essence, the Word was too. This points to unity of essence between the Father and the Son without equating the persons. However, in surveying a number of native speakers of English, some of whom had formal theological training and some of whom did not, the editors concluded that the fine distinctions indicated by &#8220;what God was the Word was&#8221; would not be understood by many contemporary readers. Thus the translation &#8220;the Word was fully God&#8221; was chosen because it is more likely to convey the meaning to the average English reader that the <font face="Greektl">Logos</font> (which &#8220;became flesh and took up residence among us&#8221; in John 1:14 and is thereafter identified in the Fourth Gospel as Jesus) is one in essence with God the Father. The previous phrase, &#8220;the Word was with God,&#8221; shows that the <font face="Greektl">Logos</font> is distinct in person from God the Father.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>And the Word was fully God.</i> John&#8217;s theology consistently drives toward the conclusion that Jesus, the incarnate Word, is just as much God as God the Father. This can be seen, for example, in texts like John 10:30 (&#8220;The Father and I are one&#8221;), 17:11 (&#8220;so that they may be one just as we are one&#8221;), and 8:58 (&#8220;before Abraham came into existence, I am&#8221;). The construction in John 1:1c does not equate the Word with the <i>person</i> of God (this is ruled out by 1:1b, &#8220;the Word was with God&#8221;); rather it affirms that the Word and God are one in <i>essence</i>.</p>

<a name="17"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=7><b>tc</b> There is a major punctuation problem here: Should this relative clause go with v. 3 or v. 4? The earliest <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> have no punctuation (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>66,75*</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* A B <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#916;</font> <i>al</i>). Many of the later <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> which do have punctuation place it before the phrase, thus putting it with v. 4 (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>75c</sup> C D L W<sup>s</sup> 050* <i>pc</i>). NA<sup>25</sup> placed the phrase in v. 3; NA<sup>26</sup> moved the words to the beginning of v. 4. In a detailed article K. Aland defended the change (&#8220;Eine Untersuchung zu Johannes 1, 3-4. Über die Bedeutung eines Punktes,&#8221; <i>ZNW </i>59 [1968]: 174-209). He sought to prove that the attribution of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8003; &#947;&#941;&#947;&#959;&#957;&#949;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">}o gegonen</font>) to v. 3 began to be carried out in the 4th century in the Greek church. This came out of the Arian controversy, and was intended as a safeguard for doctrine. The change was unknown in the West. Aland is probably correct in affirming that the phrase was attached to v. 4 by the Gnostics and the Eastern Church; only when the Arians began to use the phrase was it attached to v. 3. But this does not rule out the possibility that, by moving the words from v. 4 to v. 3, one is restoring the original reading. Understanding the words as part of v. 3 is natural and adds to the emphasis which is built up there, while it also gives a terse, forceful statement in v. 4. On the other hand, taking the phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8003; &#947;&#941;&#947;&#959;&#957;&#949;&#957;</font> with v. 4 gives a complicated expression: C. K. Barrett says that both ways of understanding v. 4 with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8003; &#947;&#941;&#947;&#959;&#957;&#949;&#957;</font> included &#8220;are almost impossibly clumsy&#8221; (<i>St. John</i>, 157): &#8220;That which came into being &#8211; in it the Word was life&#8221;; &#8220;That which came into being &#8211; in the Word was its life.&#8221; The following stylistic points should be noted in the solution of this problem: (1) John frequently starts sentences with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">en</font>); (2) he repeats frequently (&#8220;nothing was created that has been created&#8221;); (3) 5:26 and 6:53 both give a sense similar to v. 4 if it is understood without the phrase; (4) it makes far better Johannine sense to say that in the Word was life than to say that the created universe (what was made, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8003; &#947;&#941;&#947;&#959;&#957;&#949;&#957;</font>) was life in him. In conclusion, the phrase is best taken with v. 3. Schnackenburg, Barrett, Carson, Haenchen, Morris, KJV, and NIV concur (against Brown, Beasley-Murray, and NEB). The arguments of R. Schnackenburg, <i>St. John</i>, 1:239-40, are particularly persuasive.</p><p class="footnote"><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;made&#8221;; <i>Grk</i> &#8220;that has come into existence.&#8221; </p>

The two uses in 1:4, if they do not refer to &#8220;eternal&#8221; life, would be the only exceptions. (Also 1 John uses <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#950;&#969;&#8053;</font> 13 times, always of &#8220;eternal&#8221; life.)</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> An allusion to Ps 36:9, which gives significant OT background: &#8220;For with you is the fountain of life; In your light we see light.&#8221; In later Judaism, Bar 4:2 expresses a similar idea. Life, especially eternal life, will become one of the major themes of John&#8217;s Gospel.</p>

<a name="110"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=10><b>tn</b> To this point the author has used past tenses (imperfects, aorists); now he switches to a present. The light continually shines (thus the translation, &#8220;shines on&#8221;). Even as the author writes, it is shining. The present here most likely has gnomic force (though it is possible to take it as a historical present); it expresses the timeless truth that the light of the world (cf. 8:12, 9:5, 12:46) never ceases to shine.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>The light shines on. </i>The question of whether John has in mind here the preincarnate Christ or the incarnate Christ is probably too specific. The incarnation is not really introduced until v. 9, but here the point is more general: It is of the very nature of <i>light</i>, that it <i>shines</i>.</p>
<a name="111"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=11><b>sn</b> The author now introduces what will become a major theme of John&#8217;s Gospel: the opposition of <i>light</i> and <i>darkness</i>. The antithesis is a natural one, widespread in antiquity. Gen 1 gives considerable emphasis to it in the account of the creation, and so do the writings of Qumran. It is the major theme of one of the most important extra-biblical documents found at Qumran, the so-called War Scroll, properly titled <i>The War of the Sons of Light with the Sons of Darkness</i>. Connections between John and Qumran are still an area of scholarly debate and a consensus has not yet emerged. See T. A. Hoffman, &#8220;1 John and the Qumran Scrolls,&#8221; <i>BTB </i>8 (1978): 117-25.</p>

<a name="113"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=13><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;comprehended it,&#8221; or &#8220;overcome it.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#941;&#955;&#945;&#946;&#949;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">katelaben</font>) is not easy to translate. &#8220;To seize&#8221; or &#8220;to grasp&#8221; is possible, but this also permits &#8220;to grasp with the mind&#8221; in the sense of &#8220;to comprehend&#8221; (esp. in the middle voice). This is probably another Johannine double meaning &#8211; one does not usually think of darkness as trying to &#8220;understand&#8221; light. For it to mean this, &#8220;darkness&#8221; must be understood as meaning &#8220;certain people,&#8221; or perhaps &#8220;humanity&#8221; at large, darkened in understanding. But in John&#8217;s usage, darkness is not normally used of people or a group of people. Rather it usually signifies the evil environment or &#8216;sphere&#8217; in which people find themselves: &#8220;They loved darkness rather than light&#8221; (John 3:19). Those who follow Jesus do not walk in darkness (8:12). They are to walk while they have light, lest the darkness &#8220;overtake/overcome&#8221; them (12:35, same verb as here). For John, with his set of symbols and imagery, darkness is not something which seeks to &#8220;understand (comprehend)&#8221; the light, but represents the forces of evil which seek to &#8220;overcome (conquer)&#8221; it. The English verb &#8220;to master&#8221; may be used in both sorts of contexts, as &#8220;he mastered his lesson&#8221; and &#8220;he mastered his opponent.&#8221;</p>

Option (1) results in a periphrastic imperfect with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7974;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">hn</font>), <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7974;&#957; &#964;&#8056; &#966;&#8182;&#962;&#8230; &#7952;&#961;&#967;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957;</font>, referring to the incarnation. Option (2) would have the participle modifying <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#957;</font> and referring to the true light as enlightening &#8220;every man who comes into the world.&#8221; Option (2) has some rabbinic parallels: The phrase &#8220;all who come into the world&#8221; is a fairly common expression for &#8220;every man&#8221; (cf. <i>Leviticus</i> <i>Rabbah</i> 31.6). But (1) must be preferred here, because: (a) In the next verse the light is in the world; it is logical for v. 9 to speak of its entering the world; (b) in other passages Jesus is described as &#8220;coming into the world&#8221; (6:14, 9:39, 11:27, 16:28) and in 12:46 Jesus says: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#947;&#8060; &#966;&#8182;&#962; &#949;&#7984;&#962; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#954;&#972;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#957; &#7952;&#955;&#8053;&#955;&#965;&#952;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">egw fw&quot; ei&quot; ton kosmon elhluqa</font>); (c) use of a periphrastic participle with the imperfect tense is typical Johannine style: 1:28, 2:6, 3:23, 10:40, 11:1, 13:23, 18:18 and 25. In every one of these except 13:23 the finite verb is first and separated by one or more intervening words from the participle.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> In v. 9 the <i>world</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#972;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">kosmos</font>) is mentioned for the first time. This is another important theme word for John. Generally, <i>the world</i> as a Johannine concept does not refer to the totality of creation (the universe), although there are exceptions at 11:9. 17:5, 24, 21:25, but to the world of human beings and human affairs. Even in 1:10 the world created through the <i>Logos</i> is a world capable of knowing (or reprehensibly not knowing) its Creator. Sometimes <i>the world</i> is further qualified as <i>this world</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#954;&#972;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#962; &#959;&#8023;&#964;&#959;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Jo kosmos Joutos</font>) as in 8:23, 9:39, 11:9, 12:25, 31; 13:1, 16:11, 18:36. This is not merely equivalent to the rabbinic phrase &#8220;this present age&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#945;&#7984;&#8061;&#957; &#959;&#8023;&#964;&#959;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Jo aiwn Joutos</font>) and contrasted with &#8220;the world to come.&#8221; For John it is also contrasted to a world other than this one, already existing; this is the lower world, corresponding to which there is a world above (see especially 8:23, 18:36). Jesus appears not only as the Messiah by means of whom an eschatological future is anticipated (as in the synoptic gospels) but also as an envoy from the heavenly world to <i>this world</i>.</p>

One of the unsolved mysteries is why the corresponding noun form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pistis</font>) is never used at all. Many have held the noun was in use in some pre-Gnostic sects and this rendered it suspect for John. It might also be that for John, faith was an activity, something that men do (cf. W. Turner, &#8220;Believing and Everlasting Life &#8211; A Johannine Inquiry,&#8221; <i>ExpTim </i>64 [1952/53]: 50-52). John uses <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#969;</font> in 4 major ways: (1) of believing facts, reports, etc., 12 times; (2) of believing people (or the scriptures), 19 times; (3) of believing &#8220;in&#8221; Christ&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#969;</font> + <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#962;</font> + acc.), 36 times; (4) used absolutely without any person or object specified, 30 times (the one remaining passage is 2:24, where Jesus refused to &#8220;trust&#8221; himself to certain individuals). Of these, the most significant is the use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#969;</font> with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#962;</font> + accusative. It is not unlike the Pauline <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8183;</font> (<font face="Greektl">en Cristw</font>) formula. Some have argued that this points to a Hebrew (more likely Aramaic) original behind the Fourth Gospel. But it probably indicates something else, as C. H. Dodd observed: &#8220;<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#949;&#953;&#957;</font> with the dative so inevitably connoted simple credence, in the sense of an intellectual judgment, that the moral element of personal trust or reliance inherent in the Hebrew or Aramaic phrase &#8211; an element integral to the primitive Christian conception of faith in Christ &#8211; needed to be otherwise expressed&#8221; (<i>The Interpretation of the Fourth Gospel</i>, 183).</p>

At least some sources in antiquity imply that blood was thought of as being important in the development of the fetus during its time in the womb: thus Wis 7:1: &#8220;in the womb of a mother I was molded into flesh, within the period of 10 months, compacted with blood, from the seed of a man and the pleasure of marriage.&#8221; In John 1:13, the plural <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#7985;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957;</font> may imply the action of both parents. It may also refer to the &#8220;genetic&#8221; contribution of both parents, and so be equivalent to &#8220;human descent&#8221; (see BDAG 26 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#7991;&#956;&#945;</font> 1.a). E. C. Hoskyns thinks John could not have used the singular here because Christians are in fact &#8216;begotten&#8217; by the blood of Christ (<i>The Fourth Gospel</i>, 143), although the context would seem to make it clear that the blood in question is something other than the blood of Christ.</p>

The author is suggesting that this glory can now be seen in Jesus (note the following verse).<i> </i>The verb used here may imply that the Shekinah glory that once was found in the tabernacle has taken up residence in the person of Jesus. Cf. also John 2:19-21. <i>The Word became flesh. </i>This verse constitutes the most concise statement of the incarnation in the New Testament. John 1:1 makes it clear that the <i>Logos</i> was fully God, but 1:14 makes it clear that he was also fully human. A Docetic interpretation is completely ruled out. Here for the first time the <i>Logos</i> of 1:1 is identified as Jesus of Nazareth &#8211; the two are one and the same. Thus this is the last time the word <i>logos</i> is used in the Fourth Gospel to refer to the second person of the Trinity.

The word in Greek was used of an only child (a son [Luke 7:12, 9:38] or a daughter [Luke 8:42]). It was also used of something unique (only one of its kind) such as the mythological Phoenix (<i>1 Clem</i>. 25:2). From here it passes easily to a description of Isaac (Heb 11:17 and Josephus, <i>Ant.</i>, 1.13.1 [1.222]) who was not Abraham&#8217;s <i>only</i> son, but was one-of-a-kind because he was the child of the promise. Thus the word means &#8220;one-of-a-kind&#8221; and is reserved for Jesus in the Johannine literature of the NT. While all Christians are children of God, Jesus is God&#8217;s Son in a unique, one-of-a-kind sense. The word is used in this way in all its uses in the Gospel of John (1:14, 1:18, 3:16, and 3:18).</p>

The most commonly held view is (2) in one sense or another, and this is probably the best explanation. This sense is supported by a fairly well-known use in Philo, <i>Posterity </i>43 (145). Morna D.

John 3:16, 18; 1 John 4:9). But <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font> as the older and more difficult reading is preferred.

(B. D. Ehrman, <i>The Orthodox Corruption of Scripture</i>, 81, suggests that it is nearly impossible and completely unattested in the NT for an adjective followed immediately by a noun that agrees in gender, number, and case, to be a substantival adjective: &#8220;when is an adjective <i>ever</i> used substantivally when it immediately precedes a noun of the same inflection?&#8221; This, however, is an overstatement. First, as Ehrman admits, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#8053;&#962;</font> in John 1:14 is substantival. And since it is an established usage for the adjective in this context, one might well expect that the author would continue to use the adjective substantivally four verses later. Indeed, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#8053;&#962;</font> is already moving toward a crystallized substantival adjective in the NT [cf. Luke 9:38; Heb 11:17]; in patristic Greek, the process continued [cf. <i>PGL</i> 881 s.v. 7]. Second, there are several instances in the NT in which a <i>substantival</i> adjective is followed by a noun with which it has complete concord: cf., e.g., Rom 1:30; Gal 3:9; 1 Tim 1:9; 2 Pet 2:5.) The modern translations which best express this are the NEB (margin) and TEV. Several things should be noted: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#8053;&#962;</font> alone, without <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#965;&#7985;&#972;&#962;</font>, can mean &#8220;only son,&#8221; &#8220;unique son,&#8221; &#8220;unique one,&#8221; etc. (see 1:14). Furthermore, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font> is anarthrous. As such it carries qualitative force much like it does in 1:1c, where <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#8056;&#962; &#7974;&#957; &#8001; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">qeo&quot; hn Jo logo&quot;</font>) means &#8220;the Word was fully God&#8221; or &#8220;the Word was fully of the essence of deity.&#8221; Finally, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#8036;&#957;</font> occurs in Rev 1:4, 8; 4:8, 11:17; and 16:5, but even more significantly in the LXX of Exod 3:14.

A majority expected the Messiah. But some pseudepigraphic books describe God&#8217;s intervention without mentioning the anointed Davidic king; in parts of <i>1 Enoch</i>, for example, the figure of the Son of Man, not the Messiah, embodies the expectations of the author. Essenes at Qumran seem to have expected three figures: a prophet, a priestly messiah, and a royal messiah. In baptizing, John the Baptist was performing an eschatological action. It also seems to have been part of his proclamation (John 1:23, 26-27). Crowds were beginning to follow him. He was operating in an area not too far from the Essene center on the Dead Sea. No wonder the authorities were curious about who he was.</p>

Concerning the <i>Christ</i>, the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#967;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">cristos</font>) was originally an adjective (&#8220;anointed&#8221;), developing in LXX into a substantive (&#8220;an anointed one&#8221;), then developing still further into a technical generic term (&#8220;the anointed one&#8221;). In the intertestamental period it developed further into a technical term referring to the hoped-for anointed one, that is, a specific individual. In the NT the development starts there (technical-specific), is so used in the gospels, and then develops in Paul to mean virtually Jesus&#8217; last name.</p>

<a name="159"></a><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">59</span><note=59><b>sn</b> According to the 1st century rabbinic interpretation of 2 Kgs 2:11, <i>Elijah</i> was still alive. In Mal 4:5 it is said that Elijah would be the precursor of Messiah. How does one reconcile John the Baptist&#8217;s denial here (<i>&#8220;I am not&#8221;</i>) with Jesus&#8217; statements in Matt 11:14 (see also Mark 9:13 and Matt 17:12) that John the Baptist <i>was</i> Elijah? Some have attempted to remove the difficulty by a reconstruction of the text in the Gospel of John which makes the Baptist say that he was Elijah. However, external support for such emendations is lacking. According to Gregory the Great, John was <i>not</i> Elijah, but exercised toward Jesus the <i>function</i> of Elijah by preparing his way. But this avoids the real difficulty, since in John&#8217;s Gospel the question of the Jewish authorities to the Baptist concerns <i>precisely</i> his function. It has also been suggested that the author of the Gospel here preserves a historically correct reminiscence &#8211; that John the Baptist did not think of himself as Elijah, although Jesus said otherwise. Mark 6:14-16 and Mark 8:28 indicate the people and Herod both distinguished between John and Elijah &#8211; <i>probably</i> because he did not see himself as Elijah. But Jesus&#8217; remarks in Matt 11:14, Mark 9:13, and Matt 17:12 indicate that John <i>did</i> perform the function of Elijah &#8211; John did for Jesus what Elijah was to have done for the coming of the Lord. C. F. D. Moule pointed out that it is too simple to see a straight contradiction between John&#8217;s account and that of the synoptic gospels: &#8220;We have to ask <i>by whom</i> the identification is made, and by whom refused. The synoptic gospels represent <i>Jesus</i> as identifying, or comparing, the Baptist with Elijah, while John represents the <i>Baptist</i> as rejecting the identification when it is offered him by his interviewers. Now these two, so far from being incompatible, are psychologically complementary. The Baptist humbly rejects the exalted title, but Jesus, on the contrary, bestows it on him. Why should not the two both be correct?&#8221; (<i>The Phenomenon of the New Testament </i>[SBT], 70).</p>

On the other hand, both since Origen&#8217;s understanding of the Semitic etymology of Bethabara was incorrect, and because Bethany was at least a well-known location in Palestine, mentioned in the Gospels about a dozen times, one has to wonder whether scribes replaced <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#914;&#951;&#952;&#945;&#946;&#945;&#961;&#8119; </font>with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#914;&#951;&#952;&#945;&#957;&#943;&#8115;</font>.

The general significance of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#941;&#957;&#969;</font> for John is to express the permanency of relationship between Father and Son and Son and believer.

Other notes on the dispensation of the Spirit occur at John 3:5 and following (at least implied by the wordplay), John 3:34, 7:38-39, numerous passages in John 14-16 (the Paraclete passages) and John 20:22.

On the other hand, one of the earliest <span class="smallcaps">mss</span> for this verse, {<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>5</sup>} (3rd century), evidently read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8023;&#964;&#972;&#962; &#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; &#8001; &#7952;&#954;&#955;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font>.

A third reading combines these two: &#8220;the elect Son&#8221; (<i>electus filius</i> in ff<sup>2c</sup> sa and a [with slight variation]). Although the evidence for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954;&#955;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font> is not as impressive as that for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#965;&#7985;&#972;&#962;</font>, the reading is found in early Alexandrian and Western witnesses. Turning to the internal evidence, &#8220;the Chosen One&#8221; clearly comes out ahead. &#8220;Son of God&#8221; is a favorite expression of the author (cf. 1:49; 3:18; 5:25; 10:36; 11:4, 27; 19:7; 20:31); further, there are several other references to &#8220;his Son,&#8221; &#8220;the Son,&#8221; etc. Scribes would be naturally motivated to change <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954;&#955;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font> to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#965;&#7985;&#972;&#962;</font> since the latter is both a Johannine expression and is, on the surface, richer theologically in 1:34. On the other hand, there is not a sufficient reason for scribes to change <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#965;&#7985;&#972;&#962;</font> to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954;&#955;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font>. The term never occurs in John; even its verbal cognate (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954;&#955;&#941;&#947;&#969;</font>, <font face="Greektl">eklegw</font>) is never affirmed of Jesus in this Gospel. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#954;&#955;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font> clearly best explains the rise of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#965;&#7985;&#972;&#962;</font>. Further, the third reading (&#8220;Chosen Son of God&#8221;) is patently a conflation of the other two.

As R. E. Brown notes (<i>John </i>[AB], 1:57), &#8220;On the basis of theological tendency&#8230;it is difficult to imagine that Christian scribes would change &#8216;the Son of God&#8217; to &#8216;God&#8217;s chosen one,&#8217; while a change in the opposite direction would be quite plausible. Harmonization with the Synoptic accounts of the baptism (&#8216;You are [This is] my beloved <i>Son</i>&#8217;) would also explain the introduction of &#8216;the Son of God&#8217; into John; the same phenomenon occurs in vi 69. Despite the weaker textual evidence, therefore, it seems best &#8211; with Lagrange, Barrett, Boismard, and others &#8211; to accept &#8216;God&#8217;s chosen one&#8217; as original.&#8221; </p>

B. F. Westcott thought John, unlike the synoptic gospels, was using Roman time, which started at midnight (<i>St. John</i>, 282). This would make the time 10 a.m., which would fit here. But later in the Gospel&#8217;s Passover account (John 19:42, where the sixth hour is on the &#8220;eve of the Passover&#8221;) it seems clear the author had to be using Jewish reckoning, which began at 6 a.m. This would make the time here in 1:39 to be 4 p.m. This may be significant: If the hour was late, Andrew and the unnamed disciple probably spent the night in the same house where Jesus was staying, and the events of 1:41-42 took place on the next day. The evidence for Westcott&#8217;s view, that the Gospel is using Roman time, is very slim. The Roman reckoning which started at midnight was only used by authorities as legal time (for contracts, official documents, etc.). Otherwise, the Romans too reckoned time from 6 a.m. (e.g., Roman sundials are marked VI, not XII, for noon).</p>

However, there were a number of different messianic expectations in 1st century Palestine (see the note on <i>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; </i>in v. 19), and it would be wrong to assume that what Andrew meant here is the same thing the author means in the purpose statement at the end of the Fourth Gospel, 20:31. The issue here is not whether the disciples&#8217; initial faith in Jesus as Messiah was genuine or not, but whether their concept of who Jesus was grew and developed progressively as they spent time following him, until finally after his resurrection it is affirmed in the climactic statement of John&#8217;s Gospel, the affirmation of Thomas in 20:28. </p>

There may have been two places called Bethsaida, or this may merely reflect popular imprecision &#8211; locally it was considered part of Galilee, even though it was just east of the Jordan river.

What Nathanael&#8217;s exact understanding was at this point is hard to determine, but &#8220;son of God&#8221; was a designation for the Davidic king in the OT, and Nathanael parallels it with <i>King of Israel</i> here.</p>

It is associated especially with the themes of crucifixion (3:14; 8:28), revelation (6:27; 6:53), and eschatological authority (5:27; 9:35). The title as used in John&#8217;s Gospel has for its background the son of man figure who appears in Dan 7:13-14 and is granted universal regal authority. Thus for the author, the emphasis in this title is not on Jesus&#8217; humanity, but on his heavenly origin and divine authority.</p>
