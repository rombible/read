<A NAME="1027"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1020><b>sn</b> Jesus contrasts the behavior of the shepherd with that of the <i>hired hand</i>. This is a worker who is simply paid to do a job; he has no other interest in the sheep and is certainly not about to risk his life for them. When they are threatened, he simply runs away.</p>
