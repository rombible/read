<A NAME="1050"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=1043><b>tn</b> Or perhaps &#8220;the Jewish religious leaders&#8221;; <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the Jews.&#8221; In NT usage the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#959;&#965;&#948;&#945;&#8150;&#959;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Ioudaioi</font>) may refer to the entire Jewish people, the residents of Jerusalem and surrounding territory, the authorities in Jerusalem, or merely those who were hostile to Jesus. (For further information see R. G. Bratcher, &#8220;&#8216;The Jews&#8217; in the Gospel of John,&#8221; <i>BT </i>26 [1975]: 401-9.) Here the phrase could be taken to refer to the Jewish religious leaders, since the Pharisees were the last to be mentioned specifically by name, in John 9:40. However, in light of the charge about demon possession, which echoes 8:48, it is more likely that Jewish people in general (perhaps in Jerusalem, if that is understood to be the setting of the incident) are in view here.</p>
