<A NAME="108"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1001><b>sn</b> <i>He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. </i>Some interpreters have suggested that there was more than one flock in the fold, and there would be a process of separation where each shepherd called out his own flock. This may also be suggested by the mention of a <i>doorkeeper</i> in v. 3 since only the larger sheepfolds would have such a guard. But the Gospel of John never mentions a distinction among the sheep in this fold; in fact (10:16) there are other sheep which are to be brought in, but they are to be one flock and one shepherd.</p>
