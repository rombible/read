<A NAME="1030"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1023><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;seizes.&#8221; The more traditional rendering, &#8220;snatches,&#8221; has the idea of seizing something by force and carrying it off, which is certainly possible here. However, in the sequence in John 10:12, this action precedes the scattering of the flock of sheep, so &#8220;attacks&#8221; is preferable.</p>
