<A NAME="1039"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1032><b>sn</b> The statement <i>I have other sheep that do not come from this sheepfold</i> almost certainly refers to Gentiles. Jesus has sheep in the fold who are Jewish; there are other sheep which, while not of the same fold, belong to him also. This recalls the mission of the Son in 3:16-17, which was to save the world &#8211; not just the nation of Israel. Such an emphasis would be particularly appropriate to the author if he were writing to a non-Palestinian and primarily non-Jewish audience.</p>
