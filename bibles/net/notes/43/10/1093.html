John 10:31) by seizing him and taking him out to be stoned. In either event, Jesus <i>escaped their clutches</i>. Nor is it clear whether Jesus&#8217; escape is to be understood as a miracle. If so, the text gives little indication and even less description. What is clear is that until his &#8220;hour&#8221; comes, Jesus is completely safe from the hands of men: His enemies are powerless to touch him until they are permitted to do so.</p>
