<A NAME="1055"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=1048><b>tn</b> That is, Hanukkah or the &#8216;Festival of Lights.&#8217; The Greek name for the feast, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8048; &#7952;&#947;&#954;&#945;&#943;&#957;&#953;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ta enkainia</font>), literally means &#8220;renewal&#8221; and was used to translate <i>Hanukkah</i> which means &#8220;dedication.&#8221; The Greek noun, with its related verbs, was the standard term used in the LXX for the consecration of the altar of the Tabernacle (Num 7:10-11), the altar of the temple of Solomon (1 Kgs 8:63; 2 Chr 7:5), and the altar of the second temple (Ezra 6:16). The word is thus connected with the consecration of all the houses of God in the history of the nation of Israel.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>The feast of the Dedication</i> (also known as Hanukkah) was a feast celebrating annually the Maccabean victories of 165-164 <sc>b.c. &#8211; when Judas Maccabeus drove out the Syrians, rebuilt the altar, and rededicated the temple on 25 Kislev (1 Macc 4:41-61). From a historical standpoint, it was the last great deliverance the Jewish people had experienced, and it came at a time when least expected. Josephus ends his account of the institution of the festival with the following statement: &#8220;And from that time to the present we observe this festival, which we call the festival of Lights, giving this name to it, I think, from the fact that the right to worship appeared to us at a time when we hardly dared hope for it&#8221; (<i>Ant.</i> 12.7.6 [12.325]).</p>
