<A NAME="1026"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1019><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;The good shepherd dies willingly.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Jesus speaks openly of his vicarious death twice in this section (John 10:11, 15). Note the contrast: The thief takes the life of the sheep (10:10), the <i>good shepherd</i> lays down his own <i>life</i> for the sheep. Jesus is not speaking generally here, but specifically: He has his own substitutionary death on the cross in view. For a literal shepherd with a literal flock, the shepherd&#8217;s death would have spelled disaster for the sheep; in this instance it spells life for them (Compare the worthless shepherd of Zech 11:17, by contrast).</p>
