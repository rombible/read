<A NAME="1085"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">85</span><note=1078><b>sn</b> The parenthetical note<i> And the scripture cannot be broken</i> belongs to Jesus&#8217; words rather than the author&#8217;s. Not only does Jesus appeal to the OT to defend himself against the charge of blasphemy, but he also adds that the scripture cannot be &#8220;broken.&#8221; In this context he does not explain precisely what is meant by &#8220;broken,&#8221; but it is not too hard to determine. Jesus&#8217; argument depended on the exact word used in the context of Ps 82:6. If any other word for &#8220;judge&#8221; had been used in the psalm, his argument would have been meaningless. Since the scriptures do use this word in Ps 82:6, the argument is binding, because they cannot be &#8220;broken&#8221; in the sense of being shown to be in error.</p>
