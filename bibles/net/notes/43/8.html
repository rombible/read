<A NAME="81"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=710><b>tc</b> This entire section, 7:53-8:11, traditionally known as the <i>pericope adulterae</i>, is not contained in the earliest and best <sc>mss and was almost certainly not an original part of the Gospel of John. Among modern commentators and textual critics, it is a foregone conclusion that the section is not original but represents a later addition to the text of the Gospel. B. M. Metzger summarizes: &#8220;the evidence for the non-Johannine origin of the pericope of the adulteress is overwhelming&#8221; (<i>TCGNT</i> 187). External evidence is as follows. For the omission of 7:53-8:11: <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>66,75</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B L N T W <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#916;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 0141 0211 33 565 1241 1424* 2768 <i>al</i>. In addition codices A and C are defective in this part of John, but it appears that neither contained the pericope because careful measurement shows that there would not have been enough space on the missing pages to include the pericope 7:53-8:11 along with the rest of the text. Among the <sc>mss that include 7:53-8:11 are D <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font> lat. In addition E S <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#923;</font> 1424<sup>mg</sup> <i>al </i>include part or all of the passage with asterisks or obeli, 225 places the pericope after John 7:36, <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1</sup> places it after John 21:25, {115} after John 8:12, <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13</sup> after Luke 21:38, and the corrector of 1333 includes it after Luke 24:53. (For a more complete discussion of the locations where this &#8220;floating&#8221; text has ended up, as well as a minority opinion on the authenticity of the passage, see M. A. Robinson, &#8220;Preliminary Observations regarding the <i>Pericope Adulterae</i> Based upon Fresh Collations of nearly All Continuous-Text Manuscripts and All Lectionary Manuscripts containing the Passage,&#8221; <i>Filologia Neotestamentaria</i> 13 [2000]: 35-59, especially 41-42.) In evaluating this ms evidence, it should be remembered that in the Gospels A is considered to be of Byzantine texttype (unlike in the epistles and Revelation, where it is Alexandrian), as are E F G (<sc>mss with the same designation are of Western texttype in the epistles). This leaves D as the only major Western uncial witness in the Gospels for the inclusion. Therefore the evidence could be summarized by saying that almost all early <sc>mss of the Alexandrian texttype omit the pericope, while most <sc>mss of the Western and Byzantine texttype include it. But it must be remembered that &#8220;Western <sc>mss&#8221; here refers only to D, a single witness (as far as Greek <sc>mss are concerned). Thus it can be seen that practically all of the earliest and best <sc>mss extant omit the pericope; it is found only in <sc>mss of secondary importance. But before one can conclude that the passage was not originally part of the Gospel of John, internal evidence needs to be considered as well. Internal evidence in favor of the inclusion of 8:1-11 (7:53-8:11): (1) 7:53 fits in the context. If the &#8220;last great day of the feast&#8221; (7:37) refers to the conclusion of the Feast of Tabernacles, then the statement refers to the pilgrims and worshipers going home after living in &#8220;booths&#8221; for the week while visiting Jerusalem. (2) There may be an allusion to Isa 9:1-2 behind this text: John 8:12 is the point when Jesus describes himself as the Light of the world. But the section in question mentions that Jesus returned to the temple at &#8220;early dawn&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8142;&#927;&#961;&#952;&#961;&#959;&#965;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Orqrou</font>, in 8:2). This is the &#8220;dawning&#8221; of the Light of the world (8:12) mentioned by Isa 9:2. (3) Furthermore, note the relationship to what follows: Just prior to presenting Jesus&#8217; statement that he is the Light of the world, John presents the reader with an example that shows Jesus as the light. Here the woman &#8220;came to the light&#8221; while her accusers shrank away into the shadows, because their deeds were evil (cf. 3:19-21). Internal evidence against the inclusion of 8:1-11 (7:53-8:11): (1) In reply to the claim that the introduction to the pericope, 7:53, fits the context, it should also be noted that the narrative reads well without the pericope, so that Jesus&#8217; reply in 8:12 is directed against the charge of the Pharisees in 7:52 that no prophet comes from Galilee. (2) The assumption that the author &#8220;must&#8221; somehow work Isa 9:1-2 into the narrative is simply that &#8211; an assumption. The statement by the Pharisees in 7:52 about Jesus&#8217; Galilean origins is allowed to stand without correction by the author, although one might have expected him to mention that Jesus was really born in Bethlehem. And 8:12 does directly mention Jesus&#8217; claim to be the Light of the world. The author may well have presumed familiarity with Isa 9:1-2 on the part of his readers because of its widespread association with Jesus among early Christians. (3) The fact that the pericope deals with the light/darkness motif does not inherently strengthen its claim to authenticity, because the motif is so prominent in the Fourth Gospel that it may well have been the reason why someone felt that the pericope, circulating as an independent tradition, fit so well here. (4) In general the style of the pericope is not Johannine either in vocabulary or grammar (see D. B. Wallace, &#8220;Reconsidering &#8216;The Story of the Woman Taken in Adultery Reconsidered&#8217;,&#8221; <i>NTS</i> 39 [1993]: 290-96). According to R. E. Brown it is closer stylistically to Lukan material (<i>John </i>[AB], 1:336). Interestingly one important family of <sc>mss (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13</sup>) places the pericope after Luke 21:38. Conclusion: In the final analysis, the weight of evidence in this case must go with the external evidence. The earliest and best <sc>mss do not contain the pericope. It is true with regard to internal evidence that an attractive case can be made for inclusion, but this is by nature subjective (as evidenced by the fact that strong arguments can be given against such as well). In terms of internal factors like vocabulary and style, the pericope does not stand up very well. The question may be asked whether this incident, although not an original part of the Gospel of John, should be regarded as an authentic tradition about Jesus. It could well be that it is ancient and may indeed represent an unusual instance where such a tradition survived outside of the bounds of the canonical literature. However, even that needs to be nuanced (see B. D. Ehrman, &#8220;Jesus and the Adulteress,&#8221; <i>NTS</i> 34 [1988]: 24&#8211;44).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Double brackets have been placed around this passage to indicate that most likely it was not part of the original text of the Gospel of John.

<A NAME="821"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=730><b>sn</b> The theory proposed by F. J. A. Hort (<i>The New Testament in the Original Greek, </i>vol. 2, <i>Introduction; Appendix</i>, 87-88), that the backdrop of 8:12 is the lighting of the candelabra in the court of women, may offer a plausible setting to the proclamation by Jesus that he is <i>the light of the world</i>. The last time that Jesus spoke in the narrative (assuming 7:53-8:11 is not part of the original text, as the textual evidence suggests) is in 7:38, where he was speaking to a crowd of pilgrims in the temple area. This is where he is found in the present verse, and he may be addressing the crowd again. Jesus&#8217; remark has to be seen in view of both the prologue (John 1:4, 5) and the end of the discourse with Nicodemus (John 3:19-21). The coming of Jesus into the world provokes judgment: A choosing up of sides becomes necessary. The one who comes to the light, that is, who follows Jesus, will <i>not</i> walk in the darkness. The one who refuses to come, <i>will</i> walk in the darkness. In this contrast, there are only two alternatives. So it is with a person&#8217;s decision about Jesus. Furthermore, this serves as in implicit indictment of Jesus&#8217; opponents, who still walk in the darkness, because they refuse to come to him. This sets up the contrast in chap. 9 between the man born blind, who receives both physical and spiritual sight, and the Pharisees (John 9:13, 15, 16) who have physical sight but remain in spiritual darkness.</p>

<A NAME="831"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=740><b>sn</b> What is the meaning of Jesus&#8217; statement &#8220;<i>I do not judge anyone</i>&#8221;? It is clear that Jesus did judge (even in the next verse). The point is that he didn&#8217;t practice the same kind of judgment that the Pharisees did. Their kind of judgment was condemnatory. They tried to condemn people. Jesus did not come to judge the world, but to save it (3:17). Nevertheless, and not contradictory to this, the coming of Jesus did bring judgment, because it forced people to make a choice. Would they accept Jesus or reject him? Would they come to the light or shrink back into the darkness? As they responded, so were they judged &#8211; just as 3:19-21 previously stated. One&#8217;s response to Jesus determines one&#8217;s eternal destiny.</p>

Acc. to Mishnah, Shekalim 6, 5 there were in the temple 13 such receptacles in the form of trumpets. But even in these passages the general sense of &#8216;treasury&#8217; is prob., for the contributions would go [into] the treasury via the receptacles.&#8221; Based upon the extra-biblical evidence (see <b>sn</b> following), however, the translation opts to refer to the actual receptacles and not the treasury itself.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The <i>offering box</i> probably refers to the receptacles in the temple forecourt by the Court of Women used to collect freewill offerings.

The author does not mention the interval between 8:12-20 and this next recorded dialogue. The feast of Tabernacles is past, and the next reference to time is 10:22, where the feast of the Dedication is mentioned. The interval is two months, and these discussions could have taken place at any time within that interval, as long as one assumes something of a loose chronological framework. However, if the material in the Fourth Gospel is arranged theologically or thematically, such an assumption would not apply.</p>

The following context supports precisely this idea.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The statement<i> the truth will set you free</i> is often taken as referring to <i>truth</i> in the philosophical (or absolute) sense, or in the intellectual sense, or even (as the Jews apparently took it) in the political sense.

Here repeated, continuous action is in view. The one whose lifestyle is characterized by repeated, continuous sin is a slave to sin. That one is not free; sin has enslaved him. To break free from this bondage requires outside (divine) intervention. Although the statement is true at the general level (the person who continually practices a lifestyle of sin is enslaved to sin) the particular sin of the Jewish authorities, repeatedly emphasized in the Fourth Gospel, is the sin of unbelief. The present tense in this instance looks at the continuing refusal on the part of the Jewish leaders to acknowledge who Jesus is, in spite of mounting evidence.</p>

The use of past tenses would seem to refer to something that occurred during the patriarch&#8217;s lifetime. <i>Genesis Rabbah</i> 44:25ff, (cf. 59:6) states that Rabbi Akiba, in a debate with Rabbi Johanan ben Zakkai, held that Abraham had been shown not this world only but the world to come (this would include the days of the Messiah). More realistically, it is likely that Gen 22:13-15 lies behind Jesus&#8217; words. This passage, known to rabbis as the <i>Akedah</i> (&#8220;Binding&#8221;), tells of Abraham finding the ram which will replace his son Isaac on the altar of sacrifice &#8211; an occasion of certain rejoicing.</p>
