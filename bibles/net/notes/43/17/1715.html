<A NAME="1715"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=1676><b>tn</b> Here &#8220;men&#8221; is retained as a translation for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#8061;&#960;&#959;&#953;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anqrwpoi&quot;</font>) rather than the more generic &#8220;people&#8221; because in context it specifically refers to the eleven men Jesus had chosen as apostles (Judas had already departed, John 13:30). If one understands the referent here to be the broader group of Jesus&#8217; followers that included both men and women, a translation like &#8220;to the people&#8221; should be used here instead.</p>
