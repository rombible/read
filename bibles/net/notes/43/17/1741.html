<A NAME="1741"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1702><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;the son of destruction&#8221; (a Semitic idiom for one appointed for destruction; here it is a reference to Judas).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>The one destined to destruction</i> refers to Judas.<i> </i>Clearly in John&#8217;s Gospel Judas is portrayed as a tool of Satan. He is described as &#8220;the devil&#8221; in 6:70. In 13:2 Satan put into Judas&#8217; heart the idea of betraying Jesus, and 13:27 Satan himself entered Judas. Immediately after this Judas left the company of Jesus and the other disciples and went out into the realm of darkness (13:30). Cf. 2 Thess 2:3, where this same Greek phrase (&#8220;the son of destruction&#8221;; see <b>tn</b> above) is used to describe the man through whom Satan acts to rebel against God in the last days.</p>
