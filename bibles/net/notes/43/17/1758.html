<A NAME="1758"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=1719><b>tn</b> Although <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#965;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pisteuontwn</font>) is a present participle, it must in context carry futuristic force. The disciples whom Jesus is leaving behind will carry on his ministry and in doing so will see others come to trust in him. This will include not only Jewish Christians, but other Gentile Christians who are &#8220;not of this fold&#8221; (10:16), and thus Jesus&#8217; prayer for unity is especially appropriate in light of the probability that most of the readers of the Gospel are Gentiles (much as Paul stresses unity between Jewish and Gentile Christians in Eph 2:10-22).</p>
