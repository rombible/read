<A NAME="173"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1664><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the hour.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>The time has come. </i>Jesus has said before that his &#8220;hour&#8221; had come, both in 12:23 when some Greeks sought to speak with him, and in 13:1 where just before he washed the disciples&#8217; feet. It appears best to understand the &#8220;hour&#8221; as a period of time starting at the end of Jesus&#8217; public ministry and extending through the passion week, ending with Jesus&#8217; return to the Father through death, resurrection, and exaltation. The &#8220;hour&#8221; begins as soon as the first events occur which begin the process that leads to Jesus&#8217; death.</p>
