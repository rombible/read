<A NAME="1753"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">53</span><note=1714><b>sn</b> Jesus now compared the mission on which he was sending the disciples to his own mission <i>into the world</i>, on which he was sent by the Father. As the Father sent Jesus into the world (cf. 3:17), so Jesus now sends the disciples into the world to continue his mission after his departure. The nature of this prayer for the disciples as a consecratory prayer is now emerging: Jesus was setting them apart for the work he had called them to do. They were, in a sense, being commissioned.</p>
