<A NAME="1710"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">10</span><note=1671><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;by finishing&#8221; or &#8220;by accomplishing.&#8221; Jesus now states that he has glorified the Father on earth by finishing (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#949;&#955;&#949;&#953;&#8061;&#963;&#945;&#962;</font> [<font face="Greektl">teleiwsas</font>] is best understood as an adverbial participle of means) the work which the Father had given him to do.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>By completing the work. </i>The idea of Jesus being sent into the world on a mission has been mentioned before, significantly in 3:17. It was even alluded to in the immediately preceding verse here (17:3). The completion of the &#8220;work&#8221; the Father had sent him to accomplish was mentioned by Jesus in 4:34 and 5:36. What is the nature of the &#8220;work&#8221; the Father has given the Son to accomplish? It involves the Son&#8217;s mission to be the Savior of the world, as 3:17 indicates. But this is accomplished specifically through Jesus&#8217; sacrificial death on the cross (a thought implied by the reference to the Father &#8220;giving&#8221; the Son in 3:16). It is not without significance that Jesus&#8217; last word from the cross is &#8220;<i>It is completed</i>&#8221; (19:30).</p>
