<A NAME="1754"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=1715><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;I sanctify.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> In what sense does Jesus refer to his own &#8216;sanctification&#8217; with the phrase <i>I set myself apart</i>? In 10:36 Jesus referred to himself as &#8220;the one whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world,&#8221; which seems to look at something already accomplished. Here, however, it is something he does on behalf of the disciples (<i>on their behalf</i>) and this suggests a reference to his impending death on the cross. There is in fact a Johannine wordplay here based on slightly different meanings for the Greek verb translated <i>set apart </i>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7937;&#947;&#953;&#940;&#950;&#969;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Jagiazw</font>). In the sense it was used in 10:36 of Jesus and in 17:17 and here to refer to the disciples, it means to set apart in the sense that prophets (cf. Jer 1:5) and priests (Exod 40:13, Lev 8:30, and 2 Chr 5:11) were consecrated (or set apart) to perform their tasks. But when Jesus speaks of setting himself apart (consecrating or dedicating himself) on behalf of the disciples here in 17:19 the meaning is closer to the consecration of a sacrificial animal (Deut 15:19). Jesus is &#8220;setting himself apart,&#8221; i.e., dedicating himself, to do the will of the Father, that is, to go to the cross on the disciples&#8217; behalf (and of course on behalf of their successors as well).</p>
