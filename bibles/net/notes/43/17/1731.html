<A NAME="1731"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1692><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;I have been honored among them.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The theme of glory with which Jesus began this prayer in 17:1-5 now recurs. Jesus said that he had been <i>glorified</i> by his disciples, but in what sense was this true? Jesus had manifested his glory to them in all of the sign-miracles which he had performed, beginning with the miracle at the wedding feast in Cana (2:11). He could now say that he had <i>been glorified by them</i> in the light of what he had already said in vv. 7-8, that the disciples had come to know that he had come from the Father and been sent by the Father. He would, of course, be glorified by them further after the resurrection, as they carried on his ministry after his departure.</p>
