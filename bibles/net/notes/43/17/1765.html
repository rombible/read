<A NAME="1765"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=1726><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;men&#8221; is not in the Greek text but is implied. The translation uses the word &#8220;men&#8221; here rather than a more general term like &#8220;people&#8221; because the use of the aorist verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#947;&#957;&#969;&#963;&#945;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">egnwsan</font>) implies that Jesus is referring to the disciples present with him as he spoke these words (presumably all of them men in the historical context), rather than to those who are yet to believe because of their testimony (see John 17:20).</p>
