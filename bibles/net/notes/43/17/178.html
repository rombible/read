<A NAME="178"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1669><b>sn</b> <i>This is eternal life. </i>The author here defines <i>eternal life</i> for the readers, although it is worked into the prayer in such a way that many interpreters do not regard it as another of the author&#8217;s parenthetical comments. It is not just unending life in the sense of prolonged duration. Rather it is a quality of life, with its quality derived from a relationship with God. Having eternal life is here defined as being in relationship with the Father, the one true God, and Jesus Christ whom the Father sent. <i>Christ </i>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#972;&#962;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Cristos</font>) is not characteristically attached to Jesus&#8217; name in John&#8217;s Gospel; it occurs elsewhere primarily as a title and is used with Jesus&#8217; name only in 1:17. But that is connected to its use here: The statement here in 17:3 enables us to correlate the statement made in 1:18 of the prologue, that Jesus has fully revealed what God is like, with Jesus&#8217; statement in 10:10 that he has come that people might have life, and have it abundantly. These two purposes are really one, according to 17:3, because (abundant) eternal life is defined as knowing (being in relationship with) the Father and the Son. The only way to gain this eternal life, that is, to obtain this knowledge of the Father, is through the Son (cf. 14:6). Although some have pointed to the use of <i>know </i>(<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#947;&#953;&#957;&#8061;&#963;&#954;&#969;</font>, <font face="Greektl">ginwskw</font>) here as evidence of Gnostic influence in the Fourth Gospel, there is a crucial difference: For John this knowledge is not intellectual, but relational. It involves being in relationship.</p>
