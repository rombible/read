This was a common belief in Judaism; the rabbis used Ezek 18:20 to prove there was no death without sin, and Ps 89:33 to prove there was no punishment without guilt (the Babylonian Talmud, <i>b. Shabbat </i>55a, although later than the NT, illustrates this). Thus in this case the sin must have been on the part of the man&#8217;s parents, or during his own prenatal existence. <i>Song Rabbah</i> 1:41 (another later rabbinic work) stated that when a pregnant woman worshiped in a heathen temple the unborn child also committed idolatry. This is only one example of how, in rabbinic Jewish thought, an unborn child was capable of sinning.</p>
