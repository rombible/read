<A NAME="913"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=886><b>sn</b> Jesus&#8217; statement <i>I am the light of the world</i> connects the present account with 8:12. Here (seen more clearly than at 8:12) it is obvious what the author sees as the significance of Jesus&#8217; statement. &#8220;Light&#8221; is not a metaphysical definition of the person of Jesus but a description of his effect on the world, forcing everyone in the world to &#8216;choose up sides&#8217; for or against him (cf. 3:19-21).</p>
