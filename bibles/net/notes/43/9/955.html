But here, since <i>prophet </i>is anarthrous (is not accompanied by the Greek article) and since in his initial reply in 9:11-12 the man showed no particular insight into the true identity of Jesus, this probably does not refer to <i>the</i> prophet of Deut 18:15, but merely to an unusual person who is capable of working miracles. The Pharisees had put this man on the spot, and he felt compelled to say something about Jesus, but he still didn&#8217;t have a clear conception of who Jesus was, so he labeled him a &#8220;prophet.&#8221;</p>
