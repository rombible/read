<A NAME="91"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=874><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;going along.&#8221; The opening words of chap. 9, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#960;&#945;&#961;&#940;&#947;&#969;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai paragwn</font>), convey only the vaguest indication of the circumstances. </p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Since there is no break with chap. 8, Jesus is presumably still in Jerusalem, and presumably <i>not</i> still in the temple area. The events of chap. 9 fall somewhere between the feast of Tabernacles (John 7:2) and the feast of the Dedication (John 10:22). But in the author&#8217;s narrative the connection exists &#8211; the incident recorded in chap. 9 (along with the ensuing debates with the Pharisees) serves as a real-life illustration of the claim Jesus made in 8:12, <i>I am the light of the world.</i> This is in fact the probable theological motivation behind the juxtaposition of these two incidents in the narrative. The second serves as an illustration of the first, and as a concrete example of the victory of light over darkness. One other thing which should be pointed out about the miracle recorded in chap. 9 is its messianic significance. In the OT it is God himself who is associated with the giving of sight to the blind (Exod 4:11, Ps 146:8). In a number of passages in Isa (29:18, 35:5, 42:7) it is considered to be a messianic activity.</p>
