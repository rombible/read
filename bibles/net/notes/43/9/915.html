<A NAME="915"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">15</span><note=888><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;clay&#8221; (moistened earth of a clay-like consistency). The textual variant preserved in the Syriac text of Ephraem&#8217;s commentary on the <i>Diatessaron</i> (&#8220;he made eyes from his clay&#8221;) probably arose from the interpretation given by Irenaeus in <i>Against Heresies</i>: &#8220;that which the Artificer, the Word, had omitted to form in the womb, he then supplied in public.&#8221; This involves taking the clay as an allusion to Gen 2:7, which is very unlikely.</p>
