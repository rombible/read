<A NAME="9108"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">108</span><note=981><b>sn</b> Assuming the authenticity of John 9:38-39a (see the <b>tc</b> note following the bracket in v. 39), the man&#8217;s response after Jesus&#8217; statement of v. 37 is extremely significant: He <i>worshiped </i>Jesus. In the Johannine context the word would connote its full sense: This was something due God alone. Note also that Jesus did not prevent the man from doing this. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#954;&#965;&#957;&#941;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">proskunew</font>) is used in John 4:20-25 of worshiping God, and again with the same sense in 12:20. This would be the only place in John&#8217;s Gospel where anyone is said to have worshiped Jesus using this term. As such, it forms the climax of the story of the man born blind, but the uniqueness of the concept of worshiping Jesus at this point in John's narrative (which reaches its ultimate climax in the confession of Thomas in John 20:28) may suggest it is too early for such a response and it represents a later scribal addition.</p>
