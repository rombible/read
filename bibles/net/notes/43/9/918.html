<A NAME="918"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=891><b>tn</b> The pool&#8217;s name in Hebrew is <i>shiloah</i> from the Hebrew verb &#8220;to send.&#8221; In Gen 49:10 the somewhat obscure <i>shiloh</i> was interpreted messianically by later Jewish tradition, and some have seen a lexical connection between the two names (although this is somewhat dubious). It is known, however, that it was from the pool of Siloam that the water which was poured out at the altar during the feast of Tabernacles was drawn.</p>
