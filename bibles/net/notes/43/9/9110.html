<A NAME="9110"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">110</span><note=983><b>tc</b> &#8225; Some early and important witnesses (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>75</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* W b sa<sup>ms</sup> ac<sup>2</sup> mf) lack the words, &#8220;He said, &#8216;Lord, I believe,&#8217; and he worshiped him. Jesus said,&#8221; (vv. 38-39a). This is weighty evidence for the omission of these words. It is difficult to overstate the value of <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>75</sup> here, since it is the only currently available papyrus ms extant for the text of John 9:38-39. Further, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> is an important and early Alexandrian witness for the omission. The versional testimony and codex W also give strong support to the omission. Nearly all other <sc>mss, however, include these words. The omission may have been occasioned by parablepsis (both vv. 37 and 39 begin with &#8220;Jesus said to him&#8221;), though it is difficult to account for such an error across such a wide variety of witnesses. On the other hand, the longer reading appears to be motivated by liturgical concerns (so R. E. Brown, <i>John </i>[AB], 1:375), since the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#954;&#965;&#957;&#941;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">proskunew</font>, &#8220;I worship&#8221;) is used in John 4:20-25 of worshiping God, and again with the same sense in 12:20. If these words were authentic here, this would be the only place in John&#8217;s Gospel where Jesus is the explicit object of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#954;&#965;&#957;&#941;&#969;</font>. Even if these words are not authentic, such an omission would nevertheless hardly diminish John&#8217;s high Christology (cf. 1:1; 5:18-23; 14:6-10; 20:28), nor the implicit worship of him by Thomas (20:28). Nevertheless, a decision is difficult, and the included words may reflect a very early tradition about the blind man&#8217;s response to Jesus.</p>
