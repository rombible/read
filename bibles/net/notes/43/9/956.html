<A NAME="956"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">56</span><note=929><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the Jewish religious authorities&#8221;; <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the Jews.&#8221; In NT usage the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#959;&#965;&#948;&#945;&#8150;&#959;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Ioudaioi</font>) may refer to the entire Jewish people, the residents of Jerusalem and surrounding territory, the authorities in Jerusalem, or merely those who were hostile to Jesus. (For further information see R. G. Bratcher, &#8220;&#8216;The Jews&#8217; in the Gospel of John,&#8221; <i>BT </i>26 [1975]: 401-9.) Here the phrase refers mainly to the Pharisees, mentioned by name in John 9:13, 15, 16. References in this context to Pharisees and to the synagogue (v. 22) suggest an emphasis on the religious nature of the debate which is brought out by the translation &#8220;the Jewish religious leaders.&#8221;</p>
