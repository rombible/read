<A NAME="51"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=369><b>sn</b> The temporal indicator <i>After this </i>is not specific, so it is uncertain how long after the incidents at Cana this occurred.</p>
<A NAME="52"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=370><b>tc</b> The textual variants <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7953;&#959;&#961;&#964;&#8053;</font> or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7969; &#7953;&#959;&#961;&#964;&#8053;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jeorth </font>or <font face="Greektl">Jh Jeorth</font>, &#8220;a feast&#8221; or &#8220;the feast&#8221;) may not appear significant at first, but to read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7953;&#959;&#961;&#964;&#8053; </font>with the article would almost certainly demand a reference to the Jewish Passover. The article is found in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> </font>C L <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#916; &#936; </font><font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1 </sup>33 892 1424 <i>pm</i>, but is lacking in {<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>66,75</sup> A B D T W<sup>s</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920; </font><font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>13</sup> 565 579 700 1241 <i>pm</i>}. Overall, the shorter reading has somewhat better support. Internally, the known proclivity of scribes to make the text more explicit argues compellingly for the shorter reading. Thus, the verse refers to a feast other than the Passover. The incidental note in 5:3, that the sick were lying outside in the porticoes of the pool, makes Passover an unlikely time because it fell toward the end of winter and the weather would not have been warm. L. Morris (<i>John </i>[NICNT],<i> </i>299, n. 6) thinks it impossible to identify the feast with certainty.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>A Jewish feast. </i>Jews were obligated to go up to Jerusalem for 3 major annual feasts: Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles. If the first is probably ruled out because of the time of year, the last is not as likely because it forms the central setting for chap. 7 (where there are many indications in the context that Tabernacles is the feast in view.) This leaves the feast of Pentecost, which at some point prior to this time in Jewish tradition (as reflected in Jewish intertestamental literature and later post-Christian rabbinic writings) became identified with the giving of the law to Moses on Mount Sinai. Such an association might explain Jesus&#8217; reference to Moses in 5:45-46. This is uncertain, however. The only really important fact for the author is that the healing was done on a Sabbath. This is what provoked the controversy with the Jewish authorities recorded in 5:16-47.</p>

<A NAME="55"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=373><b>tn</b> The site of the miracle is also something of a problem: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#946;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8135;</font> (<font face="Greektl">probatikh</font>) is usually taken as a reference to the Sheep <i>Gate</i> near the temple. Some (R. E. Brown and others) would place the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#959;&#955;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#8053;&#952;&#961;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kolumbhqra</font>) with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#946;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8135;</font> to read &#8220;in Jerusalem, by the Sheep <i>Pool</i>, there is (another pool) with the Hebrew name.&#8221; This would imply that there is reference to two pools in the context rather than only one. This does not seem necessary (although it is a grammatical possibility). The gender of the words does not help since both are feminine (as is the participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#955;&#949;&#947;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#951;</font> [<font face="Greektl">epilegomenh</font>]). Note however that Brown&#8217;s suggestion would require a feminine word to be supplied (for the participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#955;&#949;&#947;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#951;</font> to modify). The traditional understanding of the phrase as a reference to the Sheep Gate near the temple appears more probably correct.</p>
<A NAME="56"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=374><b>tc</b> Some <sc>mss (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> [L] 33 it) read <i>Bethzatha</i>, while others read <i>Bethsaida</i> (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>[66],75</sup> B T W<sup>s</sup> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font>] <i>pc</i> vg); codex D has <i>Belzetha</i>. A lot of controversy has surrounded the name of the pool itself: The reading of the Byzantine (or majority) text (A C <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> 078 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13</sup> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>), <i>Bethesda</i>, has been virtually discarded by scholars in favor of what is thought to be the more primitive <i>Bethzatha</i>, even though many recent translations continue to employ <i>Bethesda</i>, the traditional reading. The latter is attested by Josephus as the name of a quarter of the city near the northeast corner of the temple area. He reports that the Syrian Legate Cestius burned this suburb in his attack on Jerusalem in October <sc>a.d. 68 (<i>J. W.</i> 2.19.4 [2.530]). However, there is some new archaeological evidence for this problem. 3Q15 (Copper Scroll) from Qumran seems to indicate that in the general area of the temple, on the eastern hill of Jerusalem, a treasure was buried in <i>Bet </i><i><font face="Scholar">á</font>Esdatayin</i>, in the pool at the entrance to the smaller basin. The name of the region or pool itself seems then to have been <i>Bet </i><i><font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;</font>Esda</i>, &#8220;house of the flowing.&#8221; It appears with the dual ending in the scroll because there were two basins. <i>Bethesda </i>seems to be an accurate Greek rendition of the name, while J. T. Milik suggests <i>Bethzatha</i> is a rendition of the Aramaic intensive plural <i>Bet </i><i><font face="Scholar">á</font>Esdata</i> (DJDJ 3, 271). As for the text of John 5:2, the fundamental problems with the <i>Bethesda</i> reading are that it looks motivated (with an edifying Semitic etymology, meaning &#8220;House of Mercy&#8221; [<i>TCGNT</i> 178]), and is minimally attested. Apart from the Copper Scroll, the evidence for <i>Bethesda</i> is almost entirely shut up to the Byzantine text (C being the most notable exception, but it often has Byzantine encroachments). On the one hand, this argues the Byzantine reading here had ancient, semitic roots; on the other hand, since both readings are attested as historically accurate, a decision has to be based on the better witnesses. The fact that there are multiple readings here suggests that the original was not well understood. Which reading best explains the rise of the others? It seems that <i>Bethzatha</i> is the best choice.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> On the location of the <i>pool called Bethzatha</i>, the double-pool of St. Anne is the probable site, and has been excavated; the pools were trapezoidal in shape, 165 ft (49.5 m) wide at one end, 220 ft (66 m) wide at the other, and 315 ft (94.5 m) long, divided by a central partition. There were colonnades (rows of columns) on all 4 sides and on the partition, thus forming the <i>five covered walkways</i> mentioned in John 5:2. Stairways at the corners permitted descent to the pool.</p>

<A NAME="532"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=400><b>tn</b> <i>Grk </i>&#8220;answered.&#8221; </p>
<A NAME="533"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=401><b>sn</b> &#8220;<i>My Father is working until now, and I too am working.</i>&#8221;<i> </i>What is the significance of Jesus&#8217; claim? A preliminary understanding can be obtained from John 5:18, noting the Jewish authorities&#8217; response and the author&#8217;s comment. They sought to kill Jesus, because not only was he <i>breaking the Sabbath</i>, but he was also <i>calling God his own Father</i>, thus making himself equal with God. This must be seen in the context of the relation of God to the Sabbath rest. In the commandment (Exod 20:11) it is explained that &#8220;In six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth&#8230;and rested on the seventh day; therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.&#8221; Philo, based on the LXX translation of Exod 20:11, denied outright that God had ever ceased his creative activity. And when Rabban Gamaliel II, R. Joshua, R. Eleazar ben Azariah, and R. Akiba were in Rome, ca. <sc>a.d. 95, they gave as a rebuttal to sectarian arguments evidence that God might do as he willed in the world without breaking the Sabbath because the entire world was his private residence. So even the rabbis realized that God did not really cease to work on the Sabbath: Divine providence remained active on the Sabbath, otherwise, all nature and life would cease to exist. As regards men, divine activity was visible in two ways: Men were born and men died on the Sabbath. Since only God could give life and only God could deal with the fate of the dead in judgment, this meant God was active on the Sabbath. This seems to be the background for Jesus&#8217; words in 5:17. He justified his work of healing on the Sabbath by reminding the Jewish authorities that they admitted God worked on the Sabbath. This explains the violence of the reaction. The Sabbath privilege was peculiar to God, and no one was equal to God. In claiming the right to work even as his Father worked, Jesus was claiming a divine prerogative. He was literally making himself equal to God, as 5:18 goes on to state explicitly for the benefit of the reader who might not have made the connection.</p>

The same that the Father does &#8211; and the same that the rabbis recognized as legitimate works of God on the Sabbath (see note on <i>working</i> in v. 17). (1) Jesus grants life (just as the Father grants life) on the Sabbath. But as the Father gives physical life on the Sabbath, so the Son grants spiritual life (John 5:21; note the &#8220;greater things&#8221; mentioned in v. 20). (2) Jesus judges (determines the destiny of people) on the Sabbath, just as the Father judges those who die on the Sabbath, because the Father has granted authority to the Son to judge (John 5:22-23). But this is not all. Not only has this power been granted to Jesus in the present; it will be his in the future as well. In v. 28 there is a reference not to spiritually dead (only) but also physically dead. At their resurrection they respond to the Son as well.</p>

Either is grammatically possible. This is possibly an instance of a plenary genitive (see <i>ExSyn</i> 119-21; M. Zerwick, <i>Biblical Greek</i>, §§36-39). If so, the emphasis would be on the love God gives which in turn produces love for him, but Jesus&#8217; opponents are lacking any such love inside them.</p>

Internally, it could be argued that the name of God was not used here, in keeping with the NT practice of suppressing the name of God at times for rhetorical effect, drawing the reader inexorably to the conclusion that the one being spoken of is God himself. On the other hand, never is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#956;&#972;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jo mono&quot;</font>) used absolutely in the NT (i.e., without a noun or substantive with it), and always the subject of the adjunct is God (cf. Matt 24:36; John 17:3; 1 Tim 6:16). What then is to explain the shorter reading? In uncial script, with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font> written as a <i>nomen sacrum</i>, envisioning accidental omission of the name by way of homoioteleuton requires little imagination, largely because of the succession of words ending in -<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#965;</font>: <font face="Greek Uncials">toumonouqMuou</font>.

<A NAME="579"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">79</span><note=447><b>sn</b> The final condemnation will come from <i>Moses</i> himself &#8211; again ironic, since Moses is the very one the Jewish authorities have trusted in (<i>placed your hope</i>). This is again ironic if it is occurring at Pentecost, which at this time was being celebrated as the occasion of the giving of the Torah to Moses on Mt. Sinai. There is evidence that some Jews of the 1st century looked on Moses as their intercessor at the final judgment (see W. A. Meeks, <i>The Prophet King</i> [NovTSup], 161). This would mean the statement <i>Moses, in whom you have placed your hope </i>should be taken literally and relates directly to Jesus&#8217; statements about the final judgment in John 5:28-29.</p>
