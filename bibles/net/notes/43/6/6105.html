<A NAME="6105"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">105</span><note=554><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Does this cause you to no longer believe?&#8221; (<i>Grk</i> &#8220;cause you to stumble?&#8221;)</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>Does this cause you to be offended? </i>It became apparent to some of Jesus&#8217; followers at this point that there would be a cost involved in following him. They had taken offense at some of Jesus&#8217; teaching (perhaps the graphic imagery of &#8220;eating his flesh&#8221; and &#8220;drinking his blood,&#8221; and Jesus now warned them that if they thought this was a problem, there was an even worse cause for stumbling in store: his upcoming crucifixion (John 6:61b-62). Jesus asked, in effect, &#8220;Has what I just taught caused you to stumble? What will you do, then, <i>if you see the Son of Man ascending where he was before?</i>&#8221; This ascent is to be accomplished through the cross; for John, Jesus&#8217; departure from this world and his return to the Father form one continual movement from cross to resurrection to ascension.</p>
