<A NAME="62"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=451><b>sn</b> This is a parenthetical note by the author. Only John in the New Testament refers to the Sea of Galilee by the name <i>Sea of Tiberias</i> (see also John 21:1), but this is correct local usage. In the mid-20&#8217;s Herod completed the building of the town of Tiberias on the southwestern shore of the lake; after this time the name came into use for the lake itself.</p>
