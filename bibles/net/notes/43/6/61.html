<A NAME="61"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=450><b>tn</b> Again, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#949;&#964;&#8048; &#964;&#945;&#8166;&#964;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">meta tauta</font>) is a vague temporal reference. How Jesus got from Jerusalem to Galilee is not explained, which has led many scholars (e.g., Bernard, Bultmann, and Schnackenburg) to posit either editorial redaction or some sort of rearrangement or dislocation of material (such as reversing the order of chaps. 5 and 6, for example). Such a rearrangement of the material would give a simple and consistent connection of events, but in the absence of all external evidence it does not seem to be supportable. R. E. Brown (<i>John </i>[AB], 1:236) says that such an arrangement is attractive in some ways but not compelling, and that no rearrangement can solve all the geographical and chronological problems in John.</p>
