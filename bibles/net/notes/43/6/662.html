<A NAME="662"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">62</span><note=511><b>sn</b> Notice that here the result (having <i>eternal life</i> and being raised up <i>at the last day</i>) is produced by looking on the Son and believing in him. Compare John 6:54 where the same result is produced by eating Jesus&#8217; <i>flesh</i> and drinking his <i>blood</i>. This suggests that the phrase in 6:54 (<i>eats my flesh and drinks my blood</i>) is to be understood in terms of the phrase here (<i>looks on the Son and believes in him</i>).</p>
