<A NAME="6120"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">120</span><note=569><b>sn</b> At least six explanations for the name <i>Iscariot</i> have been proposed, but it is probably transliterated Hebrew with the meaning &#8220;man of Kerioth&#8221; (there are at least two villages that had that name). See D. A. Carson, <i>John</i>, 304.</p>
