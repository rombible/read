<A NAME="658"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=507><b>tc</b> A few witnesses lack <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#949; </font>(<font face="Greektl">me</font>, &#8220;me&#8221;; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek"> </font>A a b e q sy<sup>s,c</sup>), while the rest of the tradition has the word (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>66,75vid</sup> <i>rell</i>). It is possible that the <sc>mss that lack the pronoun preserve the original wording here, with the rest of the witnesses adding the pronoun for clarity&#8217;s sake. This likelihood increases since the object is not required in Greek. Without it, however, ambiguity increases: The referent could be &#8220;me&#8221; or it could be &#8220;signs,&#8221; reaching back to vv. 26 and 30. However, the oblique form of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#947;&#8061;</font> (<font face="Greektl">egw</font>, the first person personal pronoun) occurs some two dozen times in this chapter alone, yet it vacillates between the emphatic form and the unemphatic form. Although generally the unemphatic form is used with verbs, there are several exceptions to this in John (cf. 8:12; 12:26, 45, 48; 13:20; 14:9). If the pronoun is a later addition here, one wonders why it is so consistently the unemphatic form in the <sc>mss. Further, that two unrelated Greek witnesses lack this small word could easily be due to accidental deletion. Finally, the date and diversity of the witnesses for the pronoun are so weighty that it is likely to be authentic and should thus be retained in the text.</p>
