<A NAME="686"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">86</span><note=535><b>sn</b> Notice that here the result (<i>has eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day</i>) is produced by eating (Jesus&#8217;) <i>flesh</i> and drinking his <i>blood</i>. Compare John 6:40 where the same result is produced by &#8220;looking on the Son and believing in him.&#8221; This suggests that the phrase here (<i>eats my flesh and drinks my blood</i>) is to be understood by the phrase in 6:40 (<i>looks on the Son and believes in him</i>).</p>
