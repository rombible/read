<A NAME="622"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=471><b>sn</b> Jesus, knowing that his &#8220;hour&#8221; had not yet come (and would not, in this fashion) <i>withdrew again up the mountainside alone</i>. The ministry of miracles in Galilee, ending with this, the multiplication of the bread (the last public miracle in Galilee recorded by John) aroused such a popular response that there was danger of an uprising. This would have given the authorities a legal excuse to arrest Jesus. The nature of Jesus&#8217; kingship will become an issue again in the passion narrative of the Fourth Gospel (John 18:33ff.). Furthermore, the volatile reaction of the Galileans to the signs prepares for and foreshadows the misunderstanding of the miracle itself, and even the misunderstanding of Jesus&#8217; explanation of it (John 6:22-71).</p>
