<A NAME="690"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">90</span><note=539><b>sn</b> <i>Resides in me, and I in him. </i>Note how in John 6:54 eating Jesus&#8217; <i>flesh</i> and drinking his <i>blood</i> produces <i>eternal life </i>and the promise of resurrection <i>at the last day</i>. Here the same process of eating Jesus&#8217; <i>flesh</i> and drinking his <i>blood</i> leads to a relationship of mutual indwelling (<i>resides in me, and I in him</i>). This suggests strongly that for the author (and for Jesus) the concepts of &#8216;possessing eternal life&#8217; and of &#8216;residing in Jesus&#8217; are virtually interchangeable.</p>
