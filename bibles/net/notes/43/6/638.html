<A NAME="638"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">38</span><note=487><b>sn</b> <i>John 6:25-31.</i> The previous miracle of the multiplication of the bread had taken place near the town of Tiberias (cf. John 6:23). Jesus&#8217; disciples set sail for Capernaum (6:17) and were joined by the Lord in the middle of the sea. The next day boats from Tiberias picked up a few of those who had seen the multiplication (certainly not the whole 5,000) and brought them to Capernaum. It was to this group that Jesus spoke in 6:26-27. But there were also people from Capernaum who had gathered to see Jesus, who had <i>not</i> witnessed the multiplication, and it was <i>this</i> group that asked Jesus for a miraculous sign like the manna (6:30-31). This would have seemed superfluous if it were the same crowd that had already seen the multiplication of the bread. But some from Capernaum had heard about it and wanted to see a similar miracle repeated.</p>
