Although the shorter reading has minimal support, it is significant that this Gospel speaks of Jesus as Lord in the evangelist&#8217;s narrative descriptions only in 11:2; 20:18, 20; 21:12; and possibly 4:1 (but see <b>tc</b> note on &#8220;Jesus&#8221; there). There is thus but one undisputed preresurrection text in which the narrator calls Jesus &#8220;Lord.&#8221; This fact can be utilized on behalf of either reading: The participial phrase could be seen as a scribal addition harking back to 6:11 but which does not fit Johannine style, or it could be viewed as truly authentic and in line with what John indisputably does elsewhere even if rarely. On balance, in light of the overwhelming support for these words it is probably best to retain them in the text.</p>
