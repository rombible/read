<A NAME="6119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">119</span><note=568><b>tn</b> Although most translations render this last phrase as &#8220;one of you is <i>a </i>devil,&#8221; such a translation presupposes that there is more than one devil. This finds roots in the KJV in which the Greek word for demon was often translated &#8220;devil.&#8221; In fact, the KJV never uses the word &#8220;demon.&#8221; (Sixty-two of the 63 NT instances of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#945;&#953;&#956;&#972;&#957;&#953;&#959;&#957;</font> [<font face="Greektl">daimonion</font>] are translated &#8220;devil&#8221; [in Acts 17:18 the plural has been translated &#8220;gods&#8221;]. This can get confusing in places where the singular &#8220;devil&#8221; is used: Is Satan or one of the demons in view [cf. Matt 9:33 (demon); 13:39 (devil); 17:18 (demon); Mark 7:26 (demon); Luke 4:2 (devil); etc.]?) Now regarding John 6:70, both the construction in Greek and the technical use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#940;&#946;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">diabolos</font>) indicate that the one devil is in view. To object to the translation &#8220;the devil&#8221; because it thus equates Judas with Satan does not take into consideration that Jesus often spoke figuratively (e.g., &#8220;destroy this temple&#8221; [John 2:19]; &#8220;he [John the Baptist] is Elijah&#8221; [Matt 11:14]), even equating Peter with the devil on one occasion (Mark 8:33). According to <i>ExSyn</i> 249, &#8220;A curious phenomenon has occurred in the English Bible with reference to one particular monadic noun, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#940;&#946;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font>. The KJV translates both <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#940;&#946;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font> and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#945;&#953;&#956;&#972;&#957;&#953;&#959;&#957;</font> as &#8216;devil.&#8217; Thus in the AV translators&#8217; minds, &#8216;devil&#8217; was not a monadic noun. Modern translations have correctly rendered <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#945;&#953;&#956;&#972;&#957;&#953;&#959;&#957;</font> as &#8216;demon&#8217; and have, for the most part, recognized that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#953;&#940;&#946;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#962;</font> is monadic (cf., e.g., 1 Pet 5:8; Rev 20:2). But in John 6:70 modern translations have fallen into the error of the King James translators. The KJV has &#8216;one of you is a devil.&#8217; So does the RSV, NRSV, ASV, NIV, NKJV, and the JB [Jerusalem Bible]. Yet there is only one devil&#8230;The legacy of the KJV still lives on, then, even in places where it ought not.&#8221;</p>
