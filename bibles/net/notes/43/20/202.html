<A NAME="202"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=1972><b>sn</b> John does not mention that <i>Mary Magdalene</i> was accompanied by any of the other women who had been among Jesus&#8217; followers. The synoptic accounts all mention other women who accompanied her (although Mary Magdalene is always mentioned first). Why John does not mention the other women is not clear, but Mary probably becomes the focus of the author&#8217;s attention because it was she who came and found Peter and the beloved disciple and informed them of the empty tomb (20:2). Mary&#8217;s use of the plural in v. 2 indicates there were others present, in indirect agreement with the synoptic accounts.</p>
