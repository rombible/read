<A NAME="206"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1976><b>sn</b> The <i>other disciple </i>(the &#8216;beloved disciple&#8217;) ran on ahead more quickly than Peter, so he arrived at the tomb first. This verse has been a chief factor in depictions of John as a young man (especially combined with traditions that he wrote last of all the gospel authors and lived into the reign of Domitian). But the verse does not actually say anything about John&#8217;s age, nor is age always directly correlated with running speed.</p>
