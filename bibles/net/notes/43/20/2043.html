<A NAME="2043"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=2013><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;it&#8221; is not in the Greek text but is implied. Direct objects were often omitted in Greek when clear from the context. The use of &#8220;it&#8221; here as direct object of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#963;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pisteusw</font>) specifies exactly what Thomas was refusing to believe: that Jesus had risen from the dead, as reported by his fellow disciples. Otherwise the English reader may be left with the impression Thomas was refusing to &#8220;believe in&#8221; Jesus, or &#8220;believe Jesus to be the Christ.&#8221; The dramatic tension in this narrative is heightened when Thomas, on seeing for himself the risen Christ, believes <i>more</i> than just the resurrection (see John 20:28).</p>
