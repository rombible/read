<A NAME="2016"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">16</span><note=1986><b>sn</b> Verse 9 is a parenthetical note by the author. The author does not explicitly mention what OT <i>scripture</i> is involved (neither does Paul in 1 Cor 15:4, for that matter). The resurrection of the Messiah in general terms may have been seen in Isa 53:10-12 and Ps 16:10. Specific references may have been understood in Jonah 1:17 and Hos 6:2 because of the mention of &#8220;the third day.&#8221; Beyond this it is not possible to be more specific.</p>
