<A NAME="2052"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=2022><b>sn</b> Should Thomas&#8217; exclamation be understood as two subjects with the rest of the sentence omitted (&#8220;<i>My Lord and my God</i> has truly risen from the dead&#8221;), as predicate nominatives (&#8220;You are <i>my Lord and my God</i>&#8221;), or as vocatives (&#8220;<i>My Lord and my God!</i>&#8221;)? Probably the most likely is something between the second and third alternatives. It seems that the second is slightly more likely here, because the context appears confessional. Thomas&#8217; statement, while it may have been an exclamation, does in fact confess the faith which he had previously lacked, and Jesus responds to Thomas&#8217; statement in the following verse as if it were a confession. With the proclamation by Thomas here, it is difficult to see how any more profound analysis of Jesus&#8217; person could be given. It echoes 1:1 and 1:14 together: The Word was God, and the Word became flesh (Jesus of Nazareth). The Fourth Gospel opened with many other titles for Jesus: the Lamb of God (1:29, 36); the Son of God (1:34, 49); Rabbi (1:38); Messiah (1:41); the King of Israel (1:49); the Son of Man (1:51). Now the climax is reached with the proclamation by Thomas, &#8220;My Lord and my God,&#8221; and the reader has come full circle from 1:1, where the author had introduced him to who Jesus was, to 20:28, where the last of the disciples has come to the full realization of who Jesus was. What Jesus had predicted in John 8:28 had come to pass: &#8220;When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he&#8221; (<i>Grk </i>&#8220;I am&#8221;). By being lifted up in crucifixion (which led in turn to his death, resurrection, and exaltation with the Father) Jesus has revealed his true identity as both Lord (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#973;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#962;</font> [<font face="Greektl">kurios</font>], used by the LXX to translate <i>Yahweh</i>) and God (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</font> [<font face="Greektl">qeos</font>], used by the LXX to translate <i>Elohim</i>).</p>
