<A NAME="2035"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=2005><b>sn</b> When the disciples recognized Jesus (now referred to as <i>the Lord</i>, cf. Mary&#8217;s words in v. 18) they were suddenly overcome with joy. This was a fulfillment of Jesus&#8217; words to the disciples in the Farewell Discourse (16:20-22) that they would have sorrow while the world rejoiced, but that their sorrow would be turned to lasting joy when they saw him again.</p>
