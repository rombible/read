<A NAME="2061"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=2031><b>tc</b> &#8225; A difficult textual variant is present at this point in the Greek text. Some <sc>mss (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>66vid</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font>* B <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> 0250 <i>pc</i>) read the present subjunctive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#951;&#964;&#949;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pisteuhte</font>) after <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jina</font>; thus NEB text, &#8220;that you may hold the faith&#8221;) while others (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font><sup>2</sup> A C D L W <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13 </sup>33 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>) read the aorist subjunctive <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#963;&#951;&#964;&#949;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pisteushte</font>) after <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</font> (cf. NEB margin, &#8220;that you may come to believe&#8221;). As reflected by the renderings of the NEB text and margin, it is often assumed that the present tense would suggest ongoing belief (i.e., the Fourth Gospel primarily addressed those who already believed, and was intended to strengthen their faith), while the aorist tense would speak of coming to faith (i.e., John&#8217;s Gospel was primarily evangelistic in nature). Both textual variants enjoy significant ms support, although the present subjunctive has somewhat superior witnesses on its behalf. On internal grounds it is hard to decide which is more likely the original. Many resolve this issue on the basis of a reconstruction of the overall purpose of the Gospel, viz., whether it is addressed to unbelievers or believers. However, since elsewhere in the Gospel of John (1) the present tense can refer to both initial faith and continuation in the faith and (2) the aorist tense simply refrains from commenting on the issue, it is highly unlikely that the distinction here would be determinative for the purpose of the Fourth Gospel. The question of purpose cannot be resolved by choosing one textual variant over the other in 20:31, but must be decided on other factors. Nevertheless, if a choice has to be made, the present subjunctive is the preferred reading. NA<sup>27</sup> puts the aorist&#8217;s sigma in brackets, thus representing both readings virtually equally (so <i>TCGNT</i> 220).</p>
