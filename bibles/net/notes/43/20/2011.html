<A NAME="2011"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">11</span><note=1981><b>sn</b> The word translated <i>face cloth</i> is a Latin loanword (<i>sudarium</i>). It was a small towel used to wipe off perspiration (the way a handkerchief would be used today). This particular item was not mentioned in connection with Jesus&#8217; burial in John 19:40, probably because this was only a brief summary account. A face cloth was mentioned in connection with Lazarus&#8217; burial (John 11:44) and was probably customary. R. E. Brown speculates that it was wrapped under the chin and tied on top of the head to prevent the mouth of the corpse from falling open (<i>John </i>[AB], 2:986), but this is not certain.</p>
