<A NAME="2039"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=2009><b>sn</b> The statement by Jesus about forgive or retaining <i>anyone&#8217;s sins</i> finds its closest parallel in Matt 16:19 and 18:18. This is probably not referring to apostolic power to forgive or retain the sins of individuals (as it is sometimes understood), but to the &#8220;power&#8221; of proclaiming this forgiveness which was entrusted to the disciples. This is consistent with the idea that the disciples are to carry on the ministry of Jesus after he has departed from the world and returned to the Father, a theme which occurred in the Farewell Discourse (cf. 15:27, 16:1-4, and 17:18).</p>
