<A NAME="2054"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">54</span><note=2024><b>tn</b> Some translations treat <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pisteusante&quot;</font>) as a gnomic aorist (timeless statement) and thus equivalent to an English present tense: &#8220;and yet believe&#8221; (RSV). This may create an effective application of the passage to the modern reader, but the author is probably thinking of those people who had already believed without the benefit of seeing the risen Jesus, on the basis of reports by others or because of circumstantial evidence (see John 20:8).</p>
