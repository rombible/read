<A NAME="2032"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=2002><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the doors were shut&#8221;; &#8220;locked&#8221; conveys a more appropriate idea for the modern English reader.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> The fact that the disciples<i> locked the doors</i> is a perfectly understandable reaction to the events of the past few days. But what is the significance of the inclusion of this statement by the author? It is often taken to mean that Jesus, when he entered the room, passed through the closed doors. This may well be the case, but it may be assuming too much about our knowledge of the mode in which the resurrected body of Jesus exists. The text does not explicitly state how Jesus got through the closed doors. It is possible to assume that the doors opened of their own accord before him, or that he simply appeared in the middle of the room without passing through the doors at all. The point the author makes here is simply that the closed doors were no obstacle at all to the resurrected Jesus.</p>
