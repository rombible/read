<A NAME="102"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">2</span><note=995><b>sn</b> There was more than one type of <i>sheepfold</i> in use in Palestine in Jesus&#8217; day. The one here seems to be a courtyard in front of a house (the Greek word used for the sheepfold here, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#945;&#8016;&#955;&#8053;</font> [<font face="Greektl">aulh</font>] frequently refers to a courtyard), surrounded by a stone wall (often topped with briars for protection).</p>

More likely there are some details in this parable that are included for the sake of the story, necessary as parts of the overall picture but without symbolic significance.</p>
<A NAME="105"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=998><b>tn</b> The words &#8220;the door&#8221; are not in the Greek text but are implied. Direct objects in Greek were often omitted when clear from the context.</p>

<A NAME="108"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1001><b>sn</b> <i>He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. </i>Some interpreters have suggested that there was more than one flock in the fold, and there would be a process of separation where each shepherd called out his own flock. This may also be suggested by the mention of a <i>doorkeeper</i> in v. 3 since only the larger sheepfolds would have such a guard. But the Gospel of John never mentions a distinction among the sheep in this fold; in fact (10:16) there are other sheep which are to be brought in, but they are to be one flock and one shepherd.</p>
<A NAME="109"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1002><b>tn</b> The word &#8220;sheep&#8221; is not in the Greek text, but is implied.</p>

<A NAME="1014"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">14</span><note=1007><b>sn</b> A <i>parable</i> is a fairly short narrative that has symbolic meaning. The Greek word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#959;&#953;&#956;&#943;&#945;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">paroimian</font>) is used again in 16:25, 29. This term does not occur in the synoptic gospels, where <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#946;&#959;&#955;&#8053;</font> (<font face="Greektl">parabolh</font>) is used. Nevertheless it is similar, denoting a short narrative with figurative or symbolic meaning.</p>

<A NAME="1021"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1014><b>tn</b> Since the Greek phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#963;&#941;&#961;&#967;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7952;&#958;&#941;&#961;&#967;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">eisercomai kai exercomai</font>, &#8220;come in and go out&#8221;) is in some places an idiom for living or conducting oneself in relationship to some community (&#8220;to live with, to live among&#8221; [cf. Acts 1:21; see also Num 27:17; 2 Chr 1:10]), it may well be that Jesus&#8217; words here look forward to the new covenant community of believers. Another significant NT text is Luke 9:4, where both these verbs occur in the context of the safety and security provided by a given household for the disciples. See also BDAG 294 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#963;&#941;&#961;&#967;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953;</font> 1.b.<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#946;</font>.</p>

<A NAME="1024"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">24</span><note=1017><b>tn</b> That is, more than one would normally expect or anticipate.</p>
<A NAME="1025"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">25</span><note=1018><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;model&#8221; (see R. E. Brown, <i>John </i>[AB], 1:386, who argues that &#8220;model&#8221; is a more exact translation of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#955;&#972;&#962;</font> [<font face="Greektl">kalos</font>] here). </p>
<A NAME="1026"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1019><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;The good shepherd dies willingly.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Jesus speaks openly of his vicarious death twice in this section (John 10:11, 15). Note the contrast: The thief takes the life of the sheep (10:10), the <i>good shepherd</i> lays down his own <i>life</i> for the sheep. Jesus is not speaking generally here, but specifically: He has his own substitutionary death on the cross in view. For a literal shepherd with a literal flock, the shepherd&#8217;s death would have spelled disaster for the sheep; in this instance it spells life for them (Compare the worthless shepherd of Zech 11:17, by contrast).</p>
<A NAME="1027"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1020><b>sn</b> Jesus contrasts the behavior of the shepherd with that of the <i>hired hand</i>. This is a worker who is simply paid to do a job; he has no other interest in the sheep and is certainly not about to risk his life for them. When they are threatened, he simply runs away.</p>
<A NAME="1028"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1021><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;leaves.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="1030"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1023><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;seizes.&#8221; The more traditional rendering, &#8220;snatches,&#8221; has the idea of seizing something by force and carrying it off, which is certainly possible here. However, in the sequence in John 10:12, this action precedes the scattering of the flock of sheep, so &#8220;attacks&#8221; is preferable.</p>
<A NAME="1031"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1024><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;does not have a care for the sheep.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1032"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1025><b>tc</b> The phrase &#8220;he runs away&#8221; is lacking in several important <sc>mss (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>44vid,45,66,75</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A*<sup>vid</sup> B D L [W] <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> 1 33 1241 <i>al</i> co). Most likely it was added by a later scribe to improve the readability of vv. 12-13, which is one long sentence in Greek. It has been included in the translation for the same stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="1033"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">33</span><note=1026><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And I.&#8221; Because of the difference between Greek style, which often begins sentences or clauses with &#8220;and,&#8221; and English style, which generally does not, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has not been translated here.</p>

<A NAME="1039"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">39</span><note=1032><b>sn</b> The statement <i>I have other sheep that do not come from this sheepfold</i> almost certainly refers to Gentiles. Jesus has sheep in the fold who are Jewish; there are other sheep which, while not of the same fold, belong to him also. This recalls the mission of the Son in 3:16-17, which was to save the world &#8211; not just the nation of Israel. Such an emphasis would be particularly appropriate to the author if he were writing to a non-Palestinian and primarily non-Jewish audience.</p>

<A NAME="1050"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">50</span><note=1043><b>tn</b> Or perhaps &#8220;the Jewish religious leaders&#8221;; <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the Jews.&#8221; In NT usage the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;&#921;&#959;&#965;&#948;&#945;&#8150;&#959;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Ioudaioi</font>) may refer to the entire Jewish people, the residents of Jerusalem and surrounding territory, the authorities in Jerusalem, or merely those who were hostile to Jesus. (For further information see R. G. Bratcher, &#8220;&#8216;The Jews&#8217; in the Gospel of John,&#8221; <i>BT </i>26 [1975]: 401-9.) Here the phrase could be taken to refer to the Jewish religious leaders, since the Pharisees were the last to be mentioned specifically by name, in John 9:40. However, in light of the charge about demon possession, which echoes 8:48, it is more likely that Jewish people in general (perhaps in Jerusalem, if that is understood to be the setting of the incident) are in view here.</p>
<A NAME="1051"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">51</span><note=1044><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;is insane.&#8221; To translate simply &#8220;he is mad&#8221; (so KJV, ASV, RSV; &#8220;raving mad&#8221; NIV) could give the impression that Jesus was angry, while the actual charge was madness or insanity.</p>

This can sometimes be indicated by using a &#8220;tag&#8221; at the end in English (here the tag is &#8220;can it?&#8221;).</p>
<A NAME="1055"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">55</span><note=1048><b>tn</b> That is, Hanukkah or the &#8216;Festival of Lights.&#8217; The Greek name for the feast, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#8048; &#7952;&#947;&#954;&#945;&#943;&#957;&#953;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">ta enkainia</font>), literally means &#8220;renewal&#8221; and was used to translate <i>Hanukkah</i> which means &#8220;dedication.&#8221; The Greek noun, with its related verbs, was the standard term used in the LXX for the consecration of the altar of the Tabernacle (Num 7:10-11), the altar of the temple of Solomon (1 Kgs 8:63; 2 Chr 7:5), and the altar of the second temple (Ezra 6:16). The word is thus connected with the consecration of all the houses of God in the history of the nation of Israel.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> <i>The feast of the Dedication</i> (also known as Hanukkah) was a feast celebrating annually the Maccabean victories of 165-164 <sc>b.c. &#8211; when Judas Maccabeus drove out the Syrians, rebuilt the altar, and rededicated the temple on 25 Kislev (1 Macc 4:41-61). From a historical standpoint, it was the last great deliverance the Jewish people had experienced, and it came at a time when least expected. Josephus ends his account of the institution of the festival with the following statement: &#8220;And from that time to the present we observe this festival, which we call the festival of Lights, giving this name to it, I think, from the fact that the right to worship appeared to us at a time when we hardly dared hope for it&#8221; (<i>Ant.</i> 12.7.6 [12.325]).</p>

<A NAME="1084"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">84</span><note=1077><b>sn</b> A quotation from Ps 82:6.<i> </i>Technically the Psalms are not part of the OT &#8220;law&#8221; (which usually referred to the five books of Moses), but occasionally the term &#8220;law&#8221; was applied to the entire OT, as here. The problem in this verse concerns the meaning of Jesus&#8217; quotation from Ps 82:6. It is important to look at the OT context: The whole line reads &#8220;I say, you are gods, sons of the Most High, all of you.&#8221; Jesus will pick up on the term &#8220;sons of the Most High&#8221; in 10:36, where he refers to himself as the <i>Son of God</i>. The psalm was understood in rabbinic circles as an attack on unjust judges who, though they have been given the title &#8220;gods&#8221; because of their quasi-divine function of exercising judgment, are just as mortal as other men. What is the argument here? It is often thought to be as follows: If it was an OT practice to refer to men like the judges as gods, and not blasphemy, why did the Jewish authorities object when this term was applied to Jesus? This really doesn&#8217;t seem to fit the context, however, since if that were the case Jesus would not be making any claim for &#8220;divinity&#8221; for himself over and above any other human being &#8211; and therefore he would not be subject to the charge of blasphemy. Rather, this is evidently a case of arguing from the lesser to the greater, a common form of rabbinic argument. The reason the OT judges could be called gods is because they were vehicles of the word of God (cf. 10:35). But granting that premise, Jesus deserves much more than they to be called God. He is the Word incarnate, whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world to save the world (10:36). In light of the prologue to the Gospel of John, it seems this interpretation would have been most natural for the author. If it is permissible to call men &#8220;gods&#8221; because they were the vehicles of the word of God, how much more permissible is it to use the word &#8220;God&#8221; of him who is the Word of God?</p>
<A NAME="1085"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">85</span><note=1078><b>sn</b> The parenthetical note<i> And the scripture cannot be broken</i> belongs to Jesus&#8217; words rather than the author&#8217;s. Not only does Jesus appeal to the OT to defend himself against the charge of blasphemy, but he also adds that the scripture cannot be &#8220;broken.&#8221; In this context he does not explain precisely what is meant by &#8220;broken,&#8221; but it is not too hard to determine. Jesus&#8217; argument depended on the exact word used in the context of Ps 82:6. If any other word for &#8220;judge&#8221; had been used in the psalm, his argument would have been meaningless. Since the scriptures do use this word in Ps 82:6, the argument is binding, because they cannot be &#8220;broken&#8221; in the sense of being shown to be in error.</p>

Transcriptionally, the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</font> could have dropped out via haplography since the verb ends in the same three letters. On the other hand, it is difficult to explain the readings with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> or <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> if <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#950;&#8053;&#964;&#959;&#965;&#957; &#959;&#8022;&#957;</font> is original; such readings would more likely have arisen from the simple <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#950;&#8053;&#964;&#959;&#965;&#957;</font>. Intrinsically, John is fond of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</font>, using it some 200 times. Further, this Gospel begins relatively few sentences without some conjunction. The minimal support for the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#948;&#941;</font> and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> readings suggests that they arose either from the lone verb reading (which would thus be prior to their respective <i>Vorlagen</i> but not necessarily the earliest reading) or through carelessness on the part of the scribes. Indeed, the ancestors of <font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>45</sup> and D may have committed haplography, leaving later scribes in the chain to guess at the conjunction needed.
