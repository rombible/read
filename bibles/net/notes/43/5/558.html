<A NAME="558"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">58</span><note=426><b>sn</b> To whom does <i>another</i> refer? To John the Baptist or to the Father? In the nearer context, v. 33, it would seem to be John the Baptist. But v. 34 seems to indicate that Jesus does not receive testimony from men. Probably it is better to view v. 32 as identical to v. 37, with the comments about the Baptist as a parenthetical digression.</p>
