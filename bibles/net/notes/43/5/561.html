<A NAME="561"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">61</span><note=429><b>sn</b> <i>He was a lamp that was burning and shining. </i>Sir 48:1 states that the word of Elijah was &#8220;a flame like a torch.&#8221; Because of the connection of John the Baptist with Elijah (see John 1:21 and the note on John&#8217;s reply, &#8220;I am not&#8221;), it was natural for Jesus to apply this description to John.</p>
