<A NAME="55"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">5</span><note=373><b>tn</b> The site of the miracle is also something of a problem: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#946;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8135;</font> (<font face="Greektl">probatikh</font>) is usually taken as a reference to the Sheep <i>Gate</i> near the temple. Some (R. E. Brown and others) would place the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#959;&#955;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#8053;&#952;&#961;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kolumbhqra</font>) with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#946;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8135;</font> to read &#8220;in Jerusalem, by the Sheep <i>Pool</i>, there is (another pool) with the Hebrew name.&#8221; This would imply that there is reference to two pools in the context rather than only one. This does not seem necessary (although it is a grammatical possibility). The gender of the words does not help since both are feminine (as is the participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#955;&#949;&#947;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#951;</font> [<font face="Greektl">epilegomenh</font>]). Note however that Brown&#8217;s suggestion would require a feminine word to be supplied (for the participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#955;&#949;&#947;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#951;</font> to modify). The traditional understanding of the phrase as a reference to the Sheep Gate near the temple appears more probably correct.</p>
