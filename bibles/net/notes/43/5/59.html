<A NAME="59"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=377><b>tc</b> The majority of later <sc>mss (C<sup>3</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font> 078 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13 </sup><font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>) add the following to <b>5:3</b>: &#8220;waiting for the moving of the water. <b>5:4</b> For an angel of the Lord went down and stirred up the water at certain times. Whoever first stepped in after the stirring of the water was healed from whatever disease which he suffered.&#8221; Other <sc>mss include only v. 3b (A<sup>c</sup> D 33 lat) or v. 4 (A L it). Few textual scholars today would accept the authenticity of any portion of vv. 3b-4, for they are not found in the earliest and best witnesses (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>66,75</sup> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> B C* T <i>pc </i>co), they include un-Johannine vocabulary and syntax, several of the <sc>mss that include the verses mark them as spurious (with an asterisk or obelisk), and because there is a great amount of textual diversity among the witnesses that do include the verses. The present translation follows NA<sup>27</sup> in omitting the verse number, a procedure also followed by a number of other modern translations.</p>
