<A NAME="56"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=374><b>tc</b> Some <sc>mss (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> [L] 33 it) read <i>Bethzatha</i>, while others read <i>Bethsaida</i> (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>[66],75</sup> B T W<sup>s</sup> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#936;</font>] <i>pc</i> vg); codex D has <i>Belzetha</i>. A lot of controversy has surrounded the name of the pool itself: The reading of the Byzantine (or majority) text (A C <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920;</font> 078 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ë</font><sup>1,13</sup> <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>), <i>Bethesda</i>, has been virtually discarded by scholars in favor of what is thought to be the more primitive <i>Bethzatha</i>, even though many recent translations continue to employ <i>Bethesda</i>, the traditional reading. The latter is attested by Josephus as the name of a quarter of the city near the northeast corner of the temple area. He reports that the Syrian Legate Cestius burned this suburb in his attack on Jerusalem in October <sc>a.d. 68 (<i>J. W.</i> 2.19.4 [2.530]). However, there is some new archaeological evidence for this problem. 3Q15 (Copper Scroll) from Qumran seems to indicate that in the general area of the temple, on the eastern hill of Jerusalem, a treasure was buried in <i>Bet </i><i><font face="Scholar">á</font>Esdatayin</i>, in the pool at the entrance to the smaller basin. The name of the region or pool itself seems then to have been <i>Bet </i><i><font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8127;</font>Esda</i>, &#8220;house of the flowing.&#8221; It appears with the dual ending in the scroll because there were two basins. <i>Bethesda </i>seems to be an accurate Greek rendition of the name, while J. T. Milik suggests <i>Bethzatha</i> is a rendition of the Aramaic intensive plural <i>Bet </i><i><font face="Scholar">á</font>Esdata</i> (DJDJ 3, 271). As for the text of John 5:2, the fundamental problems with the <i>Bethesda</i> reading are that it looks motivated (with an edifying Semitic etymology, meaning &#8220;House of Mercy&#8221; [<i>TCGNT</i> 178]), and is minimally attested. Apart from the Copper Scroll, the evidence for <i>Bethesda</i> is almost entirely shut up to the Byzantine text (C being the most notable exception, but it often has Byzantine encroachments). On the one hand, this argues the Byzantine reading here had ancient, semitic roots; on the other hand, since both readings are attested as historically accurate, a decision has to be based on the better witnesses. The fact that there are multiple readings here suggests that the original was not well understood. Which reading best explains the rise of the others? It seems that <i>Bethzatha</i> is the best choice.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> On the location of the <i>pool called Bethzatha</i>, the double-pool of St. Anne is the probable site, and has been excavated; the pools were trapezoidal in shape, 165 ft (49.5 m) wide at one end, 220 ft (66 m) wide at the other, and 315 ft (94.5 m) long, divided by a central partition. There were colonnades (rows of columns) on all 4 sides and on the partition, thus forming the <i>five covered walkways</i> mentioned in John 5:2. Stairways at the corners permitted descent to the pool.</p>
