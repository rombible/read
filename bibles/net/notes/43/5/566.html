<A NAME="566"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=434><b>sn</b> <i>You people have never heard his voice nor seen his form at any time. </i>Compare Deut 4:12. Also see Deut 5:24 ff., where the Israelites begged to hear the voice no longer &#8211; their request (ironically) has by this time been granted. How ironic this would be if the feast is Pentecost, where by the 1st century <sc>a.d. the giving of the law at Sinai was being celebrated.</p>
