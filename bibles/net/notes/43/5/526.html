<A NAME="526"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=394><b>tn</b> Since this is a prohibition with a present imperative, the translation &#8220;stop sinning&#8221; is sometimes suggested. This is not likely, however, since the present tense is normally used in prohibitions involving a general condition (as here) while the aorist tense is normally used in specific instances. Only when used opposite the normal usage (the present tense in a specific instance, for example) would the meaning &#8220;stop doing what you are doing&#8221; be appropriate.</p>
