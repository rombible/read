<A NAME="578"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">78</span><note=446><b>tc</b> Several early and important witnesses (<font face="Greek Uncials">Ì</font><sup>66,75</sup> B W a b sa) lack <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font> (<font face="Greektl">qeou</font>, &#8220;God&#8221;) here, thus reading &#8220;the only one,&#8221; while most of the rest of the tradition, including some important <sc>mss, has the name ({<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;</font> A D L <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#920; &#936;</font> 33 <font face="Greek Uncials">Ï</font>}). Internally, it could be argued that the name of God was not used here, in keeping with the NT practice of suppressing the name of God at times for rhetorical effect, drawing the reader inexorably to the conclusion that the one being spoken of is God himself. On the other hand, never is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8001; &#956;&#972;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">Jo mono&quot;</font>) used absolutely in the NT (i.e., without a noun or substantive with it), and always the subject of the adjunct is God (cf. Matt 24:36; John 17:3; 1 Tim 6:16). What then is to explain the shorter reading? In uncial script, with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</font> written as a <i>nomen sacrum</i>, envisioning accidental omission of the name by way of homoioteleuton requires little imagination, largely because of the succession of words ending in -<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#965;</font>: <font face="Greek Uncials">toumonouqMuou</font>. It is thus preferable to retain the word in the text. </p>
