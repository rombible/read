<A NAME="111"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">1</span><note=1096><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="113"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">3</span><note=1098><b>sn</b> This is a parenthetical note by the author. It is a bit surprising that the author here identifies <i>Mary</i> as the one <i>who anointed the Lord with perfumed oil and wiped his feet dry with her hair</i>, since this event is not mentioned until later, in 12:3. Many see this &#8220;proleptic&#8221; reference as an indication that the author expected his readers to be familiar with the story already, and go on to assume that in general the author in writing the Fourth Gospel assumed his readers were familiar with the other three gospels. Whether the author assumed actual familiarity with the synoptic gospels or not, it is probable that he did assume some familiarity with Mary&#8217;s anointing activity.</p>
<A NAME="114"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">4</span><note=1099><b>tn</b> The phrase &#8220;a message&#8221; is not in the Greek text but is implied. Direct objects in Greek were often omitted when clear from context.</p>

<A NAME="116"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">6</span><note=1101><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;This sickness is not to death.&#8221;</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> Jesus plainly stated the purpose of Lazarus&#8217; <i>sickness</i> in the plan of God: The end of the matter would not be <i>death</i>, but the glorification of the Son. Johannine double-meanings abound here: Even though <i>death</i> would not be the end of the matter, Lazarus is going to die; and ultimately his death and resurrection would lead to the death and resurrection of the Son of God (11:45-53). Furthermore, the glorification of the Son is not praise that comes to him for the miracle, but his death, resurrection, and return to the Father which the miracle precipitates (note the response of the Jewish authorities in 11:47-53).</p>
<A NAME="117"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">7</span><note=1102><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;to God&#8217;s praise.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="118"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">8</span><note=1103><b>sn</b> <i>So that the Son of God may be glorified through it. </i>These statements are highly ironic: For Lazarus, the sickness did not end in his death, because he was restored to life. But for Jesus himself, the miraculous sign he performed led to his own death, because it confirmed the authorities in their plan to kill Jesus (11:47-53). In the Gospel of John, Jesus&#8217; death is consistently portrayed as his &#8216;glorification&#8217; through which he accomplishes his return to the Father.</p>
<A NAME="119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">9</span><note=1104><b>sn</b> This is a parenthetical note by the author. It was necessary for the author to reaffirm Jesus&#8217; love for <i>Martha and her sister and Lazarus</i> here because Jesus&#8217; actions in the following verse appear to be contradictory.</p>

(For further information see R. G. Bratcher, &#8220;&#8216;The Jews&#8217; in the Gospel of John,&#8221; <i>BT </i>26 [1975]: 401-9.) Here the phrase refers to the Jewish leaders. See the previous references and the notes on the phrase &#8220;Jewish people&#8221; in v. 19, and &#8220;Jewish religious leaders&#8221; in vv. 24, 31, 33.</p>

<A NAME="1118"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">18</span><note=1113><b>sn</b> What is the <i>light of this world</i>? On one level, of course, it refers to the sun, but the reader of John&#8217;s Gospel would recall 8:12 and understand Jesus&#8217; symbolic reference to himself as the light of the world. There is only a limited time left (<i>Are there not twelve hours in a day?</i>) until the Light will be withdrawn (until Jesus returns to the Father) and the one who walks around in the dark will trip and fall (compare the departure of Judas by night in 13:30).</p>
<A NAME="1119"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">19</span><note=1114><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;in the night.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="1122"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">22</span><note=1117><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#959;&#953;&#956;&#940;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">koimaw</font>) literally means &#8220;sleep,&#8221; but it is often used in the Bible as a euphemism for death when speaking of believers. This metaphorical usage by its very nature emphasizes the hope of resurrection: Believers will one day &#8220;wake up&#8221; out of death. Here the term refers to death, but &#8220;asleep&#8221; was used in the translation to emphasize the metaphorical, rhetorical usage of the term, especially in light of the disciples&#8217; confusion over what Jesus actually meant (see v. 13).</p>
<A NAME="1123"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">23</span><note=1118><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Then the disciples said to him.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="1126"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">26</span><note=1121><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;the sleep of slumber&#8221;; this is a redundant expression to emphasize physical sleep as opposed to death.</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> This is a parenthetical note by the author.</p>
<A NAME="1127"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">27</span><note=1122><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;and I rejoice.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1128"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">28</span><note=1123><b>sn</b> <i>So that you may believe. </i>Why does Jesus make this statement? It seems necessary to understand the disciples&#8217; belief here in a developmental sense, because there are numerous references to the disciples&#8217; faith previous to this in John&#8217;s Gospel, notably 2:11. Their concept of who Jesus really was is continually being expanded and challenged; they are undergoing spiritual growth; the climax is reached in the confession of Thomas in John 20:28.</p>
<A NAME="1129"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">29</span><note=1124><b>sn</b> <i>Didymus</i> means &#8220;the twin&#8221; in Greek.</p>
<A NAME="1130"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">30</span><note=1125><b>sn</b> This is a parenthetical note by the author.</p>
<A NAME="1131"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">31</span><note=1126><b>sn</b> One gets the impression from Thomas&#8217; statement &#8220;<i>Let us go too, so that we may die with him</i>&#8221; that he was something of a pessimist resigned to his fate. And yet his dedicated loyalty to Jesus and his determination to accompany him at all costs was truly commendable. Nor is the contrast between this statement and the confession of Thomas in 20:28, which forms the climax of the entire Fourth Gospel, to be overlooked; certainly Thomas&#8217; concept of who Jesus is has changed drastically between 11:16 and 20:28.</p>
<A NAME="1132"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">32</span><note=1127><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Then when.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="1135"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">35</span><note=1130><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;he had already had four days in the tomb&#8221; (an idiom).</p><p class="footnote"><b>sn</b> There is no description of the journey itself. The author simply states that when Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus had been in the tomb <i>four days already</i>. He had died some time before this but probably not very long (cf. Ananias and Sapphira in Acts 5:6,10 who were buried immediately after they died, as was the common practice of the time). There is some later evidence (early 3rd century) of a rabbinic belief that the soul hovered near the body of the deceased for three days, hoping to be able to return to the body. But on the fourth day it saw the beginning of decomposition and finally departed (<i>Leviticus Rabbah</i> 18.1). If this belief is as old as the 1st century, it might suggest the significance of the four days: After this time, resurrection would be a first-order miracle, an unequivocal demonstration of the power of God. It is not certain if the tradition is this early, but it is suggestive. Certainly the author does not appear to attach any symbolic significance to the four days in the narrative.</p>

See also the note on the phrase &#8220;the Jewish leaders&#8221; in v. 8.</p>

<A NAME="1141"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">41</span><note=1136><b>sn</b> Notice the difference in the response of the two sisters: Martha <i>went out to meet</i> Jesus, while Mary remains <i>sitting in the house</i>. It is similar to the incident in Luke 10:38-42. Here again one finds Martha occupied with the responsibilities of hospitality; she is the one who greets Jesus.</p>
<A NAME="1142"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">42</span><note=1137><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Then Martha.&#8221; Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">oun</font>) has not been translated for stylistic reasons.</p>
<A NAME="1143"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">43</span><note=1138><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;give.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1144"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">44</span><note=1139><b>sn</b> The statement &#8220;<i>whatever you ask from God, God will grant you</i>&#8221; by Martha presents something of a dilemma, because she seems to be suggesting here (implicitly at least) the possibility of a resurrection for her brother. However, Martha&#8217;s statement in 11:39 makes it clear that she had no idea that a resurrection was still possible. How then are her words in 11:22 to be understood? It seems best to take them as a confession of Martha&#8217;s continuing faith in Jesus even though he was not there in time to help her brother. She means, in effect, &#8220;Even though you weren&#8217;t here in time to help, I still believe that God grants your requests.&#8221;</p>
<A NAME="1145"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">45</span><note=1140><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Jesus said to her.&#8221;</p>

Martha apparently took it as a customary statement of consolation and joined Jesus in professing belief in the general resurrection of the body at the end of the age. However, as Jesus went on to point out in 11:25-26, Martha&#8217;s general understanding of the resurrection at the last day was inadequate for the present situation, for the gift of life that conquers death was a present reality to Jesus. This is consistent with the author&#8217;s perspective on eternal life in the Fourth Gospel: It is not only a future reality, but something to be experienced in the present as well. It is also consistent with the so-called &#8220;realized eschatology&#8221; of the Fourth Gospel.</p>
<A NAME="1147"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">47</span><note=1142><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Martha said to him.&#8221;</p>

<A NAME="1152"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">52</span><note=1147><b>tn</b> The perfect tense in Greek is often used to emphasize the results or present state of a past action. Such is the case here. To emphasize this nuance the perfect tense verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#949;&#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#965;&#954;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">pepisteuka</font>) has been translated as a present tense. This is in keeping with the present context, where Jesus asks of her present state of belief in v. 26, and the theology of the Gospel as a whole, which emphasizes the continuing effects and present reality of faith. For discussion on this use of the perfect tense, see <i>ExSyn</i> 574-76 and B. M. Fanning, <i>Verbal Aspect</i>, 291-97.</p>

<A NAME="1164"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">64</span><note=1159><b>tn</b> Or (perhaps) &#8220;he was deeply indignant.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957;&#949;&#946;&#961;&#953;&#956;&#8053;&#963;&#945;&#964;&#959;</font> (<font face="Greektl">enebrimhsato</font>), which is repeated in John 11:38, indicates a strong display of emotion, somewhat difficult to translate &#8211; &#8220;shuddered, moved with the deepest emotions.&#8221; In the LXX, the verb and its cognates are used to describe a display of indignation (Dan 11:30, for example &#8211; see also Mark 14:5). Jesus displayed this reaction to the afflicted in Mark 1:43, Matt 9:30. Was he angry at the afflicted? No, but he was angry because he found himself face-to-face with the manifestations of Satan&#8217;s kingdom of evil. Here, the realm of Satan was represented by death.</p>
<A NAME="1165"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">65</span><note=1160><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;greatly troubled.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#945;&#961;&#940;&#963;&#963;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">tarassw</font>) also occurs in similar contexts to those of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957;&#949;&#946;&#961;&#953;&#956;&#8053;&#963;&#945;&#964;&#959;</font> (<font face="Greektl">enebrimhsato</font>). John uses it in 14:1 and 27 to describe the reaction of the disciples to the imminent death of Jesus, and in 13:21 the verb describes how Jesus reacted to the thought of being betrayed by Judas, into whose heart Satan had entered.</p>
<A NAME="1166"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">66</span><note=1161><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;And he said.&#8221; Because of the difference between Greek style, which often begins sentences or clauses with &#8220;and,&#8221; and English style, which generally does not, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kai</font>) has not been translated here.</p>

This word simply means &#8220;to shed tears&#8221; and has more the idea of quiet grief. But why did Jesus do this? Not out of grief for Lazarus, since he was about to be raised to life again. L. Morris (<i>John </i>[NICNT]<i>, </i>558) thinks it was grief over the misconception of those round about. But it seems that in the context the weeping is triggered by the thought of Lazarus in the tomb: This was not personal grief over the loss of a friend (since Lazarus was about to be restored to life) but grief over the effects of sin, death, and the realm of Satan. It was a natural complement to the previous emotional expression of anger (11:33). It is also possible that Jesus wept at the tomb of Lazarus because he knew there was also a tomb for himself ahead.</p>

The author does not tell, and with a miracle of this magnitude, this is not an important fact to know. If Lazarus&#8217; decomposing body was brought back to life by the power of God, then it could certainly have been moved out of the tomb by that same power. Others have suggested that the legs were bound separately, which would remove the difficulty, but the account gives no indication of this. What may be of more significance for the author is the comparison which this picture naturally evokes with the resurrection of Jesus, where the graveclothes stayed in the tomb neatly folded (20:6-7). Jesus, unlike Lazarus, would never need graveclothes again.</p>

There are other plural anarthrous uses which have the general meaning &#8220;councils.&#8221; The fact that Caiaphas in 11:49 is referred to as &#8220;one of them&#8221; supports the unofficial nature of the meeting; in the official Sanhedrin he, being high priest that year, would have presided over the assembly.

Yet he was unconsciously echoing a saying of Jesus himself (cf. Mark 10:45). Caiaphas was right; the death of Jesus would save the <i>nation</i> from destruction. Yet Caiaphas could not suspect that Jesus would die, not in place of the political nation Israel, but on behalf of the true people of God; and he would save them, not from physical destruction, but from eternal destruction (cf. 3:16-17). The understanding of Caiaphas&#8217; words in a sense that Caiaphas could not possibly have imagined at the time he uttered them serves as a clear example of the way in which the author understood that words and actions could be invested retrospectively with a meaning not consciously intended or understood by those present at the time.</p>
