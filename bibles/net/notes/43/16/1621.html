<A NAME="1621"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">21</span><note=1582><b>sn</b> Here (v. 9) the world is proven guilty concerning sin, and the reason given is their refusal to <i>believe</i> in Jesus. In 3:19 the effect of Jesus coming into the world as the Light of the world was to provoke judgment, by forcing people to choose up sides for or against him, and they chose darkness rather than light. In 12:37, at the very end of Jesus&#8217; public ministry in John&#8217;s Gospel, people were still refusing to believe in him.</p>
