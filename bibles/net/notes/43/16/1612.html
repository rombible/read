<A NAME="1612"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">12</span><note=1573><b>sn</b> Now the theme of Jesus&#8217; impending departure is resumed (<i>I am going to the one who sent me</i>). It will also be mentioned in 16:10, 17, and 28. Jesus had said to his opponents in 7:33 that he was going to the one who sent him; in 13:33 he had spoken of going where the disciples could not come. At that point Peter had inquired where he was going, but it appears that Peter did not understand Jesus&#8217; reply at that time and did not persist in further questioning. In 14:5 Thomas had asked Jesus where he was going.</p>
