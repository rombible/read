<A NAME="1670"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">70</span><note=1631><b>sn</b> Jesus now compares the situation of the disciples to a woman in childbirth. Just as the woman in the delivery of her child experiences real pain and anguish (<i>has distress</i>), so the disciples will also undergo real anguish at the crucifixion of Jesus. But once the child has been born, the mother&#8217;s anguish is turned into <i>joy</i>, and she forgets the past suffering. The same will be true of the disciples, who after Jesus&#8217; resurrection and reappearance to them will forget the anguish they suffered at his death on account of their joy.</p>
