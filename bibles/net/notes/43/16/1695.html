<A NAME="1695"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">95</span><note=1656><b>sn</b> The proof of Jesus&#8217; negative evaluation of the disciples&#8217; faith is now given: Jesus foretells their abandonment of him at his arrest, trials, and crucifixion (<i>I will be left alone</i>). This parallels the synoptic accounts in Matt 26:31 and Mark 14:27 when Jesus, after the last supper and on the way to Gethsemane, foretold the desertion of the disciples as a fulfillment of Zech 13:7: &#8220;Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.&#8221; Yet although the disciples would abandon Jesus, he reaffirmed that he was not alone, because the Father was still with him.</p>
