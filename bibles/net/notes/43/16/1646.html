<A NAME="1646"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">46</span><note=1607><b>sn</b> The phrase <i>after a little while, you will see me</i> is sometimes taken to refer to the coming of the Holy Spirit after Jesus departs, but (as at 14:19) it is much more probable that it refers to the postresurrection appearances of Jesus to the disciples. There is no indication in the context that the disciples will see Jesus only with &#8220;spiritual&#8221; sight, as would be the case if the coming of the Spirit is in view.</p>
