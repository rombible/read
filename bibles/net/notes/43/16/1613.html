<A NAME="1613"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">13</span><note=1574><b>sn</b> Now none of the disciples asks Jesus where he is going, and the reason is given in the following verse: They have been overcome with <i>sadness</i> as a result of the predictions of coming persecution that Jesus has just spoken to them in 15:18-25 and 16:1-4a. Their shock at Jesus&#8217; revelation of coming persecution is so great that none of them thinks to ask him where it is that he is going.</p>
