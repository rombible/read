<A NAME="1694"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">94</span><note=1655><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;each one to his own&#8221;; the word &#8220;home&#8221; is not in the Greek text but is implied. The phrase &#8220;each one to his own&#8221; may be completed in a number of different ways: &#8220;each one to his own property&#8221;; &#8220;each one to his own family&#8221;; or &#8220;each one to his own home.&#8221; The last option seems to fit most easily into the context and so is used in the translation.</p>
