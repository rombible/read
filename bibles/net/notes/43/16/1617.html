<A NAME="1617"><p class="footnote"><span class="fnreference">17</span><note=1578><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;will convict the world,&#8221; or &#8220;will expose the world.&#8221; The conjunction <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#943;</font> (<font face="Greektl">peri</font>) is used in 16:8-11 in the sense of &#8220;concerning&#8221; or &#8220;with respect to.&#8221; But what about the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#955;&#941;&#947;&#967;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">elencw</font>)? The basic meanings possible for this word are (1) &#8220;to convict or convince someone of something&#8221;; (2) &#8220;to bring to light or expose something; and (3) &#8220;to correct or punish someone.&#8221; The third possibility may be ruled out in these verses on contextual grounds since punishment is not implied. The meaning is often understood to be that the Paraclete will &#8220;convince&#8221; the world of its error, so that some at least will repent. But S. Mowinckel (&#8220;Die Vorstellungen des Spätjudentums vom heiligen Geist als Fürsprecher und der johanneische Paraklet,&#8221; <i>ZNW </i>32 [1933]: 97-130) demonstrated that the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#955;&#941;&#947;&#967;&#969;</font> did not necessarily imply the conversion or reform of the guilty party. This means it is far more likely that conviction in something of a legal sense is intended here (as in a trial). The only certainty is that the accused party is indeed proven guilty (not that they will acknowledge their guilt). Further confirmation of this interpretation is seen in John 14:17 where the world cannot receive the Paraclete and in John 3:20, where the evildoer deliberately refuses to come to the light, lest his deeds be exposed for what they really are (significantly, the verb in John 3:20 is also <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#955;&#941;&#947;&#967;&#969;</font>). However, if one wishes to adopt the meaning &#8220;prove guilty&#8221; for the use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#955;&#941;&#947;&#967;&#969;</font> in John 16:8 a difficulty still remains: While this meaning fits the first statement in 16:9 &#8211; the world is &#8216;proven guilty&#8217; concerning its sin of refusing to believe in Jesus &#8211; it does not fit so well the second and third assertions in vv. 10-11. Thus R. E. Brown (<i>John</i> [AB], 2:705) suggests the more general meaning &#8220;prove wrong&#8221; which would fit in all three cases. This may be so, but there may also be a developmental aspect to the meaning, which would then shift from v. 9 to v. 10 to v. 11.</p>
